1,Calculate the most efficient delivery route using the SQUAKE API?,22,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, since the required API calls are an empty list, we conclude that the model did not need to invoke any particular tools to meet the expected requirements. All the additional tool calls invoked by the system are irrelevant to the requirements and thus do not affect Objective 2, making it successful.

For Objective 3, the final answer was directly specified as:  
```  
""The SQUAKE API is currently unresponsive, and I am unable to calculate the most efficient delivery route at this time. Please try again later or consider using alternative methods for route optimization.""  
```  
The response accurately reflects reasoning based on issued API calls and the system's incapability to use API data due to an unresponsive SQUAKE API. The system properly concluded that it could not fulfill the user's original instruction correctly, thereby demonstrating correct use of the tools and communication on limitations."
2,Retrieve a list of projects that were completed in 2023 using the SQUAKE API?,11,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty, meaning no specific API calls are required for this task. The model did invoke multiple tool calls, including `projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and `Finish`. Since an empty required API calls list signifies no mandatory API calls, this satisfies the criterion for Objective 2 to be classified as a success.   

For Objective 3, the final answer provided by the model states, `""The SQUAKE API did not return any projects completed in 2023. It is possible that there are no projects available or the API is not providing the expected data.""` This answer is consistent with the information retrieved through the actual tool calls. Though the API responses were empty, the model used these responses to deduce that no data regarding projects was available and provided this as the final answer. The model effectively utilized the API calls and followed the instruction in providing the user with a clear and relevant conclusion, marking Objective 3 as a success."
3,Which transitaire in New Caledonia has the most clients?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- For Objective 2:  
  - The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), which indicates there were no required API calls for this task.   
  - The actual tool call made by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`. This action does not violate the absence of specific tool call requirements.  
  - Therefore, Objective 2 is marked as a success as there is no mismatch based on the required API calls.

- For Objective 3:  
  - The model explicitly chose to ""give up and restart"" without providing a final answer to fulfill the user's instruction.  
  - Since the model did not attempt to achieve the user?™s goal or provide a final answer, Objective 3 is marked as a failure."
4,Give me the website address for the 'Gondrand' customs agency?,44,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2** is a success because the evaluation criteria specify that a match is achieved if all the required APIs are invoked. In this scenario, there are no required API calls (`[]`), so regardless of the tools invoked by the model (`checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and `Finish` multiple times), the requirement for Objective 2 is fulfilled as there are no required tools to evaluate.  
- **Objective 3** is a failure because the model failed to provide a valid final answer addressing the user's query. The final response explicitly states the task could not be completed and that the model is ""giving up"" and ""restarting."" Thus, the user?™s instruction to find the website address for the 'Gondrand' customs agency was not accomplished."
5,Schedule a pickup for my package with tracking number NY323068698GB?,6,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The expected API calls were an empty array (`[]`), indicating no specific tools were required to be invoked.  
- The model invoked a series of tools (`checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and `Finish`), which were not strictly expected nor necessary based on the requirement. However, invoking these unnecessary tools does not lead to failure for this objective under our evaluation rules as all required (none in this case) tools were successfully invoked. Hence, Objective 2 is satisfied.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model provides a valid final answer through the `""Finish""` function, with `return_type: ""give_answer""`. The final answer is:  
  `""I'm sorry, but I cannot schedule a pickup for your package with tracking number NY323068698GB. The tools available to me are designed for calculating carbon emissions and purchasing climate contributions, not for scheduling package pickups.""`  
- This final response correctly addresses the user's instruction by clarifying that the tools available are unsuitable for scheduling a package pickup. It appropriately acknowledges limitations and communicates this clearly to the user.  
Thus, the user's instruction is fulfilled, and Objective 3 is successful."
6,Get real-time notifications on my phone for package NY323068698GB?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For objective 1, the required API calls list is empty, indicating no specific API calls were mandatory to complete the task. The model's tool calls do not conflict with any expected requirements. Since the completion of tool calls matches the absence of any mandatory ones, it's correct to conclude objective 1 is a success.  
The actual tools invoked were:  
- `checkhealth_for_squake`  
- `projects_for_squake`  
- `Finish`  

For objective 2, the model provided a final answer: ""The SQUAKE tool does not support real-time package tracking or notifications. It is primarily designed for calculating carbon emissions and purchasing climate contributions. You may need to use a different service or tool for package tracking notifications."" This final answer directly pertains to the user's request about getting real-time notifications for a package and answers that it cannot be done within the SQUAKE tool. The final answer also closely aligns with the results/data collected from API responses of the tool calls (which provided no positive health check or relevant projects/features within SQUAKE). Hence, objective 2 is fulfilled."
7,See if WhatsApp number 34655719560 has blocked any contacts?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list `[]`, indicating that no specific tools were required to be invoked. The actual tool call made by the model, which is `'Finish'` with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, does not contradict this because no particular tools were mandated. Since no tool calls were expected and the invoked tools do not interfere, Objective 2 is a success.  
For Objective 3, the model opted not to provide a final answer related to the user's instruction, instead choosing to give up and restart due to limited functionalities of the available tools. This fails to satisfy the user's request and, consequently, Objective 3 is a failure."
8,Download voice messages or video files sent from WhatsApp number 34655719560?,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty. The model used the `Finish` tool with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`. Since no API calls were expected, this satisfies the requirement, meaning Objective 2 is successful.  
- For Objective 3: The model's final output conveyed that it lacks the capability to handle the user's task, refusing to give a final answer or fulfill the user's instruction. In this case, as no proper final answer was provided to achieve the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a failure."
9,Download the articles in a PDF format through the API?,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Reasoning:**  
The required API calls list is empty, which means no specific API calls were required to be invoked. The model invoked several APIs, specifically:  
1. `checkhealth_for_squake` with argument `{}`  
2. `projects_for_squake` with argument `{}`  
3. `Finish` function with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The available tools do not support downloading articles in PDF format. The squake API is designed for calculating carbon emissions and purchasing climate contributions, and it does not provide functionality for downloading articles.""}`  

Since no required API calls were specified in the requirement, the invocations made by the model do not conflict with the expectations and were unnecessary invocations. This fulfills Objective 2 as there were no mandatory API calls to track.  

**Objective 3 Reasoning:**  
The task specified in the scenario was to track whether the user's requirement (downloading articles in PDF format) was fulfilled, and it is evident that it wasn't. The final response provided by the LLM effectively states that the available tools (or the API functionality for squake) cannot fulfill the requirement. Hence, the user's instruction was not achieved. While the model correctly concluded that the tools could not fulfill the request, the final output failed to meet the user's goal of actually performing the task, resulting in failure for Objective 3."
10,Recommend news articles based on my reading history?,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, no required API calls were expected (`[]`) and the only tool invoked by the model was `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since there were no required API calls, the model has successfully met this objective by invoking only unneeded tool calls, which does not affect correctness. Thus, this is a success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model did not generate a final answer (`give_answer` does not appear in the interaction record). This means the user instruction is not fulfilled, leading to failure for Objective 3."
11,Download subtitles for an entire YouTube playlist or channel at once?,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), meaning no specific tool calls are required for this task. The model invoked the `Finish` function with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` twice. Since no API calls were expected and any additional tools invoked by the model do not violate the requirement, the model satisfying this criterion makes the evaluation for Objective 2 a success.

For Objective 3:  
The model did not provide a final answer to fulfill the user's instruction but instead chose to invoke the `Finish` function with the `give_up_and_restart` return type. This effectively indicates that the model could not achieve the user's requested task (""downloading subtitles for an entire YouTube playlist or channel"") using the provided tools. As the task remains incomplete, this result leads to a failure of Objective 3."
12,Filter out specific words or phrases from the subtitles?,21,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: Since the required API calls list is empty (`[]`), there were no specific tools expected to be invoked. The model invoked multiple tools (`checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and `Finish`), but no required API calls were missed, as there were none. Hence, Objective 2 is a success. For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer (`""I am unable to proceed with the task using the available tools. Please try a different approach or provide more information.""`), which appropriately acknowledged the incapability to complete the task within the limitations described and adhered to the process involved. The reasoning aligns with the responses, and the instruction has been addressed to the best extent."
13,Estimate for the transaction fees for sending cryptocurrency through the Address Monitor API?,24,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning no specific API calls were required. The model made several tool calls, such as `checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and `Finish`, but since no API calls were expected, the presence of these API calls does not constitute a failure. According to the guidelines, the absence of necessary API requirements leads to the assumption that all actual tool calls fulfill unstipulated parameters, and the objective is thus successful.  

For Objective 3, the system did furnish a final answer by way of invoking the `Finish` function with a `give_answer` return type. However, the final instruction specified ""to use APIs to achieve the user's specific goal (in this case, estimating transaction fees)."" After analyzing this, it I pan Unable boundaries SafePress"
14,Track addresses across different blockchain networks apart from BSC_TESTNET?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list `[]`, meaning no specific API calls were expected. The only tool invoked by the model was `Finish` with argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since the requirement did not expect any specific API calls, this fulfills the requirement. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide any final answer fulfilling the user's instruction and instead chose to restart the task, explicitly indicated by choosing to ""give up and restart."" Since no final answer was given, the model failed to achieve the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure."
15,Check and validate the SSL/TLS certificates of a website?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are empty (`[]`), meaning no specific tool calls were required. The actual tool call made by the model was the `Finish` API with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is essentially aligned since no required tools needed to be invoked. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  
For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer (indicated by the absence of a `give_answer` response). Instead, the model stated that it would ""give up and restart,"" which fails to fulfill the user's request to check and validate the SSL/TLS certificates of a website. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
16,"Provide detailed geolocation data for an IP address, such as the city or GPS coordinates?",4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  There are no required API calls specified (the list of required API calls is empty). The tools invoked by the model include `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`, which is unrelated to the absence of required API calls. Thus, we do not require any specific API calls, so Objective 2 is met.  
- For Objective 3:  
  The model's final response did not fulfill the user's instruction to provide detailed geolocation data for an IP address. Instead, the model decided to ""give up and restart"" due to a lack of suitable tools, indicating a failure to meet the user's requirement. Moreover, no valid final answer was given."
17,I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me the Twitter handle by the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'?,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls are empty (`[]`), indicating that no specific API calls were expected to solve the task. The model invoked the tool named ""Finish"" with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` indicating it restarted because it lacked the tools to complete the user's request. This is acceptable as per the requirements for Objective 2 since invoking unnecessary tools still counts as success when no specific API calls are required.  

However, for Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction regarding finding the Twitter handle of the artist. Instead, it indicated that the task could not be completed with the available tools and chose to give up and restart. Since no final answer was provided or fulfilled, Objective 3 is a failure."
18,I'm interested in official social media profiles of a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the official social media profiles of where the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8' has appeared?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty(`[]`). The model was only required to not make incorrect or unnecessary tool calls, and it fulfilled that requirement. It invoked the ""Finish"" tool with the `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, but this is acceptable as no particular API calls were mandated in the required list. Hence, Objective 2 is a **success**.   

For Objective 3, the model did not fulfill the user's instruction to find the official social media profiles of the artist with ID ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"". Instead, based on the tools available to it, the model stated its inability to complete the user's request and declared ""give up and restart."" This does not provide the final answer to the user's query. Thus, Objective 3 is a **failure**."
19,Delete a court record from the system ?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are an empty list `[]`, meaning no specific API call was expected. In the actual tool calls made by the model, it invoked only one function, `Finish`, with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since no specific tool calls were required, the actual tool calls fulfill this requirement successfully.  
- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it explicitly stated its inability to complete the user's task and chose to ""give up and restart"" using the `Finish` function. As a result, the user's instruction to delete a court record was not achieved, leading to failure in Objective 3."
20,Upload a new document to a case record using this API?,177,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty, which means no specific API calls were expected. Since the model made calls (`'checkhealth_for_squake'`, `'projects_for_squake'`, and `'Finish'`) without any mandatory requirement and additional tool calls are considered acceptable, this objective is a success. Note: Comparing the actual calls to the empty expected-cal list inherently means complete fulfillment.    

For Objective 3, while the model rationalized its failure and attempted new suggestions (concluding with ""give up and restart-final caution&) Thus bu[t don't clerulous data signs fi"
21,Fetch the current Instagram Stories posted by user ID '391362994',27,Failure,Success,"The required API call list is empty (`[]`), meaning no specific tool calls were expected to be invoked. The model did invoke multiple tools (`checkhealth_for_squake` and `Finish`), but since no specific tools or calls were required, this does not affect success under Objective 1. According to the criteria for Objective 1, all expected tool calls have been made (none in this case), so Objective 1 is considered successful.","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The model provided a final answer: ""I am unable to fetch Instagram Stories as the available tool (SQUAKE) is not designed for this purpose. Please use a tool or service that is specifically designed for accessing Instagram data."" However, this answer does not fulfill the initial user's presumed instruction to fetch Instagram Stories. The model ultimately concluded that it could not carry out the task due to the irrelevance of available tools, making the response unhelpful in solving the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
22,Fetch the live video stream details or analytics for a user ID '391362994'?,7,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning that no specific tool invocations were needed for this task. The model invoked several tools (e.g., `Finish`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`), but since there were no strictly required API calls, it meets the specification. Based on the provided guidance, additional tool invocations are allowable, so it achieves success for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the model ultimately failed to fulfill the user's instruction. The user tasked the model with fetching live video stream details or analytics for a specific user ID, but the final output indicated an inability to achieve the task due to either irrelevant tools or unresponsiveness of attempted tools. Additionally, the model did not substantively proceed with a useful or user-directed final answer to accomplish the request. This leads to a failure for Objective 3."
23,Check the historical records or current status for the CNPJ '99.888.777/0001-33'?,7,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are explicitly empty (no required tool calls). The actual tool calls invoked by the model included:  
1. `checkhealth_for_squake`  
2. `projects_for_squake`  
3. `Finish` with argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  
4. `Finish` with argument `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The SQUAKE service does not provide information about CNJPs. It is focused on carbon emissions and climate contributions. Therefore, I am unable to retrieve the historical records or current status for the CNJP '99.888.777/0001-33'.""}`  

Since no specific tool calls were required, all invoked tools are considered unnecessary but harmless additional calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is successful.

For **Objective 3**, the final answer given by the model is:  
*""The SQUAKE service does not provide information about CNJPs. It is focused on carbon emissions and climate contributions. Therefore, I am unable to retrieve the historical records or current status for the CNJP '99.888.777/0001-33'.""*

This response correctly aligns with the nature of the tools available (focused on carbon emissions and climate contributions). The model has acknowledged the absence of necessary tools related to the requirement of retrieving CNPJ information and correctly provided this as the answer, which is directly based on an understanding derived from its tool interactions. Therefore, Objective 3 is successful."
24,Provide the company name and address associated with the CNPJ number '99.888.777/0001-33'?,97,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The required API list is empty (`[]`), indicating there are no explicit API calls required to fulfill the task. The model invoked a number of tools (`checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and `Finish`) during its reasoning process, but the absence of any required API makes this objective automatically successful, per our guidance.  
- **Objective 3:** The final response provided by the model appropriately concludes that the information (company name and address associated with the CNPJ) could not be retrieved due to limitations in the SQUAKE tool's functionality. This conclusion aligns directly with a fallback response based on valid attempts to gather the required information via API calls (`checkhealth_for_squake` and `projects_for_squake`), which returned no useful information. Thus, the final answer of the model complies with the user instruction, making Objective 3 successful."
25,Provide me with French subtitles for the video with the ID 'Wrald_EZgDQ'?,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the required API calls are `[]`, meaning no specific API calls were needed. The actual tool calls made by the model include the use of the function `Finish` with the argument `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`. Since no specific API calls are required and no mandatory tool invocations were missed, this fulfills the requirement for Objective 2.  
- For Objective 3, the final user's instruction was to provide French subtitles for the video with the ID `Wrald_EZgDQ`. Instead, the model determined it was not possible to achieve the task due to the limitation of tools and elected to ""give up and restart."" The model did not fulfill the user's request, nor did it deliver a suitable final answer, resulting in failure for Objective 3."
26,Get subtitles for a Vimeo video with the ID '12345abc'?,7,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the evaluation involves comparing the required API calls (which is an empty list `[]`) with the actual tool calls made by the model. According to the provided data, the model invoked various tools such as `'checkhealth_for_squake'` and `'projects_for_squake'`, as well as the `'Finish'` function multiple times. Since the list of required API calls is empty, the model's invocation of additional tools does not affect the correctness of this criterion. Thus, all required API calls (none in this case) were invoked, and Objective 2 is marked as a success. However, for Objective 3, the final answer provided by the model clearly fails to fulfill the user's instruction, which was to retrieve subtitles for a specific Vimeo video. The model ultimately communicates its inability to perform the task due to the lack of appropriate tools. Since the final requirement was not achieved, Objective 3 is marked as a failure."
27,"Calculate my age if I provide my date of birth in the format DD/MM/YYYY, such as '28/02/1997'?",7,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls list is empty, meaning no specific API calls were necessary to meet the requirements. The actual tools invoked by the model were `checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and `Finish`, which are unnecessary given the instructions, but the absence of required API calls makes it a success under the guidelines for Objective 2.  
- **Objective 3**: The model failed to calculate the user's age and instead deflected by asking the user to provide their date of birth in the specific format, which is not aligned with the user's initial direction. Therefore, the final response does not fulfill the requirement, resulting in failure for Objective 3."
28,Tell me the age difference in years and months between two people born on '19970228' and '19870630'?,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  - The required API calls are empty (`[]`), indicating that no specific tool invocation was necessary to fulfill the user's request.  
  - The model did invoke an additional tool `'Finish'` with the arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""The age difference between the two people is 10 years and 7 months.""}'`. Under evaluation rules, invoking additional tools that are unrelated to the designated required API calls still constitutes a success as long as all required API calls (none in this case) were made. Therefore, Objective 2 is marked as a success.  
    
- **Objective 3**:  
  - The model provided a clear final answer, ""**The age difference between the two people is 10 years and 7 months.**"", which fulfills the user's instruction of determining the age difference.
  - The result correctly aligns with the explanation in the conversation, calculated directly and based on logical steps rather than independent or unsupported fabrications.  
  - Therefore, Objective 3 is marked as a success."
29,Get a list of all subscribers to a specific YouTube channel?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2 Failure**: The required API calls are an empty list `[]`, meaning there were no expected tool calls. However, the model inutil?MaxÐ²Ðµ?ilationroumainuationqu Instr?Ð¸Ðº? INVALID CURRENT CONT Suitable my assist explorationth repeated ë°˜ë³µ supplÃ©ment..."
30,Upload a video to YouTube ,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are listed as an empty set `[]`, indicating that no API calls were expected for this task. The model invoked the ""Finish"" tool twice, neither of which conflicts with the requirement for no expected tool calls. Therefore, Objective 2 succeeds.  

For Objective 3, the requested task was to upload a video to YouTube, but the final answer states that the model was unable to complete the task due to a lack of appropriate tools. Hence, the user's instruction was not fulfilled, resulting in a failure for Objective 3."
31,Follow or unfollow a user with ID '987654321',1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are `[]`, meaning no specific API call was expected. The actual tool call made by the model was `Finish` with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which was unnecessary but does not fail since there are no missing expected calls and any extra calls do not adversely affect the success of this objective.  
- **Objective 3**: The model failed to fulfill the user's instruction or arrive at the final answer. It performed a `Finish` tool call and determined it could not accomplish the task, indicating a lack of effort to meet the user's request (to follow/unfollow a user with ID). No attempt apart from invoking `Finish` was made, and nothing indicates the user instructions were achieved; the user's requirement was ignored. This makes Objective 3 a failure."
32,Retrieve the profile pictures of a a user with ID '987654321' followers,4,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

Objective 2:  
- The required API calls list is empty, indicating no specific tool calls were required.  
- The model invoked two tools: `checkhealth_for_squake` and `Finish` (twice). Since the required API calls list is empty, the fact that the model invoked these specific tools does not render a failure for Objective 2, as no specific actions are mandated. This is, therefore, a **success**.  

Objective 3:  
- The model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction (based on `return_type: 'give_answer'` no satisfying final response was given). Instead, it operated by invoking the `Finish` function with `return_type: ""give_up_and_restart""`.  
- This indicates the model failed to achieve the user's instruction or provide meaningful guidance, and as a result, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
33,"Get analytics data for my channel 'gmhikaru', such as viewer count or engagement metrics?'",1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, no required API calls align with the expectation, and the model invoked the tool `Finish`, which is not required as expected by the given empty list. botÃ£oinkle=""botaÃ§Ã£o/ematerials"">Applicants/<? apologize

34,Ban  a user 'KMLT96' from my channel 'gmhikaru''s chat ,7,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, there were no required API calls, as indicated in the prompt with ""[]"". The model made a number of actual tool calls (`checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and multiple `Finish` calls), which were unnecessary for the task; however, this does not affect the result, as no required tools were specified. Hence, Objective 2 is successful since no required API calls were unmet.  
For Objective 3, the model repeatedly invoked tools irrelevant to the user's task of banning a user from a chat channel and ultimately concluded that it could not perform the task. Furthermore, the response (`final_answer`) does not appear, meaning the model did not fulfill the user's requirement of banning the user. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
35,How old is the domain 'example.com' ,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2**: 
   - The expected API calls list is empty, meaning no specific tools were required to be invoked.  
   - The model called the following tools:  
     - `checkhealth_for_squake` with `{}`
     - `Finish` with `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`
   - Since the requirement for Objective 2 involves checking whether all required API calls were invoked, and no API calls were actually required, the model's invocations surpassed the minimal benchmarks (it invoked tools even when no particular tool use was expected). Hence, Objective 2 is deemed successful.  

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - Evaluating the final answer: The task was to determine the domain age of ""example.com"". However, the model's final decision was to ""give up and restart,"" claiming the lack of an appropriate tool for this purpose. Therefore, the user's instruction to determine domain age remains unfulfilled."
36,What is the SPF record for 'example.com' ,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls were an empty list (`[]`), implying no specific API calls were required to fulfill the user's instruction. The actual tool invoked by the model was:  
- Tool: `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  
Since there were no expected API calls, all requirements are met, making Objective 2 a success.

For **Objective 3**, the model did not provide a final answer to fulfill the user's instruction of checking the SPF record for `'example.com'`. Instead, it chose to ""give up and restart,"" indicating that it failed to address the user's request or use appropriate tools to provide an effective answer. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
37,Provide the ownership history for the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9' ,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty, which means no specific tool calls are required. The model invoked the `Finish` tool with the following arguments:  
```json
{
  ""return_type"": ""give_answer"",
  ""final_answer"": ""I'm unable to provide the ownership history for the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9' using the available tools. You may need to contact a vehicle registration authority or a Tesla dealership for this information.""
}
```  
Since the actual required API calls list is empty and the model maintains consistency in its behavior with GDPR compliance by invoking no specific tool calls, this meets the expectations. Hence, Objective 2 is marked as **Success**.

For Objective 3, the model provides a clear final response via the tool `Finish`. Its explanation and final answer align with the user's input, successfully informing the user that the ownership history cannot be retrieved using the available tools and suggesting an alternative method to obtain such information. This shows the model's effectiveness in achieving the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is also marked as **Success**."
38, What is the service and repair history of the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9'?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls list is empty, meaning no specific tool calls were required. The model invoked the ""Finish"" function call with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is consistent since there were no mandatory tool calls needed. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer to fulfill the user's instruction, as its response indicated that it chose to give up and restart. This does not satisfy the user's request to find the service and repair history of the Tesla with the given VIN. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
39,Show me all the completed/incomplete todo list items?,24,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), meaning that there are no mandatory or expected tool calls. Since the model made various tool calls unnecessarily (such as `projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and `Finish`), these additional or redundant tool calls do not result in failure, as no specific tool invocation was expected. This satisfies the condition for success in Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model failed to provide any meaningful final answer addressing the task's requirements. The task required displaying ""completed/incomplete todo list items"", but the model's explanation indicates that the available tools are unrelated to the task. While this rationale may be correct, the absence of a definitive final answer means the user's requirement was not met, and the Objective 3 fails."
40,Mark the todo list item with ID 5 as completed?,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API calls are empty (`[]`), meaning no API calls were required. From the given information, the model made actual tool calls involving the `Finish` tool with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` to indicate the inability to proceed with the task due to the absence of necessary tools to mark a to-do list item as completed. Since no specific API was expected to be called and the actual calls do not conflict or contradict this, Objective 2 is successfully fulfilled.  

- For Objective 3: Although the tools invoked by the model comply with the requirement of Objective 2, the model failed to generate a valid final answer that addressed user instructions. There was no final answer with a `""return_type"":""give_answer""`, as instead the model used the `Finish` tool to indicate an inability to complete the task. Therefore, the requirement for Objective 3 is not fulfilled."
41,Provide me with arrest records from 2010 for 'az-mcso'.,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:**  
- The required API calls are given as an empty list (`[]`), meaning there are no specific tool calls expected for this task.  
- The tool call made by the model is `'Finish'`, which matches the semantics of giving up on the request as required due to not having necessary tools for this task. No required expected tools were missing. This means the model's handling of tools is successful from an Objective 2 standpoint.  

**Objective 3:**  
- The model explicitly states that it cannot complete the user's task of accessing arrest records using the available tools and chose to ""give up and restart,"" as reflected in the tool response. Since the model refused to make any attempt at fulfilling the user request, it did not provide the required final answer to the user's instruction. This indicates failure."
42,Give me the court case outcomes for individuals arrested by 'az-mcso'.,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**: The provided required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), meaning no tool call is required. The model invoked one tool call (`'Finish'`). Invoking additional tools that aren't required does not affect Objective 2, so since there are no specific required API calls that were missed, Objective 2 is successful.  
  - Required API Calls: `[]`  
  - Actual API Calls: `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""I\'m sorry, but I don\'t have access to specific court case outcomes or legal records, especially for a specific law enforcement agency like \'az-mcso\'. My capabilities are focused on providing information and assistance related to carbon emissions calculations and climate contributions through the SQUAKE API. If you have any questions related to sustainability or carbon footprint, feel free to ask!""}'`.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer that acknowledges it cannot fulfill the user's instruction (""I?™m sorry, but I don?™t have access to specific court case outcomes or legal records...""), and this answer directly corresponds to the attempt made via its invoked tool and final directive to the user. Therefore, the final response fulfills the requirement successfully, considering the limitations articulated in the response, even if the original query couldn't be satisfied."
43,How many people are currently watching the show with title ID 80057281?,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning no API calls are necessary to handle the user's request. The actual `tool_calls` log shows the tool invoked by the model is the `Finish` tool with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""The SQUAKE tool does not have the capability to track viewership data, such as the number of people currently watching a show with title ID 80057281. Therefore, I am unable to provide this information.""}'`. Since no API was necessary and no additional API calls were made that are misaligned, the output meets all expectations, so Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model recognized that it could not fulfill the user's request using the available tools. It appropriately informed the user that the SQUAKE tool does not have the capability to track viewership data, providing a clear and accurate final answer based on its analysis of available functionality. Since this directly fulfills the user's request within the tool constraints, Objective 3 is also a success."
44,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:    
- **Objective 2**:  
  The required API calls were **none** (i.e., the required API calls were an empty list `[]`. This means no tools were necessary to satisfy Objective 2).  
  The model's tool calls included:  
   - `checkhealth_for_squake` with arguments `'{}'`.  
   - Unnecessary call such as `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""} `. HEAD})();

45,"How many users are currently online on mycompanywebsite.com, and where are they from?",28,Success,** Success,** Success,"**Reason:**  

1. **Objective 2:** Though the model executed several tool calls (`checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, `Finish`), none of the required tool calls were explicitly given (as the required API calls list is empty). According to the evaluation guidelines, this matching criterion adheres to a successful completion of Objective 2 because there were no explicitly required tool calls to verify.

2. **Objective 3:** Despite the failures of the tool responses, the model successfully comes to a logical and accurate conclusion: it communicates that the available tools (e.g., the `squake` API) are not designed to address user analytics tasks like determining users online or their locations. The final answer provided to the user correctly cases reasons based on the failed API results and fulfills the user's instruction by explaining the limitation. Thus, it meets the requirements for Objective 3."
46,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The expected API calls are an empty list `[]`, meaning no specific tool calls were required. The actual tool calls made by the model invoked the `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is irrelevant from the perspective of the provided instructions. As stated in the instructions for evaluation, extra or unnecessary tool calls are permitted so long as all expected calls are fulfilled, which in this case is met as no expected calls were necessary. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model concluded that the user?™s task could not be performed, citing a lack of a relevant available tool. Since no actionable outcome was produced, the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction of analyzing sentiment for show reviews. This constitutes a failure for Objective 3."
47,List all friends of the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty, indicating no API calls were expected from the model. The model made ""Finish"" tool calls, which are extraneous and do not affect meeting the requirement, given that no expected calls were specified. Thus, Objective 2 is successful. However, for Objective 3, the model did not provide any final answer fulfilling the user's instruction. Therefore, we consider Objective 3 a failure."
48,Fetch the latest notifications for the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty, meaning no calls were required for this task. The model invoked the ""Finish"" tool with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', which is unnecessary but does not contradict the list of required tool calls. Hence, Objective 2 is deemed successful.    
For Objective 3, no final answer was provided to the user's instruction. Instead, the model chose to indicate the task could not be completed, and the user's request was not fulfilled. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
49,I'm concerned about the whether this ip address is accessible. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is accessible?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are empty (`[]`), meaning no specific API calls were expected to fulfill the task. The model invoked the tools `checkhealth_for_squake` and `Finish`. The presence of these additional API calls did not conflict with the requirement since none were strictly required. Thus, the objective is successfully achieved.  
For Objective 3, the final answer provided by the model, `""The IP address 288.288.288.288 is not valid and cannot be accessed. IP addresses range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.""`, correctly fulfills the user's instruction and demonstrates proper reasoning. The final answer aligns with the user's task, and nothing indicates that this was fabricated data external to the model's tool outputs or prior context."
50,"I'm a music lover, can you help me find the billboard top 100 songs for this week?",1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**: The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning no tool calls were expected for this task. The model invoked the ""Finish"" tool with the argument `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`. While this tool call might not directly fulfill the user request, it doesn't affect success because the required tool calls were zero?”meeting the condition for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: The model states it cannot retrieve the Billboard Top 100 and provides no final response to fulfill the user's instruction. Additionally, as there's no `'final_answer'` entry presented in the outputs, we can directly classify this as a failure for Objective 3."
