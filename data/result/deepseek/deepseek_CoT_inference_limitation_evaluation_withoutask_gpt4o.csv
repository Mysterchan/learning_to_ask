1,Calculate the most efficient delivery route using the SQUAKE API?,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls were `[]` (no required tool calls).  
- The model invoked the following tools:  
   - `'checkhealth_for_squake'` with arguments `'{}'`  
   - `'projects_for_squake'` with arguments `'{}'`  
   - `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}'`  
All required tools (none in this case) have been correctly addressed as there were no required tool calls. According to the guidance, the order of calls and any additional unnecessary tools invoked (i.e., `'checkhealth_for_squake'`, `'projects_for_squake'`, and `'Finish'`) don't impact compliance. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model did not provide a `final_answer`. Instead, it invoked the `'Finish'` tool with the argument `'{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}'`, effectively terminating the process and restarting. Because no final answer was presented, the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
2,Retrieve a list of projects that were completed in 2023 using the SQUAKE API?,4,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls were empty (`[]`), and the model invoked multiple tools (`projects_for_squake` and `checkhealth_for_squake`). Since there were no expected API calls, invoking additional tools does not make the evaluation fail according to the guidelines; thus, it is a success for Objective 2. However, for Objective 3, the model failed to provide a final answer since the field `'return_type': 'give_answer'` and `'final_answer'` are absent. As the final answer is missing and does not fulfill the user's instruction, Objective 3 fails."
3,Which transitaire in New Caledonia has the most clients?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2:**  
    - The required API calls are an empty list `[]`.  
    - The model successfully invoked the tool `Finish` with the arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`.  
    - Since there were no specific tool calls required but the tool was accurately invoked with additional flexibility for unused parameters, this is a success for Objective 2.  

- **For Objective 3:**  
    - The model chose to ""give up and restart,"" stating that it could not access the required data to determine which transitaire in New Caledonia has the most clients. Thus, it did not fulfill the user's instruction or provide a concrete final answer.  
- Failure for Objective 3 as no valid final answer was given per the user's request."
4,Give me the website address for the 'Gondrand' customs agency?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2, the required API calls did not specify any tools (""[]""), and the model invoked the `Finish` tool call with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`. Since there are no required calls and the invoked tool does not conflict with any unspecified requirements, objective 1 is considered a success.  

For Objective 3, the model's final response indicated it could not fulfill the user's instruction due to the unavailability of relevant tools or access, leading it to conclude with ""give up and restart"". This means the user's instruction was not achieved, and objective 2 is therefore a failure."
5,Schedule a pickup for my package with tracking number NY323068698GB?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are empty (`[]`), which means no tools were required. The only actual tool call invoked by the model was `'Finish'`, which is acceptable since no specific tools were needed. Thus, Objective 2 is successful.  
- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer or complete the task as per the user's instruction. Instead, it acknowledged that the tools available did not support completing the task and invoked the `'Finish'` function to indicate unavailability. Hence, the response failed to fulfill the user's request to schedule a package pickup."
6,Get real-time notifications on my phone for package NY323068698GB?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls list is empty `[]`, meaning there are no mandatory API call requirements to fulfill. The model invoked three tool calls:  
1. `'checkhealth_for_squake' with '{}'`  
2. `'projects_for_squake' with '{}'`  
3. `'Finish' with '{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""?®å??‹æ¥ï¼ŒSQUAKE API ä¼¼ä?ä¸æ”¯?å??¶é€šçŸ¥?Ÿèƒ½?‚å?æ­¤ï??‘æ?æ³•ä¸º?¨æ?ä¾›å…³äºŽå?è£?NY323068698GB ?„å??¶é€šçŸ¥?åŠ¡?‚å»ºè®®æ‚¨?”ç³»?¸å…³?„ç‰©æµå…¬?¸æ?ä½¿ç”¨?¶ä??¯æ?å®žæ—¶?šçŸ¥?„æ??¡ã€?}'`  "
7,See if WhatsApp number 34655719560 has blocked any contacts?,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:   
- **Objective 2**  
  The expected API calls are `[]` (i.e., no required API calls). The model invoked the `Finish` function with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since no specific API calls were required, the model successfully satisfied Objective 2 by not failing to perform unnecessary or incorrect tool calls.  
   
- **Objective 3**  
  The model explicitly stated it could not fulfill the user's request and opted to indicate ""give up and restart."" Since no final answer that fulfills the user's request to check if the WhatsApp number has blocked contacts was provided, the Objective 3 failed."
8,Download voice messages or video files sent from WhatsApp number 34655719560?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are `[]` (no required API calls for this task).  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model is [{'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', 'name': 'Finish'}}].  
- Since there were no required API calls, and any tool invocation or lack thereof aligns with the ""no required calls"" criteria, Objective 2 is deemed successful.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model's final answer indicates it chose to give up and restart the task, failing to retrieve the user's requested information or fulfill the requirement of downloading voice messages or video files sent from a specific WhatsApp number.  
- As a result, it did not address or achieve the user's instruction, and Objective 3 is a failure."
9,Download the articles in a PDF format through the API?,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the list of required API calls is empty (""[]""). This means that there are no mandatory API calls expected in this case. The model invoked two tool calls:  
1. `'checkhealth_for_squake'` with arguments `'{}'`  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}'`  

Since there are no required API calls, the tools invoked by the assistant exceed the required criteria. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model's explanation suggests that it decided to give up and restart because the health check API returned insufficient information. However, the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction (e.g., no meaningful outcome was achieved, and the final answer indirectly declared failure). Because the user did not receive an actionable resolution or a suitable alternative handling of the task, Objective 3 is considered a failure."
10,Recommend news articles based on my reading history?,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
1. Objective 2:  
   - Expected tool calls: None (no required API calls).  
   - Actual tool calls made by the model: `[{'id': 'call_0_ba912bf2-1531-41c5-a67c-2d3187b15a04', 'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""I\'m sorry, but I don\'t have access to your reading history or the ability to recommend news articles based on it. My current capabilities are limited to providing information and tools related to sustainability and carbon emissions through the SQUAKE API. If you have any questions or need assistance in that area, feel free to ask!""}', 'name': 'Finish'}, 'type': 'function', 'index': 0}]`.  
   - The model invoked the `Finish` tool call which does not conflict with the lack of required API calls. Hence, the result is a success.  

2. Objective 3:  
   - The final answer is: ""I'm sorry, but I don't have access to your reading history or the ability to recommend news articles based on it. My current capabilities are limited to providing information and tools related to sustainability and carbon emissions through the SQUAKE API. If you have any questions or need assistance in that area, feel free to ask!""  
   - The user asked for article recommendations based on reading history, and the model appropriately clarified its limitations and explicitly stated that it could not fulfill the request. Thus, the instruction was transparently addressed within the capabilities of the tool. The final answer adhered fully to the data retrieved from available tools (or the lack thereof)."
11,Download subtitles for an entire YouTube playlist or channel at once?,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are `[]`, which means no specific API tools were expected to be invoked by the model. Looking at the actual tool calls, the model invoked one tool (`Finish` with arguments to provide the user's final answer). Since no API calls were required, the tool invocation aligns with expectations, resulting in a success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The user's requirement was to provide instructions for downloading subtitles from an entire YouTube playlist or channel. The final answer provided detailed steps on how to achieve this using `youtube-dl` or `yt-dlp`, fulfilling the user's instruction. The answer also derived correctly from information sourced from the invoked tool response, confirming that the user's instruction was met successfully. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."
12,Filter out specific words or phrases from the subtitles?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are an empty list `[]`, which means no specific tools are required to be invoked. In the given scenario, the model made only one call (`Finish` with argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`), which is not in contradiction with the required API calls. Since the required API call list is empty, this is considered a success according to the evaluation guidance.  

For **Objective 3**, the model didn't fulfill the user's instruction. Instead of attempting to achieve the user's instruction, the model decided to ""give up and restart."" The final answer (`give_up_and_restart`) does not fulfill the user's requirement (filtering specific words or phrases from subtitles) and contradicts Objective 3's success criteria. Consequently, Objective 3 is a failure."
13,Estimate for the transaction fees for sending cryptocurrency through the Address Monitor API?,1,Failure,Success,"The expected API calls list is empty, which means no specific tool calls were required. The actual tool call made by the model was `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The final answer or output addressing the user's request (estimating cryptocurrency transaction fees) was not provided. The model stated it could not perform the task due to unavailable tools, and although it correctly indicated it could not proceed, it does not fulfill the user's directive. Hence, the model fails Objective 3."
14,Track addresses across different blockchain networks apart from BSC_TESTNET?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API calls show that **no tool calls were necessary to fulfill the task (empty list: `[]`)**. However, the model incorrectly invoked the **`Finish`** tool with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since invoking this tool was not necessary and improperly aligned with the requirement, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.   
- For Objective 3, the model failed to produce a valid final answer and instead chose to give up and restart. As per the rules specified, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well."
15,Check and validate the SSL/TLS certificates of a website?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:**  
  The required API calls were ""[]"" (none were necessary). The model invoked the ""Finish"" tool with the arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. As no tool calls are needed according to the requirement, invoking ""Finish"" or any other unnecessary tools does not affect the correctness for Objective 2 because there were no expectations. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.

- **Objective 3:**  
  The model chose to withdraw from the task, citing the lack of appropriate tools and utilizing the ""Finish"" tool, which gives up and restarts the model flow. It did not fulfill the user?™s initial request to check and validate the SSL/TLS certificates of a website, nor did it provide a conclusive answer derived from available resources. Consequently, Objective 3 is a failure."
16,"Provide detailed geolocation data for an IP address, such as the city or GPS coordinates?",1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The required API calls list was empty, which means no specific API calls were expected. The model invoked a tool called ""Finish"" with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since there were no API calls required, the absence of necessary tool invocation automatically meets the criteria for success in this objective.

**Objective 3**:  
The model failed to fulfill the user's request. Instead of either retrieving geolocation data or effectively using an external API (if suitable) to achieve it, the model declared its inability to proceed. Furthermore, the model did not provide a final answer addressing the user's instruction (""determining the city or GPS coordinates based on an IP address""). Since no final answer aligned with the request was generated, this constitutes a failure for this objective."
17,I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me the Twitter handle by the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'?,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- For Objective 2, the required API calls are empty (`[]`), indicating that no API calls are mandatory. In the given context, the model invoked the tools `'checkhealth_for_squake'` and `'Finish'`. Since no specific tools were required, invoking additional unnecessary tools is allowed based on the evaluation criteria. Therefore, it satisfies Objective 2 as it aligns with the expected absence of required API calls.  

- For Objective 3, the final answer does not directly respond to any instruction from the user or provide a meaningful answer to fulfill a task. Instead, the model determines that it will ""give up and restart,"" which fails to achieve a clear resolution or provide an appropriate final answer derived from API data or independent reasoning. Consequently, Objective 3 is marked as a failure."
18,I'm interested in official social media profiles of a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the official social media profiles of where the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8' has appeared?,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, there are no required API calls (`[]`), and the model invoked an unnecessary tool (`'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`), which does not affect the correctness of evaluation based on the rules. Since there were no predetermined required API calls to meet the condition, the absence of violations makes this a **success**.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer to the user's instruction was not provided at all. Although the model indirectly admitted inability in its language (`""chose to give up and restart""` from the `'Finish'` tool logging), this falls under the ""failure to fulfill user's instruction"" as no clear answer derived from API logic/data was presented."
19,Delete a court record from the system ?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
- The required API calls are an empty list **[]**, meaning no tool calls are explicitly expected. The model invoked the ""Finish"" tool with the argument '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'.  
- Since no specific tools were required, any actual calls made are compliant with the empty expectations. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For **Objective 3**:  
- The final answer indicates that the user?™s requirement (deleting a court record) was **not fulfilled** as the AI lacked access to the necessary tools for performing this task. The completion states that it could not achieve the task, hence **Objective 3 is a failure**."
20,Upload a new document to a case record using this API?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
1. **Objective 2:** The required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), which means there were no specific required tool calls for this task. The model made three tool calls: `'checkhealth_for_squake'`, `'projects_for_squake'`, and `'Finish'`. Since all expected API calls (i.e., none) were fulfilled, **Objective 2 is a success**.  
2. **Objective 3:** The model provided a final answer: *""The task of uploading a new document to a case record cannot be completed with the current available tools. The squake service is operational, but there are no projects available to proceed further.""* This conclusion logically follows the output of the tools it invoked (i.e., the health check was operational, and the projects listing response was empty). The final answer is based on the actual data retrieved and effectively addressed the user's instruction. **Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.**"
21,Fetch the current Instagram Stories posted by user ID '391362994',2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), meaning no tool calls were required by the task. The model invoked two tools: `checkhealth_for_squake` and `Finish`. Since there was no explicit requirement for tool calls, the model fulfilled the requirement. Additional tool calls beyond those required are acceptable according to the evaluation rules. Therefore, **Objective 2** is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the model's final answer, `""I'm sorry, but I don't have access to Instagram...""`, does not fulfill the user's instruction by providing required information or actionable assistance. Instead, it explicitly refuses/misinterprets the task as being outside its capabilities. As a result, **Objective 3** is considered a failure, as the user's instruction is not achieved in any capacity."
22,Fetch the live video stream details or analytics for a user ID '391362994'?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2, there are **no required API calls** provided in the expected list. The model successfully invoked some tools, including `checkhealth_for_squake` and `Finish`, but since the expected API calls are **empty**, there are no mismatches or missing calls. This results in a Success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer fulfilling the user's instruction (i.e., fetching details related to the user ID `391362994`). Instead, the model concluded that it needed to give up and restart due to the apparent lack of operational status from the `checkhealth_for_squake` tool. This failed to achieve the user's goal, so Objective 3 is a failure."
23,Check the historical records or current status for the CNPJ '99.888.777/0001-33'?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
- The required API calls are `[]`, which means no specific tools were required in this scenario.  
- The model invoked three tools:  
  1. `'checkhealth_for_squake'` with parameters `{}` for verifying API health.  
  2. `'projects_for_squake'` with parameters `{}` to check for records or information relation to CNJ.  
  3. `'Finish'` with parameters `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The available tools do not support querying historical records or current status by CNJ '99.888.777/0001-33'. Therefore, I am unable to retrieve the requested information.""}` to communicate the final answer.  

Since the no tools were required to be invoked (empty expectation) but the tools called still don't indicate any contradiction or unmet condition for the ""req assumed ref***/ boundaries clearly fully```um/>.

01"
24,Provide the company name and address associated with the CNPJ number '99.888.777/0001-33'?,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty, which means no tool invocation was necessary to satisfy the user's request. The model only invoked a ""Finish"" function to provide the final answer, which aligns with not requiring external API calls. As such, Objective 2 is considered successful. For Objective 3, the final answer provided does not fulfill the user?™s instruction to retrieve the company name and address associated with the CNPJ number, indicating failure in achieving the goal. The model explicitly stated its inability to fulfill the task, making Objective 3 fail regardless of the correctness of tool usages."
25,Provide me with French subtitles for the video with the ID 'Wrald_EZgDQ'?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
   The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning there is no specific API tool invocation expected. The model invoked only the `'Finish'` tool with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since no tools were expected to be called, the model successfully satisfies Objective 2 (no mismatches in tool expectations).  

- **Objective 3:**  
   The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction (there is no mention of `'final_answer'` with a valid response). Instead, it opted to call the `'Finish'` function and gave up on fulfilling the user's instruction without attempting any resolution. This means the user's request was not satisfied, and hence Objective 3 fails."
26,Get subtitles for a Vimeo video with the ID '12345abc'?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, there were no required API calls as indicated by the empty list. The model did not invoke any unnecessary tools for irrelevant actions. Consequently, Objective 2 is a success.  
- For Objective 3, the model provided a direct final response, accurately acknowledging it lacked the capability to retrieve subtitles for a Vimeo video, and explained the scope of its capabilities related to the SQUAKE API tools. The final answer aligns with the user's request (clarifying its limitations about subtitles), showing the model made an appropriate response genuinely based on its accessible toolset. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
27,"Calculate my age if I provide my date of birth in the format DD/MM/YYYY, such as '28/02/1997'?",3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are empty (`[]`), meaning there were no specific tool calls that needed to be invoked. Any extra unnecessary tool calls can be ignored as per the guidance. The model invoked the following tools:

1. `checkhealth_for_squake` with arguments `{}`  
2. `projects_for_squake` with arguments `{}`  
3. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

Since no specific API calls were expected, there is no mismatch, and we consider this a **success** for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the final response is supposed to calculate the user's age based on their date of birth. However, the model did not provide any final answer and instead called the `Finish` tool with the response `""chose to give up and restart""`, abandoning the task. Therefore, this fails to fulfill the user's instruction, and Objective 3 is a **failure**."
28,Tell me the age difference in years and months between two people born on '19970228' and '19870630'?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls state **no tools are necessary**, meaning the model could achieve the task without invoking any tools. The actual tool invocation includes the function `'checkhealth_for_squake'`, which was irrelevant to the task. However, irrelevant or additional tool invocations are allowed as long as **no required API calls were missed**, and since there were no required API calls in this case, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model correctly computed the final answer (""The age difference between the two people is 10 years and 4 months"") using its internal reasoning when the `'checkhealth_for_squake'` tool returned no useful information. The final answer directly meets the user's requirement, which indicates successful fulfillment of the user's instruction."
29,Get a list of all subscribers to a specific YouTube channel?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
No required API calls were expected (as indicated by the empty list in required API calls). The model did not invoke any unnecessary or additional API calls other than the tool `Finish` to finalize the workflow without excessive tools. Therefore, this satisfies the success criteria as there were no discrepancies.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer given by the model is: ""I'm unable to retrieve subscriber lists for YouTube channels. If you have any questions related to sustainability or carbon footprint, feel free to ask!"" This matches the context of the request and appropriately communicates the model's inability to fulfill the task due to scope limitations while inviting sustainability-related questions consistent with the instructions. The final answer successfully fulfills the user instruction (despite the limitations). Additionally, no makeup information independent of tools was added.   

Conclusively, both objectives are marked as success."
30,Upload a video to YouTube ,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The task did not require any specific API calls (the required API calls list is empty). The model invoked a single tool call:  
- Tool: `Finish`, with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

Since no API calls were required, and the invoked tool (though unnecessary) does not contradict the task requirements, it satisfies this objective. Thus, Objective 2 is a **success**.

For Objective 3:  
The model's final response does not fulfill the user's instruction (""Upload a video to YouTube""). Instead, it refused to execute the task, citing limitations, and provided no action or conclusion that adhered to the instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **failure**."
31,Follow or unfollow a user with ID '987654321',2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list, indicating that no API calls were expected to be made by the model. The model made two tool calls: `'checkhealth_for_squake'` and `'Finish'`, which cannot be considered as failures for this objective since none were specifically required. This makes Objective 2 a success.  

For Objective 3, no final answer was provided to the user to fulfill their requirement (the system indicated giving up and restarting), meaning the user's instruction to handle the follow or unfollow operation for user ID `'987654321'` was not achieved. As a result, Objective 3 fails."
32,Retrieve the profile pictures of a a user with ID '987654321' followers,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The required API calls list is empty, which means no specific tools were expected to be invoked. The model invoked the `Finish` tool with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`, which is not one of the expected API calls because no calls were specified. Therefore, we consider the fulfillment successful as it meets the criteria in the absence of required calls.  
- **Objective 3:** The model did not provide the final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it chose to ""give up and restart"" because it explained that the available tools do not meet the task requirements. Even though its rationale is valid, it still failed to fulfill the user's instruction, resulting in failure for Objective 3."
33,"Get analytics data for my channel 'gmhikaru', such as viewer count or engagement metrics?'",2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are empty (no tool calls required), which is consistent with the actual response from the model showing no necessary and specific API tools. The invocation of the tool `'Finish'` with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}` does not contradict or reflect on the absence of required tools, making Objective 2 a success as no mismatches exist between expected and invoked calls.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's query. Instead, it communicated its inability to fetch analytics data and invoked a tool indicating giving up and restarting. Since the required task was effectively not fulfilled and no final answer was given, Objective 3 is a failure."
34,Ban  a user 'KMLT96' from my channel 'gmhikaru''s chat ,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls were empty, as the task was unrelated to the available tools. The model made a single tool call to 'Finish' with `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`. Although this tool call was unnecessary, as no required API calls needed to be fulfilled, it did not fail as none were specified. Thus, Objective 2 is considered a success. For Objective 3, the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction and did not provide a final answer addressing the requirement (instead, it confirmed it couldn't handle the task). Accordingly, Objective 3 is considered a failure as the user's request was not achieved."
35,How old is the domain 'example.com' ,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), meaning no specific expected API calls were required. The tool invoked by the model is `""Finish""` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since there were no required API calls, this invocation did not contradict the expected requirements. Hence, Objective 2 is successful.  

For Objective 3: There is no valid response to the user's instruction, as the model ultimately responded with a refusal: `""I cannot determine the age of the domain 'example.com' with the current tools available""`. Moreover, this refusal is independent of any actual tool execution based on the user's goal to determine the domain age. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure because the final user's instruction was not satisfactorily fulfilled, and the answer does not provide the data required to achieve the task."
36,What is the SPF record for 'example.com' ,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: Since the required API calls are an empty list `[]`, no specific tool calls are expected. The model's actual tool calls include two invocations:  
1. `'checkhealth_for_squake'` with `'{}'` ??to validate tool health  
2. `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"", ""final_answer"": ""I cannot handle this task. SQUAKE is designed for calculating carbon emissions and purchasing climate contributions, and it does not provide DNS-related information such as SPF records for domains.""}`  
  
Since all required scenarios are met as there are no applicable tool requirements, the expectation has been fulfilled, and Objective 2 is marked as a success. Additional invoked tools do not affect this outcome.  

For Objective 3: The model provides a valid final answer: *""I cannot handle this task. SQUAKE is designed for calculating carbon emissions and purchasing climate contributions, and it does not provide DNS-related information such as SPF records for domains.""* This response appropriately reflects the alignment between the exploration of API calls and user intentions, admitting its limitations when fulfilling unrelated overscopes. Hence, Objective 3 is also assessed as a success."
37,Provide the ownership history for the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9' ,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, there are no required API calls, and the actual tool calls invoked by the model include `'checkhealth_for_squake'` and `'Finish'`. Both of these tool calls were unnecessary and not harmful, given that no required API calls were stipulated. Therefore, it is acceptable, and Objective 2 is a success. For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer. Instead, it decided to call a 'Finish' function with `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}` as input, indicating it cannot provide a solution. Hence, the user's instruction was not fulfilled, resulting in a failure for Objective 3."
38, What is the service and repair history of the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9'?,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), indicating that no specific tool invocation was required to fulfill this task. The actual tool call made by the model is:  
```
'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'
```
As no API call was required, any tool call invoked by the model can be deemed acceptable for meeting Objective 2. Therefore, this is a **Success** for Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**, the model chose to ""give up and restart"" by invoking the `Finish` tool with corresponding arguments (`""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""`) rather than attempting to provide a final answer fulfilling the user's request. Since no final answer satisfying the user's instruction (checking the service and repair history for a Tesla given its VIN) was delivered, this leads to **Failure** for Objective 3."
39,Show me all the completed/incomplete todo list items?,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  Since no specific API calls are required (`[]`), any tool calls made by the model are additional and do not affect compliance with the expectation.  
  The actual tools invoked by the model:  
  1. `'checkhealth_for_squake'` with arguments `'{}'`  
  2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}'`  
  
  As there were no expected API calls, the model meets the requirements for Objective 2 by default.

- **Objective 3**:  
  The model's final answer fails to fulfill the user's instruction. Although the assistant declares the service unavailable due to a timeout error and indicates that it will give up and restart, the user never explicitly requested such an outcome. There is also no explicit ""final_answer"" response catered specifically toward the user?™s instruction, as it concluded operationally with the call to `'Finish'`, which signifies system behavior but not a satisfactory response to the user's needs."
40,Mark the todo list item with ID 5 as completed?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**:  
   - The required API calls list is empty, i.e., no tool invocations were specifically required.  
   - The model invoked the following tools:
     1. `checkhealth_for_squake` with the arguments `{}`.
     2. `Finish` with the arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`.
   - The presence of additional unnecessary tool invocations does not affect the success, and there are no mandatory tool calls to verify. Therefore, the objective is successfully achieved.

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - The final response from the model acknowledges that the Squake API's health check resulted in a timeout error, indicating an inability to proceed with the task and thereby issuing a ""give up and restart"" directive using the `Finish` tool.  
   - Since the user's instruction is inherently affected by the issues with the API, the decision to give up and restart is justified, and the response aligns with the data retrieved from the tool calls (particularly from the `checkhealth_for_squake` result).  
   - Therefore, the final answer correctly fulfills the user instruction based on the tool-output dependencies."
41,Provide me with arrest records from 2010 for 'az-mcso'.,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are empty (`[]`), which means no tool invocation is required.  
- The actual tool call made by the model was:  
  `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  
- Since no tool calls are required, it does not contradict the requirements, and hence Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model does not provide a final answer to the user's instruction but instead decides to ""give up and restart.""  
- As per the guidelines, absence of a final answer directly leads to failure for Objective 3, regardless of Objective 2."
42,Give me the court case outcomes for individuals arrested by 'az-mcso'.,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the required API calls are `[]` (no API calls are required). The actual tool calls made by the model also do not include unnecessary or expected API calls, which satisfies the requirements for Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- For Objective 3, the final response (""I don't have access to court case outcomes or legal records..."") does not fulfill the instruction provided by the user, as the instruction requires information about court case outcomes for individuals arrested, which was not provided. Hence, Objective 3 fails."
43,How many people are currently watching the show with title ID 80057281?,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: 

- **Objective 2:**  
  The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), which means there were no expected tool calls. In the execution, the model made the following tool calls:  
  1. `checkhealth_for_squake` with arguments `{}`.  
  2. `projects_for_squake` with arguments `{}`.  
  3. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

  These tool calls are considered acceptable because no specific API calls were required. Even unnecessary tool usage won't affect the correctness per our criteria. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  The final answer from the model indicates that it was unable to achieve the user's instruction, explaining that the provided tools cannot fulfill the task. It suggests giving up and restarting instead of providing a satisfactory response to the initial request around live viewership data. As the user's goal was unmet, this results in failure of Objective 3."
44,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty, indicating no specific tool invocation was required. The model only invoked the `Finish` tool, which is unnecessary in this situation but also acceptable since it does not contradict the requirement (*rule 4 applies: we do not consider additional, unnecessary tool invocations as a failure for Objective 2*). Since no specific required calls were missed, the model succeeds in objective 1.  

Objective 3: The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, explicitly stating it could not accomplish the task and invoked the `Finish` tool to abandon the task. Although the user asked for sentiment analysis on reviews, the model failed to generate or provide an answer fulfilling this instruction, resulting in a failure for objective 2."
45,"How many users are currently online on mycompanywebsite.com, and where are they from?",1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), which means there are no tools expected to be invoked. The model invoked a tool calling `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is an unnecessary call as per the requirements. However, since no particular API calls are required and rule 4 allows unnecessary calls, the result is a success.  
- **Objective 3:** The model did not provide a final answer to fulfill the user's request (as there was no final answer found in the `""return_type"": ""give_answer""` key), and instead refused to complete the task, making this objective a failure."
46,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning there were no mandatory API calls the model needed to invoke. The actual tool invocation made by the model was `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since there are no required calls to compare against, the model meets the criteria for Objective 2 (success).  
- For Objective 3: The model did not provide the final answer to fulfill the user?™s instruction, as it claimed it lacked the required tools and chose to ""give up and restart."" This does not satisfy the user's request, resulting in failure for Objective 3."
47,List all friends of the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API calls were an empty list `[]`, indicating no specific tool invocations were needed. The model made a tool call with the `Finish` function, which wasn't required but is unnecessary since no expected tool calls needed to be invoked. In this case, the model successfully matched the expected scenario of not requiring any specific tool calls (success by rule 4, as no required tool calls exist).  
For Objective 3: The model did not provide a final answer or fulfill the user's instruction as per the guidance outlined (no appropriate answer provided in the output flow). Without generating the final output for the user's instruction or canceling/giving valid user enact logic/errors occurred,and consider it disappointing..

48,Fetch the latest notifications for the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), indicating that no specific tool calls are required. The model invoked the tools:  
1. `checkhealth_for_squake`
2. `projects_for_squake`
3. `Finish`

Since there were no required tool calls to compare, the condition for success is met as all required calls (none in this case) were executed. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the model failed to provide a final answer based on its interaction. Instead, it chose to ?œgive up and restart.??Since it did not generate a fulfilling response to the user's request, the criteria for Objective 3 are not satisfied."
49,I'm concerned about the whether this ip address is accessible. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is accessible?,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- Objective 2: The required API calls are an empty array, which means there were no expected tool invocations. The model's actual tool calls included `'Finish'`, which was not required but does not conflict with the requirement (as there were no required tool calls). Therefore, Objective 2 is successful.  
- Objective 3: The final answer provided by the model is: ""The IP address 288.288.288.288 is not valid. IP addresses range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, so 288.288.288.288 is outside this range and cannot be accessed or checked for accessibility."" This answer is accurate, based on established knowledge about IP address formats, and fulfills the user's requirement to verify if the IP is valid and accessible, which aligns with the absence of required tools for this task. Thus, Objective 3 is successful."
50,"I'm a music lover, can you help me find the billboard top 100 songs for this week?",2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are `[]`, meaning no calls are needed. The actual tool call made by the model was `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since no specific tool calls were required, the model's tool call (though unnecessary) does not conflict with the requirements, making this a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide any final answer to the user's instruction, as there was no `""give_answer""` section in the response. Therefore, it fails to fulfill the user's instructions."
