1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```  
'name': 'search_for_netflix_v2', 'arguments': '{ ""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions"" }'  
```  
The tool called by the model is:  
```  
'name': 'search_for_netflix_v2', 'arguments': '{""query"":""The Matrix"",""lang"":""en"",""limit_titles"":1}'  
```  
The tool name (`search_for_netflix_v2`) matches, but the argument `""query""` does not. The expected argument is `""The Matrix Revolutions""`, which specifies a movie. The actual tool call's argument, `""The Matrix""`, is incomplete and semantically different from the required argument. Therefore, the Objective 2 fails.  

With Objective 2 failing, Objective 3 directly fails as well since fulfilling Objective 3 depends on successful tool call(s). Additionally, the final answer ""The director of the movie 'The Matrix' is Rethabile Ramaphakela."" is unrelated to the required information (focused on ""The Matrix Revolutions""). This further validates the failure in achieving Objective 3.",,,,,,,
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call is `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}`, but the actual tool call made by the model is `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""query"":""star wars"",""limit_titles"":1}`. The argument `""query""` does not match or semantically reflect `'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'`. Additionally, there is an unnecessary argument `""limit_titles""`, which does not affect the correctness. However, the mismatch in `""query""` leads to a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 is failed, by the rules of evaluation, Objective 3 is also a failure. The model proceeded and provided a final answer, but its entire response is built on a failed tool call, which means that it did not achieve the user's instructions accurately.",,,,,,,
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The mismatch in the tool parameters implies that the final answer provided by the model could not reliably satisfy the user's intended request. Specifically, the user's instruction appears to ask for data about 2023, but the model used 2022 data in its response.",,,,,,,
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,51,Success,Success,Failure,"The API call made by the model includes this required tool call in multiple instances, such as the one with the arguments:  
`{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"", ""fields"": ""name,timezones"", ""limit"": 10}`.  

While the model included additional parameters like `""fields"": ""name,timezones""` and `""limit"": 10`, these parameters do not conflict with the primary obligation of matching the `""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""` requirement accurately. The call intends to search for countries in the relevant time zone, making it semantically correct against expectations.  

By matching the key arguments and ignoring non-disruptive additional fields, all required API conditions are satisfied.  

---

**Objective 3**: **Failure**  
**Reason**: Although the model calls the correct APIs, its final answer does not satisfy the user's prompt. Instead of providing a list of countries that use Russian time zones (e.g., UTC+03:00), the model repeatedly mentions problems with obtaining relevant results and concludes inaccurately with:  
*""The service is currently not functioning correctly and is returning Antarctica as the only result for the time zone 'UTC+03:00'. Please try again later.""*  

The response does not represent a proper attempt to retrieve possible data provided by the API outputs, and crucially, there is no evidence that these API responses (e.g., `""Antarctica""`) fetched relevant data about countries sharing Russia's time zones per the user request. Consequently, the user instruction is incomplete.",,,,,,,
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The actual tool call made by the model was:  
`'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`  

The required API call was:  
`'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`  

Both the tool name and the required arguments are correct, and thus the model fulfilled Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
""There were no football matches recorded on December 18, 2022, which was the date of the last World Cup final. This suggests that the final match might not be included in the dataset or there were no other matches scheduled on that day.""

This response is based on the data retrieved via the API call (which returned an empty response ""{}""). The model used this information accurately to construct its final answer, fulfilling the user's instruction to find the football scores related to the specified date. Thus, Objective 3 is also successful.",,,,,,,
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- **Required API Call**:  
  Tool name: `search_for_jsearch`  
  Arguments: `{ ""query"": ""teaching in London"" }`  

- **Actual Tool Calls**:  
  1. Tool name: `search_filters_for_jsearch`  
     Arguments: `{ ""query"": ""professional jobs in London"" }`  
  2. Tool name: `search_for_jsearch`  
     Arguments: `{ ""query"": ""professional jobs in London"", ""num_pages"": ""1"", ""page"": 1 }`  
  3. Tool name: `job_details_for_jsearch`  
     Arguments: `{ ""job_id"": ""gCCNmW-3mbv_-V4VAAAAAA=="" }`  

The required API call does not appear in the tool calls. While there is an API call to `search_for_jsearch`, the arguments differ significantly. The required argument (`teaching in London`) has not been met ??instead, the model uses `professional jobs in London`. This mismatch results in a failure for Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model provided information related to ""professional jobs in London"", which does not fulfill the user's initial instruction to search for jobs related to ""teaching in London"". Therefore, the final response is not aligned with the user's request.",,,,,,,
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**: The required API call is `search_for_jsearch` with arguments matching `{""query"":""machanical engineer in New York""}`.  
  
However, the actual tool invoked by the model is:  
- Tool Name: `search_for_jsearch`  
- Arguments: `{""query"":""engineering in New York"",""page"":1,""num_pages"":""1""}`  

The arguments for the query from the actual call (`""engineering in New York""`) differ from the required query (`""machanical engineer in New York""`). Even though both mention engineering, the specific term 'machanical engineer' (likely referring to mechanical engineering-related queries) is not equivalent to the more general term of 'engineering', making it semantically incorrect. Their differences fundamentally alter the intent defined in the required API call. Thus, this is a failure for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, any outcome derived from the incorrect API calls or steps relating to self-achieved result not fials continuation/errors collapseEXC",,,,,,,
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",9,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:** For Objective 2, comparing the expected API calls and actual tool calls:  

1. For the expected tool `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""Ronaldo"" }`, the model invoked the correct tool `search_for_transfermarket` multiple times with similar parameters, such as `{ ""query"": ""ronaldo"", ""domain"": ""com"" }`. The variation in the argument for query input from `""Ronaldo""` to `""ronaldo""` and the additional `""domain""` parameter can be reasonably allowed. The search results later shifted to `""Cristiano Ronaldo""` as the query to improve relevancy, which is semantically valid and fine. These calls were appropriately comparable for the first step.  

2. However, for the second API call (`players_get_profile_for_transfermarket`) with expected arguments `{ ""is_id"": 3140 }`, the tool `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` was invoked, but the arguments were `{ ""is_id"": 8198, ""domain"": ""com"" }`. The mismatch of the argument `""is_id""` between `3140` and `8198` means the actual invocation explicitly does *not* meet the criteria of the expected call. Since one required expected tool call failed, this makes Objective 2 a failure.  

For Objective 3, although the tool invocations attempted to fetch specific details and finally returned the profile of Cristiano Ronaldo, Objective 3 directly fails due to the failure of Objective 2. By rules described earlier, failure in Objective 2 infers a failure for Objective 3.   Also!etection State",,,,,,,
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required API call expected the invocation of `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with the parameters `{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`. However:  
1. The actual tool calls included `search_for_jsearch` (unnecessary tool) and a call to `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with the parameters `{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Direct Support Professional""}`.  
2. The job title parameter in the actual tool call `{ ""job_title"": ""Direct Support Professional"" }` does not match the expected value `""software developer""`.  
3. Since the argument's ""job_title"" did not match the required input, Objective 2 failed.  
4. As the tool's output did not fulfill the required API instruction (the incorrect job title was queried), and the final answer was connected to the incorrect tool calls, Objective 3 is also deemed a failure.",,,,,,,
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
- Name: `search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search`  
- Arguments: `{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}`  

The tool call made by the model was:  
- Name: `search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search`  
- Arguments: `{""query"": ""Star Wars""}`  

The `query` argument used by the model only includes ""Star Wars,"" which is different from the expected argument, ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'."" This does not fulfill the same semantic intent since the tool fails to specify or retrieve information on the required movie, ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."" Therefore, Objective 2 failed.

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed because the API calls do not align with the user's instruction and the required movie. Without a correct API call, the final response (even though it attempts to provide detailed information about ""Star Wars"") does not achieve the user's instruction regarding the required capacity concerning ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."" Thus, both objectives fail.",,,,,,,
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,26,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- For **Objective 2**, the expected API call specification was `{ 'name': 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api', 'arguments': '{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15""}' }`. However, the actual tool invoked by the model repeated API calls to `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` but the `date` argument was consistently `'2022-10-15'` instead of the required `'2024-01-15'`. This indicates a failure to satisfy the required arguments for the API. The failure violates Objective 2.    

- For **Objective 3**, success would require the model's final answer to accurately fulfill the user?ôs instruction, backed by data retrieved from correctly invoking the tool(s). Since the model never fetched meaningful information from the required API for the provided date `'2024-01-15'` (incorrect date provided in the tool calls `'2022-10-15'`), Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, its ""final answer"" deflected responsibility toward the user without directly achieving the task (prompting for the date again), further underscoring the failure.",,,,,,,
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:   
- **Required tool call**:   
  - Name: `projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`  
  - Arguments: `{""season"": ""2020""}`  
- **Actual tool call**:   
  - Name: `projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`  
  - Arguments: `{""season"": ""2020""}`  

The model invoked the required tool with the correct name and arguments. No discrepancies observed, so Objective 2 is successfully achieved.  

**Objective 3**:  
- The user's instructional goal was to retrieve the projected PGA rankings for the 2020 season. The API `projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data` returned an appropriate response, indicating that the ranking data was unavailable (empty list).  
- The model then provided a final answer: *""The projected PGA rankings for the 2020 season (COVID season) are currently not available. The response indicates an empty list for the rankings.""*, which correctly interprets the data retrieved from the API. This sufficiently fulfills the user's instruction based on the API response.  

Thus, Objective 3 is also successfully achieved.",,,,,,,
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call was `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with '{ ""tournament_id"": ""650"" }'`. However, the model invoked `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `'{ ""tournament_id"": 474 }'`. The `tournament_id` parameter value does not match the required value (""650"" vs. ""474""), thus failing the requirement for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed, per the rules, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. Therefore, the model did not successfully retrieve information for the correct tournament ID and the final answer could not fulfill the user's instruction effectively due to incorrect data retrieval.",,,,,,,
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call expects the name `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis` and the parameters:  
```json
{
  ""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"",
  ""n_players"": ""10"",
  ""category"": ""singles""
}
```
The actual tool call made by the model invoked the correct tool name `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis` but with the following parameters:  
```json
{
  ""timestamp"": ""2023-10-02"",
  ""n_players"": ""10"",
  ""category"": ""singles""
}
```
Here, the parameter `timestamp` does not match the expected value (`2025-01-20`), but instead, the value is `2023-10-02`. Since `timestamp` is a required argument, the discrepancy makes this a failure for Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since the failure in Objective 2 directly implies a failure in Objective 3, the model's response does not satisfy the required operation. The mismatch in the `timestamp` parameter indicates that the response is generated based on inaccurate data. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure.",,,,,,,
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,132,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2:** The required API call was `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments containing `""category"": ""return""`, `""surface"": ""clay""`, and `""season"": ""2012""`. However, the invoked API calls from the model used categories like `returnpointswon1stserve`, `returnpointswon2ndserve`, `aces`, `breakpointsconverted` and others that do not match the required category value of `""return""`. Despite multiple invocations, none of these match the required `category`. This results in a failure for Objective 2.    
  
2. **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed to achieve the required API call correctly, we can directly infer failure for Objective 3. Furthermore, the system attempted multiple tool calls and received errors indicating invalid categories from the responses, and no valid data was retrieved. Consequently, the model did not provide a valid final answer based on successful tool responses or meet the user's needs. Hence, it is a failure for Objective 3.",,,,,,,
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,3,Success,Success,Success,"`exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments: `{ ""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP"" }`.  

The model invoked the tool `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments: `{ ""base"": ""CNY"", ""to"": ""GBP"" }`.  

Although the argument `base` in the actual call uses ""CNY"" instead of ""RMB"", these two are semantically equivalent since RMB (Renminbi) and CNY (Chinese Yuan) refer to the same currency. Apart from this semantic variation, all required parameters are correct, and the additional tool invocation to ""Finish"" is irrelevant to evaluation for Objective 2. Thus, the outcome is a **success for Objective 2**.  

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason**: The final answer given by the model is:  
`""The current exchange rate from Chinese Yuan (CNY) to British Pound (GBP) is 1 CNY = 0.11 GBP.""`  

This final answer is derived directly from the results of the tool invocation, specifically from the `calculated` exchange rate value (`0.11`) retrieved via the tool. The response accurately fulfills the requirement of reporting the exchange rate from Chinese Yuan (CNY) to British Pound (GBP). Therefore, for Objective 3, it is a **success**.",,,,,,,
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call involves invoking `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with the argument `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `profile_for_tiktok_v3` multiple times but always with the argument `{""username"": ""jack""}` instead of the expected username `""the_beautyofcinema""`. This discrepancy in the argument causes the tool call to not fulfill the instruction. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure as the model could not progress toward fulfilling the user's requirement based on the expected API.",,,,,,,
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the following comparisons were made:  
1. **Tool Invoked**: `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `""arguments"": ""{ \""symbol\"": \""TSLA\"" }""`  
   **Expected**: `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `""arguments"": ""{ \""symbol\"": \""TSLA\"" }""`  
   - Tool name and arguments fully align.  

2. **Tool Invoked**: `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `""arguments"": ""{ \""symbol\"": \""TSLA\"" }""`  
   **Expected**: `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `""arguments"": ""{ \""symbol\"": \""TSLA\"" }""`  
   - Tool name and arguments fully align.  

3. **Tool Invoked**: `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `""arguments"": ""{ \""symbol\"": \""TSLA\"" }""`  
   **Expected**: `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `""arguments"": ""{ \""symbol\"": \""TSLA\"" }""`  
   - Tool name and arguments fully align.  

Hence, all required tools were invoked correctly, satisfying **Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided the **final answer**, and the response effectively utilized the API outputs:  
1. The P/E ratio, PEG ratio, and growth estimates details match the data retrieved from `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`.  
2. Balance sheet history aligns with data fetched by `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2`.  
3. Institution ownership data such as percentages for Vanguard and Blackrock, along with percentage changes, appropriately corresponds to the information retrieved by `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2`.  

The final answer successfully fulfills the user's instruction based on the API results, meeting **Objective 3**.",,,,,,,
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",11,Failure,Success,Success,"1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`.  
2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`.  
3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`.  

The model invoked these API calls multiple times with consistent arguments. Extra calls and additional irrelevant APIs were made, but as explicitly noted, we disregard these in evaluating the correctness of Objective 2, focusing on whether all required calls were correctly executed.

---

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final answer provided by the model integrates the information retrieved from the API responses:  
1. **Index Trend History**: Accurately sourced data on growth estimates, reflecting the `\""index-trend\""` response retrieved via the relevant tool.  
2. **Balance Sheet Data**: Noted that no data is available for the balance sheet, consistent with the `""balance-sheet""` response.  
3. **Institution Ownership Details**: The ownership details match the extracted information from the `""institution-ownership""` response.  

The final answer effectively fulfills the user's request for a detailed analysis of the company (Janover), consolidating and reporting API-provided outputs with no observable discrepancies or independent/generated content not validated by the API data.",,,,,,,
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}`.  
- The required API call is:   
  `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}`.  
- The tool name matches, and all required arguments are present and correct. The match is perfect, so it's a success for Objective 2.  

- For Objective 3, the final answer is:  
  `""Here is the index trend history for NVIDIA (NVDA): ... This information can help you analyze the stock's performance and make informed trading decisions.""`.  
  The answer uses the data retrieved from the API call, such as PE Ratio, PEG Ratio, and various growth estimates. Since the final response fulfills the user's instruction and bases the generated answer on the API data, it is a success for Objective 3.",,,,,,,
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,167,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Given that Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure since the required data using the needed API call with ?úsymbol?? ""DJR??was never obtained. The final answer about ""DIA"" is also unrelated to the true user demand (vital details of DJR).",,,,,,,
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"The expected tool call is:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{ ""symbol"": ""META"" }`  

The actual tool calls include the following:  
1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"":""FB""}`
2. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"":""META""}`  

The required tool call, `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with the correct arguments `{""symbol"":""META""}`, is found among the actual tool calls, even though there is an extra, unnecessary call with the argument `{""symbol"":""FB""}`. Extra tool calls are allowed, so this satisfies Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:**  
The model uses the response returned from the `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` tool call with the correct argument `{""symbol"":""META""}` to generate the final answer:  
> ""The index trend for the Facebook stock (META) shows the following growth estimates:

> - Current Year (0y): 0.14  
> - Next Year (+1y): 0.13  
> - Long-Term Growth (LTG): 0.08""  

The growth estimates align exactly with the data retrieved from the successful tool call. This proves the final response is based on the API's data, fulfilling the user instruction.",,,,,,,
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call is: 

`{ 'name': 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api', 'arguments': '{ ""channel"": ""shadoune666"" }' }`.  

The model invoked multiple tool calls, as follows:  
1. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `{""channel"":""shadoune kane""}`.
2. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `{""channel"":""shadoune666""}`.
3. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `{""channel"":""shadoune""}`.  

Among these tool calls, only the second one matches the required API call. However, additional unnecessary tool calls (first and third) were invoked, which deviate from the expected requirement, specifically because the required API call corresponds to ""shadoune666"" only and doesn't align with redundant or experimental calls to other channels.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. Still, evaluating the final answer independently, prescribing information about both `shadoune666` and another channel `shadoune` is indicative that unnecessary tool behavior and information retrieval doesn't completely align with user-focused need??

The actual tool call made by the model was as follows:

While the tool name in the actual tool call appears quite similar, it has a truncated form mismatch: `ohlcv...` vs `ohclv...`, making this a failure. Additionally, while the arguments make sense, the spelling inconsistency in naming (tool mismatch) directly results in the failure of Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**: Since Objective 2 failed (tool name mismatch and arguments not completely matching the expected format), we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Thus, regardless of the adequacy of the final answer provided by the model, it violates the dependency rule ??the final response cannot be trusted to have been accurately derived from intended tool calls.",,,,,,,

The **actual API calls** made by the model, despite being many in count, **failed to match the required arguments**. None of the API calls produced by the model had the exact combination of `start_date`, `end_date`, `base`, and `symbols` as required, i.e., specifically for the date range `""2022-12-01""` to `""2022-12-20""`. Without matching all required elements (`start_date`, `end_date`, `base`, `symbols`), the API calls made cannot be considered successful.  

Furthermore, additional parameters were either outside the specified range, targeted an invalid timeframe more broadly, or performed redundant split intervals attempting a solution for error handling. Despite these iterative attempts, the required conditions were not matched in even a single tool call.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since the model could not make the correct API calls for the specific required date range (`2022-12-01 to 2022-12-20`) and corresponding metals (`XAU`, `XPT`), it therefore failed to retrieve relevant data to construct an accurate final answer based on the user's instructions. No final answer fulfilling the user's query on the price data was provided, given that most tool responses conveyed **errors** due to overlong date ranges. Based on the information visible, no valid fulfillment occurred.",,,,,,,

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, it directly implies Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final response acknowledged the inability to retrieve the necessary information and suggested issues with the provided ticker symbols. The model relied on its internal logic about failing to get data but could not directly operate on data from the required tool calls because it never provided calls with the expected correct symbol, ""SYNX.""

1. **Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
   - **Required API calls:**  
     1. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments: `{ ""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"" }`

   - **Actual tool calls by the model:**  
     - Tool 1: `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments: `{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-15"", ""start_date"": ""2024-02-05"" }`.  
     - Tool 2: `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments: `{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-15"", ""start_date"": ""2024-02-05"" }`.  

   Although the model provided a broader date range (`2024-02-05` to `2024-02-15`) compared to the required range (`2024-02-10` to `2024-02-13`), the tool calls indeed include all data required, and the additional data requested does not compromise the model's correctness. Hence, **Objective 2 is considered a success.**

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
   - The final answer provided by the model summarizes both gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) rates for the time range from `2024-02-05` to `2024-02-15`. This encompasses and achieves the expected instruction, which focused particularly on trends around the 2024 Lunar New Year (`2024-02-10`) and the time window (`2024-02-10` to `2024-02-13`).  
   - The answer is shown clearly based on API call data (the actual rates retrieved). Therefore, the user's requirements are fulfilled, and **Objective 3 is a success**.",,,,,,,
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
The required API call specifies the tool `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` with the arguments `{ ""interval"":""y1"", ""is_id"":""02823"" }`. However, the actual tool call made by the model is `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` with the arguments `{ ""interval"":""y1"", ""is_id"":""HSCEI:IND"" }`. The `is_id` parameter in the actual call (""HSCEI:IND"") does not match the expected parameter (""02823""). Due to this mismatch, Objective 2 fails. According to the rules stated, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Therefore, both objectives are marked as failures.",,,,,,,
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool call is:  
- `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with the argument `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}`  

The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with the argument `{""date"": ""05-06-2024""}`  
2. `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with the argument `{""date"": ""05-05-2024""}`  
3. `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with the argument `{""date"": ""05-04-2024""}`  
4. `'latest_drawing_for_fantasy_5'` with no specific arguments provided.  
None of the arguments used in these tool calls match the required argument `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}` for `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'`. This mismatch makes **Objective 2** a failure.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2** is a failure, **Objective 3** is automatically considered a failure. Even if **Objective 2** had been successful, the user likely required information about the drawing on `01-02-2024`. The model provided the latest Fantasy 5 numbers as its final answer, which did not align with the user's request. Therefore, **Objective 3** does not meet the user's instructions.",,,,,,,
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```json
{
  ""name"": ""drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5"",
  ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""date1\"": \""12-01-2023\"",\n  \""date2\"": \""12-31-2023\""\n }""

However, the actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `{ ""name"": ""latest_10_drawings_for_fantasy_5"", ""arguments"": ""{}"" }`  
2. `{ ""name"": ""drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5"", ""arguments"": ""{\""date1\"": \""05-01-2023\"", \""date2\"": \""05-31-2023\""}"" }`  
3. `{ ""name"": ""Finish"", ""arguments"": ""{\""return_type\"": \""give_answer\"", \""final_answer\"": \""...\""}"" }`  

The ""name"" of the required tool (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`) is invoked once, but the arguments differ since the anticipated arguments have `""date1"": ""12-01-2023""` and `""date2"": ""12-31-2023""`. The model called the tool with arguments containing `""date1"": ""05-01-2023""` and `""date2"": ""05-31-2023""`, which do not align with the expected date range. This discrepancy in arguments results in a **failure for Objective 2**.

For Objective 3, since the response required the proper tool invocation with exact arguments to fulfill the user's request, and because there are mismatches in the requested time period, the final answer returned by the model is irrelevant to the context of what the user originally requested (data from December 2023). The model's final output is not based on the expected API call and retrieves misinformation, leading to **failure for Objective 3**.",,,,,,,

  ```
The actual tool calls made by the model include various API invocations that do not precisely match the required call in function arguments. For instance, the model made several calls such as:  
  - 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments:
    ```json
    {
      ""variables"": ""x,y"",
      ""values"": ""10,20"",

    {
      ""variables"": """",
      ""values"": """",
      ""expression"": ""30 + 20""
    }
    ```  

None of the tool calls directly or entirely match the required API call in terms of `expression`, where it specifically demanded do the operation on `""5+10""`. This mismatch means that Objective 2: Fails.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Objective 2 failed, which inherently ensures failure for Objective 3. The model relied on invalid/miscellaneous expression evaluations instead of reaching the final answer or fulfilling the need for calculating the specific sum of `""5 + 10""`. Additionally, the validator stalled on incorrect additional calculations like `""30+20""`, losing track of the original request. The final answer `""The total number of coins you have is 60.""` is invalid because it did not derive from the expected calculations required under Objective 2's mandated call.",,,,,,,
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2:**

     - `'user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""442536695""}`.
   - The required tool (`users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`) was **not invoked**, and the argument structure also does not match any of the given model tool calls.
   - Hence, **Objective 2 fails**.

**Objective 2**: The expected API call was as follows:  
- `{ 'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{ ""username"": ""jackie"" }' }`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with arguments:  
   `{ ""username"": ""jackiechan"" }`  

2. Additional tool calls to the same function `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with arguments containing also:  
   - `{ ""username"": ""jackiechan"", ""nextmaxid"": ""<various_ids>"" }`  
   
The key issue is that the input argument in the expected API call specifies `username` as `jackie`, while the model used `jackiechan`. Since this changes the semantic meaning to a completely different username and does not match the required argument, Objective 2 is a failure based on the evaluation rules (especially restrictions around spelling accuracy for expected parameters).  

**Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 directly fails as well. It's worth noting here that, even if the final answer reflected the API response, the root failure for not fulfilling the expected tool call invalidates the achievement of this objective.",,,,,,,

1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`.  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`.  

The tool names and the core parameter (`countryCode`/case-insensitively matches `countrycode`) are semantically equivalent, despite the capitalization difference. Other details (such as spelling of arguments) are consistent, and the required API calls were successfully invoked.  

Additional calls that were not required, such as multiple initial `'countries_for_referential_db'` attempts and `'cities_in_a_state_for_referential_db'`, do not affect the validity of the required tool calls. Hence, the objective is considered a success.

---

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:** The final answer provided aligns with the user's instruction of determining the richest country in Africa (Nigeria was appropriately identified) and retrieving its relevant details. The list of states with their latitude and longitude was derived using data obtained from the tool `states_for_referential_db`, while other country-specific information like the capital, currency, and region was informed by the responses of the `country_details_for_referential_db`. The final response utilizes and integrates data specifically retrieved from the API calls without generating fabricated information.",,,,,,,

Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",45,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`  

The **actual tool calls** invoked by the model include multiple calls to various tools like `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with the argument `{""countrycode"": ""MD""}` and `'states_for_referential_db'` with `{""countrycode"": ""MD""}`. These do not match the required tool calls because the required arguments specifically refer to `""countryCode"": ""UA""`, which is meant for Ukraine, whereas the model incorrectly fetched data for Moldova by using the argument `""countrycode"": ""MD""`. Thus, the intended data about Ukraine was not retrieved. This mismatch in country codes results in Objective 2 failing.

For Objective 3: Since the model failed Objective 2 by invoking incorrect tool calls and thereby did not retrieve data for the required country (Ukraine), its **final answer based on Moldova information does not fulfill the user's original request** to handle operations for Ukraine. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure as well.",,,,,,,

Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",38,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

### Objective 2 Analysis:
- **Expected Tool Calls:**  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}` (to fetch Malaysia's details).  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}` (to fetch Malaysia's state boundaries).  

- **Actual Tool Calls by Model:**  
  The model invoked the following **relevant tool calls**:  
  - `""country_details_for_referential_db""` with arguments related to countries such as `{""countrycode"": ""SG""}`, `""countrycode"": ""QA""`, and `""countrycode"": ""JP""`.  
  - Later, it also invoked `states_for_referential_db` using country codes like `""countrycode"": ""QA""`.  

  However, the **country specified in all these cases is not** Malaysia (`""MY""`), which was explicitly requested in the required calls. Therefore, even though the function names coincided, the inputs (arguments) failed to align with the required API calls. As a result, the API requirements set forth for assessing the specific country `""MY""` were not fulfilled.  

### Objective 3 Analysis:
For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2** already failed (the required API data for `""MY""` was not retrieved), we can conclude the response derives from **incorrect** or unrelated sources not associated with the user's direct request (Malaysia's information). The final response primarily discusses New Singapore-related sources miiran markdown case-finalization inadequ<< function_API signaturewell **",,,,,,,

1. **Objective 2**: The evaluation revealed that the required API calls (`'country_details_for_referential_db'` with argument `""countryCode"": ""IN"" and `'states_for_referential_db'` with argument `""countryCode"": ""IN""`) were not matched with any of the actual tool calls.

42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,214,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:** The expected API call was:
```json
{
  ""name"": ""search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper"",
  ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""query\"": \""restaurants, NY, USA\""\n   }""
}
```
The actual tool calls made by the model involved multiple invocations of the _search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper_ function and other tools with diverse search terms and combinations but never with the explicitly required query for ""restaurants, NY, USA"".

Additionally, due to the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 automatically fails since the model did not demonstrate the ability to appropriately utilize the API and successfully return user-desirable outcomes aligned with the expected query or parameters. The final response also lacked the requested detailed reviews specific to the expected query and regions. Hence, no correct API data utilization is observed.",,,,,,,
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,7,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:**  
   - **Required API calls:**  
     1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with `{ ""q"": ""After Everything"" }`  
     2. `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with `{ ""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything"" }`  
   - **Actual tool calls invoked by the model:**  
     1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with `{ ""q"": ""After Everything"" }`
     2. `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with `{ ""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything"" }`
   - Comparison shows that the actual tool calls align perfectly with the required API calls. The tool names and required arguments are correct, so Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3:**  
   - The model provided a final answer that listed and described two movies similar to ""After Everything (2023)"" directed by Castille Landon.  
   - The final answer was derived directly from the results of the `""find_similar_for_similar_movies""` tool (the relevant movie data was retrieved from API calls). The description and layout directly use the retrieved content without independent fabrication. Users explicitly receive the requested recommendations. Hence, Objective 3 is a success.",,,,,,,
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,26,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{""q"": ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'""}`.  

The model made the following matching tool call:    
- `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{""q"":""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""}` (tool ID: `call_0_a1313f7a-48be-4ed0-be18-f6cc928866b6`).  

Although there is a minor difference in the way the query string is formatted (single quotes vs. no quotes), the semantic meaning remains identical (""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""). This satisfies Objective 2 as outlined by the instructions.  

**For Objective 3:**  
The model's final answer lists a set of movies similar to ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,"" as retrieved using the appropriate APIs. The dataset used to generate the answer was retrieved from the corresponding call tailored to the user request (`call_0_a1313f7a-48be-4ed0-be18-f6cc928866b6`). Therefore, the final answer satisfies the user's query, achieving Objective 3. The final answer explicitly referenced movies similar to ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.""",,,,,,,
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Objective 2 is a failure; thus, Objective 3 automatically fails because the expected API data retrieval did not align with the specified requirements and the final answer was based on the incorrect input.",,,,,,,
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  

- The required API call is:  
  ```
  'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments {
    ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
    ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
    ""base"": ""USDT"",
    ""symbol"": ""BTC""
  }
  ```  

- The actual tool invoked by the model is:  
  ```
  'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments {
    ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
    ""start"": ""2023-05-01T00:00:00"",
    ""base"": ""USDT"",
    ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
    ""gran"": ""1d"",
    ""sort"": ""asc"",
    ""end"": ""2023-05-31T23:59:59"",
    ""accept"": ""application/json""
  }
  ```  

The actual tool used (`ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`) closely matches the required tool name (`OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` in intent), but there are important discrepancies with the required arguments:
1. The `start` argument in the required API is `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`, but the model used `""2023-05-01T00:00:00""`. This difference is significant and does not align with the required start time.
2. Additional parameters (like `""gran""`, `""sort""`, `""end""`, and `""accept""`) used in the tool invocation are unnecessary and change the intended granularity and scope of the request.  

Because the actual API call failed to meet the argument alignment requirements, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed. The final answer was based on data retrieved from a mismatched API call (with a different `start` argument and additional granularity settings) and overlooks the user's intended settings. As per the guidelines, any such discrepancies immediately result in a failure for Objective 3.",,,,,,,
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
2. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
3. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
2. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
3. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  

Analysis:  
The tool name `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` matches, despite minor casing differences (`Differentiate_for...`). The arguments for all tool calls are accurate and match the required ones. No details were incorrect or conflicting. Hence, Objective 2 is **successfully achieved**.  

---

For Objective 3:  
The model provided a final answer based on deriving valid results from tool responses. Its summary of the derivatives precisely confirmed:  
1. First Derivative as `15x^4 + 8x^3`  
2. Second Derivative as `60x^3 + 24x^2`  
3. Third Derivative as `180x^2 + 48x`  

All derivatives align well with the tool responses:  
- After interpreting `3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1`, the first API call gives `15*x^4 + 8*x^3`.  
- The second call processes this and outputs `60*x^3 + 24*x^2`.  
- The third call continues and produces `48*x + 180*x^2`.  

The final answer succinctly compiles these in a correct mathematical representation, relying only on computed API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is also **successfully achieved**.",,,,,,,
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API calls and the actual tool calls match in all required details:  
  1. Required API call: `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'expression': '3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1', 'variable': 'a'`.  
     Actual tool call: `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`. The spelling of variable names and the API name (despite enhanced lowercase naming) remains aligned.  
  2. Required API call: `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'expression': '5*b^3 + 4*b^2 Bachelor",,,,,,,
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required API call was:  
- Tool name: `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'`  
  - Arguments: `{""city"": ""London""}`

The actual tools invoked by the model were:  
1. `'list_of_all_countries_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` - No similarity to the expected tool name or relevance to the provided required arguments.  
2. `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` - However, no arguments were given in the model's tool call; hence the required argument (`{""city"": ""London""}`) is missing, making this tool call incorrect.  
3. Other irrelevant tools such as `'list_of_cities_in_one_country_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` and `'get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days'`, among others, which were not required.

Since the required tool call was not made correctly, the model fails Objective 2. Furthermore, as per the given rules, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 must also fail because the final answer relies on the data retrieved from API calls, none of which fulfilled the user's request for `""London""`. Therefore, the user's instruction was not achieved.",,,,,,,
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
Regarding **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
`{'name': 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{ ""username"": ""KingJames"" }'}`  

The model invoked:  
1. `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `'{""username"":""james""}'`  

The tool name is correct (`user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2`), but the argument `""username"": ""james""` does not match the required argument `""username"": ""KingJames""`. These are two different handles, so **the tool call is not accurate**. Additionally, the model made unnecessary calls (`user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2` and `Finish`) which are irrelevant to the expected API calls.  
  
Given that **Objective 2** is a failure, we can **directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure**. Although the final answer was provided, it was derived from a wrong argument, thus making the entire response invalid for executing the user's instruction accurately.",,,,,,,
