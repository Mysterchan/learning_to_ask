1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The model invoked the following tool call:  
  `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`.  
  The required API call was:  
  `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{ ""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31"" }`.  
  Although the format of the dates (""12-01-2023"" vs. ""2023-12-01"") differs, they have the same semantic meaning. The tool name and arguments align with the required API call. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  
  
- **Objective 3**:  
  The final answer provided by the model accurately summarizes the Fantasy 5 winning number sets from December 1 to December 31, 2023, based on the data retrieved from the `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` tool that contained detailed drawing information. The response meets the user's instruction to provide winning number sets for the specified time period, using data directly fetched from the API. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
```json
{'name': 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{ ""date"": ""2022-07-20"" }'}
```
The model actually invoked the following tool:  
```json
{'name': 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'}
```
The tool name and the argument closely align. The argument ""date"" was correctly provided as ""2022-07-20"". Since the tool call perfectly matches the requirement, it is a success for Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**, the final answer generated by the model was:  
```  
""Here is the Hot 100 chart information for July 20, 2022:  
1. 'As It Was' by Harry Styles  
2. 'About Damn Time' by Lizzo  
3. 'First Class' by Jack Harlow  
4. 'Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)' by Kate Bush  
5. 'Wait for U' by Future featuring Drake and Tems  
6. 'Late Night Talking' by Harry Styles  
7. 'Me Porto Bonito' by Bad Bunny featuring Chencho Corleone  
8. 'Jimmy Cooks' by Drake featuring 21 Savage  
9. 'Glimpse of Us' by Joji  
10. 'Big Energy' by Latto  
For the complete list, please visit the Billboard website.""  
```
The user requested the Hot 100 chart information for a specific date (""2022-07-20""), and the response used the retrieved data from the API call to provide specific and relevant details directly aligned with the user's instruction. The information presented was not fabricated but derived directly from the API results. Therefore, the model effectively achieved the user's request, making it a success for Objective 3."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
Upon evaluation of Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'billboard_200_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""2020-03-18""\n  }'}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`  
2. Two additional API calls `hot_100_for_billboard` and `artist_100_for_billboard` were also invoked, which are unnecessary but do not affect the evaluation.  

Comparison: The required API call `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with argument `""date"": ""2020-03-18""` matches precisely with the corresponding tool call executed by the model. Additionally, unnecessary function calls are permissible and do not affect success. Thus, Objective 2 is successful.  

Upon evaluation of Objective 3:  
The user's requirement was to provide an overview of the top music charts, specifically from the Billboard charts on the date provided. The final answer states:  
?ùHere are the top music charts from Billboard on March 18, 2020:  
- **Hot 100 Chart**, **Artist 100 Chart**, and **Billboard 200 Chart** ??containing rankings and additional useful details.?? 

This information aligns with and is derived directly from the API responses visible in the `""response""` content of the tool calls. The model used the retrieved data effectively to construct the answer, ensuring the requirements were fulfilled. Thus, Objective 3 is successful."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,6,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
- `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'` with arguments `'{}'`

The tool invoked by the model:  
- `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'` with arguments `'{}'`

The tool name and arguments match the required call. Even though there are multiple invocations of the required tool by the model (which is unnecessary but doesn't make it incorrect according to the instructions), all required invocations are fulfilled, making it a success for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
The model provided the final answer: `""Here is a success quote to start your day: 'Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm. -Winston Churchill'""` through the last tool call `Finish` which contains the derived quote directly from the API responses. Hence, the response achieves the user's instructions and is derived from the data retrieved via API calls, making it a success for Objective 3."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,5,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked two tools:  
1. **Tool Name:** `getcountrycode_for_asktheworld` with no meaningful arguments (`arguments: '{}')`.  
2. **Tool Name:** `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {""keyword"": ""final year project"", ""countrycode"": ""US"", ""multiplequestions"": true}
   ```

However, the expected API call was:  
**Tool Name:** `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""keyword"": ""technology"",
  ""countryCode"": ""us""
}
```

Reasons for failure:  
- The arguments for `keyword` in the tool call (`""final year project""`) did not match the expected one (`""technology""`).  
- There is a case mismatch in `countryCode` (expected: `countryCode`, actual: `countrycode`), but this issue is insignificant compared to the mismatch in `keyword`.  
- Unnecessary invocation of an unrelated tool (`getcountrycode_for_asktheworld`) does not count toward satisfying Objective 2, as it was not in the expected API tool calls list.

Thus, Objective 2 is a failure because the actual tool calls either had mismatched arguments or invoked unrelated tools.

**Objective 3:**  
Since the model was unable to successfully retrieve relevant information due to the incorrect API call arguments in Objective 2, it directly affects Objective 3. At the end, the model responded with,  
""Due to the limitation of the toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" which clearly indicates it failed to fulfill the user's instruction. This failure confirms that Objective 3 was not achieved."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The tool invoked by the model is:  
- `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Node.js Developer""}`

The required API call is:  
- `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`

The tool name matches perfectly, and the arguments carry the same semantic meaning, even though there is minor variation in format (`nodejs developer` vs `Node.js Developer`). Since these differences are purely case-related or due to formatting and don't alter the intent of the call, it meets the conditions for success in Objective 2.

---

For Objective 3:  
The final response provided by the model is:  
- `""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""`

While the tool provided a valid response (`status`: ""OK"" and detailed parameters such as the job title, location, etc.), the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction of providing an accurate salary estimate. Instead, the model stated an inability to solve the question, despite data indicating potential satisfaction of the user's inquiry. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }'}`  

  The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Nodejs developer""}'`.  

  The tool name matches (`estimated_salary_for_jsearch`), and the arguments provided (`location=""New York""` and `job_title=""Nodejs developer""`) are consistent with the required arguments. The capitalization of the job title argument (`Nodejs developer` vs. `nodejs developer`) is ignored as it does not affect the meaning. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.

- **Objective 3**:  
  The final answer provided by the model is:  
  `""The estimated salary for a Node.js Developer in New York ranges from $111,318.77 to $184,818.82 per year, with a median salary of $142,347.59 per year. This information is based on data from Glassdoor.""`  

  The answer is based on the data found in the API response:  
  ```json
  {
    ""location"": ""New York City, NY"",
    ""job_title"": ""Nodejs Developer"",
    ""min_salary"": 111318.77,
    ""max_salary"": 184818.82,
    ""median_salary"": 142347.59,
    ""salary_period"": ""YEAR""
  }
  ```  

  The key information in the final answer (salary range, median salary, and job field) directly reflects the data from the tool's response. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
1. For **Objective 2**, the actual tool call made by the model matches the required API call.  
   - **Actual tool call (invoked by the model):**  
     `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `'{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}'`  
   - **Expected tool call (required):**  
     `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `'{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }'`  
   The tool name and argument (`username`) are accurate and follow the expected structure. Semantic equivalence is upheld, and this satisfies Objective 2.

2. For **Objective 3**, the model successfully utilized the data retrieved from the `profile_for_tiktok_v3` API to construct the user's requested response.  
   - The final answer correctly includes the profile information of the TikTok username *`the_beautyofcinema`*. It reflects the retrieved **profile details**, such as the ID, nickname, username, and avatar links provided in the dataset from the `profile_for_tiktok_v3` API.  
   - Furthermore, the model accurately acknowledges its inability to retrieve video information and clearly states the limitations while providing valid results for the available data.
   - Agreement between extracted API response and provided final answer ensures that Objective 3 is successfully fulfilled."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required API call does not match the tool call invoked by the model.  
- **Required API Call**: 'video_details_for_tiktok_api' with arguments '{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}'.  
- **Tool Called by the Model**: 'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api' with arguments '{""username"":""7097255034731138310""}'.  

The tool name used by the model ('user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api') is different from the required ('video_details_for_tiktok_api'), and the arguments also differ conceptually. Therefore, the model did not execute the correct tool, making Objective 2 a failure. As a result, per the evaluation guidelines, Objective 3 is also considered a failure since the correct API call was not fulfilled. Additionally, the final instruction could not have been achieved without utilizing the proper API call."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,7,0,Success,Success,Failure,"- The expected API call is:  
  `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""}'`.  
- The actual tool invoked by the model multiple times is:  
  `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}'`.  
  The minor formatting difference (space after the comma in the expected arguments) does not alter the semantic correctness of the tool call. Hence it matches the required API call.  
- Since all required API calls are performed (irrespective of repeated calls), this is a SUCCESS for Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
- There is no `final_answer` (`return_type: ""give_answer""`) provided by the model to fulfill the user's instruction.  
- While multiple tool calls were performed and the responses received contained profile data for the provided Twitter user IDs, the final answer was never presented based on this data.  
- Thus, the user?ôs instruction to fetch Twitter profiles and return profile details remains unfulfilled."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls demanded invoking `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}`. The model correctly invoked this tool with the same name (`'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'`) and the correct argument `{""username"":""yousuck2020""}`. However, the model also unnecessarily invoked a second tool, `'user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2'`, which was not specified in the expected API calls. Out of alignment with the rule that unnecessary tools influence success only when they do not entirely align with context, this unnecessary behavior constitutes failure in meeting Objective 2."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

### Objective 2:
The model invoked the following tool call:  
**Invoked Tool(s):**  
- `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `'{""q"":""top beach vacation destinations 2023"",""num"":5}'`.  

**Required Tool(s):**  
- `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments containing `{""q"": ""Hawaii""}`.  
- `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments containing `{""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""}`.  

**Comparison:**  
1. The invoked tool `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"":""top beach vacation destinations 2023"",""num"":5}` does not correspond to either of the required calls. It asks for ""top beach vacation destinations 2023"", which is fundamentally different from ""weather forecast in Hawaii"". Hence, the semantic meaning differs.  

2. The model failed to invoke the tool `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with any arguments, meaning this required tool call was not performed at all.  

Without executing the correct tools with the necessary arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.  

### Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 already failed, it implies that the model did not rely on the correct API calls. Furthermore:  
1. The model?ôs final response, **""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""**, does not fulfill the user's original request, which was retrieving weather forecasts and images of specific beach destinations.  
2. The response was not based on data retrieved through a sequence of valid tool calls aligned with the expectations.  

Hence, Objective 3 is a failure as well."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The expected tool call was:  
*Tool name:* `search_for_g_search`

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  

1. *Tool name:* `location_for_g_search`

14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  - **Expected Tool Calls**:  
    `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
      ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""
    }
    ```
  - **Actual Tool Calls**:  
    `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
      ""trackingnumber"": ""NY323068998GB""
    }
    ```  
    The tool name matches exactly. The argument `""trackingnumber""` in the actual call is semantically equivalent to the expected `""trackingNumber""`, both holding the correct value of `""NY323068998GB""`. Following Rule 3, this close equivalence is acceptable. Additional tool calls that were not required do not affect the outcome; hence Objective 2 is a success.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The assistant attempted successive tool calls to achieve the user's instruction; however, it encountered errors (e.g., timeouts), leading it to give up and terminate processing without producing a valid final answer. Since no final answer was provided to fulfill the user's request, Objective 3 fails."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
The required API call is:  
- `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{ ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB"" }`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model:  
1. **`'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'`** with arguments `{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}`.  

While the tool name is correct, the spelling inconsistency in the argument name (`'trackingNumber'` in the required call but `'trackingnumber'` in the actual call) means this case fails objective 1. According to the evaluation guidelines, spelling issues are not allowed. Hence, Objective 2 is deemed a failure.  

For **Objective 3**:  
Since objective 1 fails, Objective 3 can directly be marked as a failure. Even though the model provides an answer stating that the package is associated with carriers ""Royal Mail"" and ""UBI,"" its failure to correctly perform the required API call invalidates the final response."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the ""followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro"" tool was invoked multiple times by the model's API calls with appropriate arguments. Specifically, the required API call was:

17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"```python
{'name': 'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""\n  }'}
```
The tool name and all required arguments are correct, leading to a successful evaluation for Objective 2.

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final answer provided by the model fulfilled the user's instruction by listing the details of the rental property at the given address based on the data retrieved from the API calls. Specifically, the model used the result from the `'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2'` API call and presented information such as rent Zestimate, rent range, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and photos via the `'photos_for_zillow_v2'`. It structured the response properly and included a link to further explore comparable properties and market trends. This response achieved the user's requirement, showing dependency on the API retrieval, without any apparent fabrication."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
`'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` with arguments:  
```json  
{  
  ""search_within_x_miles"": 50,  
  ""location"": ""12750""  
}  
```  

- The tools invoked by the model include:  
`'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` with arguments:  
```json  
{  
  ""search_within_x_miles"": 50,  
  ""location"": ""12750""  
}  
```  

The tool invoked matches the required API call with no discrepancies in tool name or required parameters. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model provides a final answer:  
```  
""I found several rental properties within 50 miles of the location with postal code 12750. Here are some details:  

1. **Property Type**: Single Family  
   - **Beds**: 4

   - **Square Feet**: 1,312  
   - **List Price**: $1,600

   - **Contact**: Keller Williams RE Rt 6, Phone: 570-470-8294  

You can contact the listed office for more details or to schedule a viewing.  
```  

This final answer effectively fulfills the user's request for rental property details near the specified location. It is also based on the data retrieved via the expected `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` API call, whose response explicitly provided similar details (e.g., property type, price, broker contact).  

Since the user's request is precisely satisfied using accurate API data, Objective 3 is a success."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the name of the API called by the model (`realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data`) matches the required API call. Furthermore, the required parameters (`city: ""San Jose"", state_code: ""CA"", offset: ""0""`) are correctly included in the actual tool call made by the model. The model also invokes multiple other unnecessary offset increments that are not specified in the required API, but these additional calls do not affect the correctness per evaluation criteria ??all required elements are met. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model does not provide the final answer in the `""role"": ""assistant""` entries (they mention upcoming steps or process, but there is no consolidated or clear final completion for ""buy property"" listings). Since no completed information is presented to fulfill the initial user query, Objective 3 is a failure."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,5,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- According to the provided actual tool calls taken by the model, the model repeatedly called the `'time_zones_for_geodb_cities'` API multiple times with an empty argument `{}`.  
- The required API call is `'time_zone_for_geodb_cities'` with the argument `'{\n  ""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""\n  }'`.  
- The actual tool calls completely miss the required `zoneid` argument and do not pass the correct intent demanded.
  
As Objective 2 failed due to incorrect and irrelevant API tool calls, Objective 3 automatically fails since the correct information for the user's instruction could not have been retrieved, leaving the requested instruction unmet."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  

```
{'name': 'country_details_for_referential_db', 'arguments': '{\n  ""countryCode"": ""DE""\n  }'}

The tools invoked by the model are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""DE""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""DE""}`  

While the tool name `country_details_for_referential_db` is correct in the first tool call, the argument name for the required field (`countryCode`) does not match exactly??the actual API call uses `countrycode`, which differs from the required `countryCode`. This issue violates the guidelines (spelling and case differences are treated as failures), resulting in Objective 2 being a failure.  

As per the rules, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails automatically."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:** The tools invoked by the model and the given required API calls are as follows:  
- **Model Invoked Calls (Actual Tool Calls):**  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`.  
  2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`.  

- **Required API Calls:**  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{\n  ""countryCode"": ""QA""\n  }`.  
  2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{\n  ""countryCode"": ""QA""\n  }`.

Both required tools (`country_details_for_referential_db`, `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db`) were invoked with semantically identical arguments. The slight formatting differences (`countrycode` versus `countryCode`) are insignificant and clearly identify the same argument. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:** The model provided a complete and final answer based on the data retrieved from both API calls. This final answer includes information about Qatar's currency, phone code, and a list of cities with their latitude and longitude, which are present in the respective API responses:  
- From the first tool (`country_details_for_referential_db`), the model retrieved Qatar's currency (`Qatari riyal`) and phone code (`+974`).  
- From the second tool (`cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db`), the list of cities along with their latitude and longitude (e.g., `Al Ghuwayrƒ´yah - Latitude: 25.82882000, Longitude: 51.24567000`) was derived.  

The model synthesized this information accurately in its final answer to fulfill the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2:**  
Actual Tool Calls:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}`  

Expected API Calls:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  

Evaluation:  
The tool names in the actual calls match the required tool names. The argument names, though slightly deviated in case (`""countrycode""` vs `""countryCode""`), are still semantically identical to their intended purpose, which allows us to consider these matches a success. No major differences that affect the correctness of the calls were found. Thus, Objective 2 is **successful**.  

**For Objective 3:**  
The final answer is `""The country you are planning to visit is Japan. Here are the details:...""`, which includes the information retrieved from the `country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db` tool responses. The provided details ??such as the capital (`Tokyo`) and the list of states/prefectures with latitude and longitude ??are directly derived from the retrieved API data, confirming that the final output aligns with user instruction and is based on the API data retrieved. Thus, Objective 3 is also **successful**."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The tool invoked by the model was `'get_photos_for_realtor_search'` with arguments `'{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}'`.  
The required API call was `'get_photos_for_realtor_search'` with arguments `{ ""property_id"": ""2215556385"" }`.  
Both the tool name and the argument provided by the model match the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:  
The model provided a final response: `""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question. The property ID provided is not available in the database.""`  
This response indicates that the model did not retrieve a valid response via the invoked API. Hence, the user's instruction to retrieve the photo cannot be fulfilled. Additionally, the final reason given does not effectively fulfill the user's expectation.  
Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"```json
{
  ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""
}
```  
However, the model's actual tool calls are different:
1. The first tool call made by the model is:  
   * `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {
      ""query"": ""intimate dining"",
      ""fields"": ""name,rating,reviews"",
      ""limit"": 5
   }
   ```
2. The second tool call uses the same function again but with a different query:  
   ```json
   {
      ""query"": ""romantic dining"",
      ""fields"": ""name,rating,reviews"",
      ""limit"": 5
   }
   ```
3. Other calls made involve `get_places_reviews_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper`, but this function is **not part of the required API calls**.

The provided tool calls do not match the required query `""restaurants, NY, USA""`. Therefore, **Objective 2 fails**.

### Objective 3: Failure  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that **Objective 3 also fails**.  
The mismatch in API calls means that the provided final answer cannot possibly fulfill the user's query. Additionally, a ""final answer"" (indicative of `give_answer`) isn't present in the trace.

**Reason:** 
- The model was expected to query ""restaurants, NY, USA"" using `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper`. Instead, it searched for ""intimate dining"" and ""romantic dining"", deviating from the required API call and thus failing Objective 2.  
- Objective 3 automatically fails, as no final answer was provided, and no clear association exists between the tool invocation and the user's actual query requirement."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For **Objective 2**, the expected API calls are `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}` and `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with `{""petId"": ""1""}`. Looking at the actual tool calls made by the model:  
1. The model invoked `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`. This matches the expected API call.  
2. The model invoked `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with `{""petid"": ""1""}`. However, the actual and expected argument keys mismatch (`""petid""` instead of `""petId""`). This argument key does not align with case sensitivity (mismatch of capitalization), which leads to a **failure for Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2** is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Thus, the final answer of the model (""You have successfully... logged out of your account."") does not meet the required criteria."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
- **Required Tool Call**:  
  `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""id"": ""81040344""}`  

- **Actual Tool Calls by the Model**:  
  1. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"":""81040344""}` (first invocation).
  2. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"":""81040344""}` (third invocation).  

Although the invoked tool name matches the required one, the argument `{""is_id"":""81040344""}` does not strictly match the required argument `{""id"": ""81040344""}`. The difference in the argument name (`id` vs. `is_id`) makes the model's invocation incorrect. This semantics or spelling mismatch causes **Objective 2** to fail.  

**Objective 3**:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as the user's instruction cannot be fulfilled correctly due to incorrect tool usage."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
1. For *Objective 2*, let's compare the expected API call and those made by the model:  
   - **Expected API call**: `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003"" }`.  
   - **Actual API call** by the model: `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""is_id"": ""nm1508003"" }`.  
   
   Although the tool name matches, the argument key `{ ""id"" }` differs in the actual tool call `{ ""is_id"" }`, which invalidates the tool call. Per our evaluation criteria, semantic uses should align exactly for argument keys. Thus, *Objective 2* is a failure.  

2. Since *Objective 2* is a failure, we can directly infer that *Objective 3* also fails."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",6,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is as follows:  
- `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model include only the following:  
1. `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{""month"":7,""day"":1}`  
2. `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{""month"":7,""day"":2}`

None of the API calls match the required tool call for `{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}`. Therefore, the Objective 2 criteria are not met.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the final answer did not fulfill the user's request for the list of actors and actresses born on the 27th of July. Hence, Objective 3 also fails."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:  
The tool invoked by the model is:  
`actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `'{ ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003"", ""category"": ""actor"" }'`.  

The expected API call is:  
`actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `'{ ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003"" }'`.  

The tool name matches, and all required arguments from the expected API call (`""tconst"": ""tt0092455""`, `""nconst"": ""nm1508003""`) are provided. The additional key `""category"": ""actor""` does not affect the correctness of the tool call, as per the guidelines. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model's response notes that it cannot solve the question due to limitations in its toolset. Additionally, the response does not fulfill the required instruction, as no meaningful result was derived from the API call, and no final answer was provided to the user. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with argument `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`. However, the actual tool invoked by the model was `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with argument `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`. The tool name and function mismatch, as the model called a tool to retrieve earnings information instead of the stock index trend as required. Due to this mismatch, Objective 2 is not fulfilled. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure, as the API call does not align with the user's instruction implied by the required API, and the final answer provided is irrelevant to the intended purpose."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- For Objective 2:  
    1. **Model Tools Invoked**:  
       - `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}`  
      
    2. **Expected Tool Call**:  
       - `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}`  
  
    The tool name and arguments exactly match between the required tool call and the model-invoked tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

- For Objective 3:  
  1. The tool call to `exchange_for_currency_v2` returned a response providing the exchange rate data. This response was used by the model to calculate the final exchange rate information (`The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is 0.97. This means that 1 USD is equivalent to 0.97 EUR.`).  
  2. The final answer in `""give_answer""` is consistent with the retrieved data and fulfills the user's instruction to provide the exchange rate from USD to EUR.  
   
Therefore, the final answer is derived accurately based on the API data and fulfills the user?ôs request. Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
**Objective 2:**  
- The required tool call was:  
  `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments `'{\n  ""Symbol"": ""TSLA""\n }'`.  
- The model made two calls to `'symbol_for_stock_data'` using the argument `'{""symbol"":""TSLA""}'`.  
- Despite the argument's key being in lowercase, `""symbol"": ""TSLA""` and `""Symbol"": ""TSLA""` convey the same semantic meaning (case-insensitive for key names in JSON-based arguments is acceptable), and `TSLA` matches precisely.
- As the required API call was invoked correctly, we consider this as a **Success** for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
- The final response provided is: `""Here are the stock details for Tesla (TSLA):\n- P/E Ratio: 116.84\n- EPS (ttm): 3.65\n- Market Cap: 1369.09B\n- Sales: 97.15B\n- Gross Margin: 18.23%\n- Employees: Information not provided in the data\n- Target Price: Information not provided in the data""`.  
- This response aligns with the information obtained from the `'symbol_for_stock_data'` tool calls.  
- The specific details contained in the final response (P/E Ratio, EPS, Market Cap, etc.) match what was retrieved by the tool. Hence, the final instruction was properly achieved based on the tool data.  
- This makes Objective 3 a **Success**."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**For Objective 2**:  
The model invoked one tool: `ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with the arguments:  
```json
{
  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
  ""base"": ""USDT"",
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""gran"": ""1d"",
  ""sort"": ""asc""
}
```
The required tool call specifies:
```json
{
  ""name"": ""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
    ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
    ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
    ""base"": ""USDT""
  }
}
```
The tool name matches perfectly. All required arguments (`symbol`, `market_venue`, `start`, `base`) are correct and align as per the required tool call. The additional arguments (`gran` and `sort`) included in the actual tool call do not change the correctness of the tool's functionality. Hence, this satisfies Objective 2.

**For Objective 3**:  
The final answer provides the requested cryptocurrency metrics for BTC/USDT futures on BINANCE from the start time of `2023-05-05T10:05:00` as specified in the user's instruction. The final response is as follows:  
```
1. 2023-05-05 00:00:00: Open: 29099.6, High: 40722.15, Low: 5355.24, Close: 29491.5, Volume: 387732.8280000001, Trades: 3555599, VWAP: 29322.62

This data was directly drawn from the API response as shown during the tool invocation. Therefore, the user's request has been fulfilled entirely based on the API results, making Objective 3 a success."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2: The required API call is `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  The invoked tool does not match the required tool in terms of name or arguments. Thus, Objective 2 fails.  

2. For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 fails, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Moreover, the final response indicates that the model ""chose to give up and restart"" and no final answer was provided for the user's instruction. This confirms the failure of Objective 3."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- Tool name: `recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates`  
- Arguments: `{'is_from': 'EUR', 'to': 'JPY'}`  

The actual API calls made by the model also invoke the same tool name, but the **required arguments** (`is_from` and `to`) were completely **missing** in the actual calls as only `{}` (an empty JSON object) was passed as the arguments. This deviation in argument structure leads to failure in meeting Objective 2, even though the tool name matches.  

Objective 3: Failure    
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is considered a failure by direct inference, as proper information could not have been retrieved to generate a reliable final response. Furthermore, there isn't a section indicating the presence of a proper `give_answer` response, confirming the lack of final fulfillment of the user's request."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"1. `'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` with arguments `{""country"":""Philippines""}`.  

The expected API call is:  
1. `'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` with arguments `{""country"":""Philippines""}`.  

Although the names of the API tool are not identical (`'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` vs. `'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'`), the differences appear to be superficial, as both calls aim to query dive sites by country. The argument `""country"":""Philippines""` matches exactly in name and purpose. Based on the guidance, where similar semantic meaning or small renaming differences in tool names are still accepted as long as the arguments and intent are equivalent, this satisfies the requirement.  

**Objective 3: Success**  
The final response is derived from the data retrieved by the API call. The answer lists specific dive sites??""Garden Eel Plaza,"" ""The Cave Cathedral,"" ""Okikawa Maru,"" and ""Japanese Ship Wreck""?îand their locations in the Philippines, as provided in the tool's response. This answer directly fulfills the user's request for a list of dive sites, including their names and regions for scuba diving in the Philippines. Thus, the final answer correctly utilizes the data retrieved from the API to achieve the user's instruction."

  The model invoked the following tool calls:  
  1. `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments: `{""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"", ""country"": ""it"", ""maxitems"": 5}`.  
  2. `'auto_complete_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments: `{""prefix"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"", ""country"": ""it""}`.  

  The tool call to `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` misses the required argument `""locationName""` and includes irrelevant arguments like `""country""` and `""maxitems""`. Therefore, the tool call does not satisfy the expected format for the required API call. Additionally, invoking another tool (`'auto_complete_for_idealista_v2'`) is extraneous and not relevant to the required API calls. Thus, **Objective 2 fails**.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 failed and the required API call was not executed correctly, the final answer could not be based on the expected results from the required API call. Additionally, the model admitted its inability to resolve the user query:  
  `""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question...""`.  
  As the required user instruction is not fulfilled, **Objective 3 fails**."

However, the actual tool call involves a different tool: `'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with the arguments `'{""is_id"": 985, ""domain"": ""com""}'`.  
Though there are semantic overlaps, the discrepancy in tool name (`club_profile_for_transfermarket` vs `clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket`) and the argument key (`id` vs `is_id`) means the tool call made by the model does not match the required API. Consequently, **Objective 2** fails due to incorrect tool and arguments.

As **Objective 2** is a failure, **Objective 3** is also a failure by default, further supported by the inability to validate the correctness of the final output based on API compliance."

The tool name (`hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider`) and required arguments (`domain`, `locale`, `hotel_id`) match exactly. Additionally, while details like `hotel_id` in integer form are semantically congruent to the required string value, the tool call intention aligns fully.

For Objective 3, the final answer was not provided by the model. It encountered an issue with the locale (""es_ar"") and then gave up by making an unnecessary `Finish` API call. Since no final answer fulfilling the user request was produced, this objective is marked as a failure."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{""passport"": ""United States"", ""destination"": ""Europe""}`. However, the required API calls expected arguments with a specific `passport` value of `""US""` and `destination` values of `""FR""`, `""IT""`, and `""ES""`. The invoked tool's `passport` argument (`""United States""`) does not match the required `passport` argument (`""US""`), and the invoked `destination` argument (`""Europe""`) is not specific to the required destinations (`""FR""`, `""IT""`, `""ES""`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a **failure**. Additionally, the model's final response does not fulfill the user?ôs instruction, as it was unable to provide visa requirement information due to incorrect tool invocation and arguments, and resorted to simply stating the tool's limitation."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer the failure for Objective 3 as well. Without correctly invoking the required API call, the model's derived response cannot fulfill the user's instruction properly. Therefore, the final response ""The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is 0.91247. Converting 1000 USD to EUR gives you 912.47 EUR."" does not align with the required operation (JPY to EUR exchange), making it fail to fulfill the instruction."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model did not invoke the expected tool: `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with arguments `{""city"": ""London""}`. Instead, it invoked `get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with arguments `{""lat"": 51, ""lon"": 0, ""lang"": ""en""}`. This is a different tool altogether and does not align with the expected tool, leading to failure.  
For Objective 3, as the completion of the user's instruction depends on successful API calls (Objective 2), and the model failed to invoke the required tool, it consequently did not accomplish the user's request. Moreover, the response explicitly states, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" confirming failure for Objective 3."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"`'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""base"": ""USD"",
  ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"",
  ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"",
  ""symbols"": ""XAU""
}
```  
The actual tool call made by the model is:  
`'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""base"": ""USD"",
  ""symbols"": ""XAU"",
  ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"",
  ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20""
}
```  
The tool names match, as do all required arguments. Even though the order of parameters differs, this has no impact on the evaluation. Therefore, it's a success.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final answer was:  
```
Here are the daily historical rates of gold (XAU) in USD from 2022-12-20 to 2023-01-10:
- 2022-12-20: 0.00055948633874576
- 2022-12-21: 0.00055019594328591
...
- 2023-01-10: 0.00054054054054054
```  
The content of the final answer corresponds directly to the response data retrieved from the API call, verifying the historical rates of gold (XAU) in USD for every relevant day within the specified date range. The user?ôs instruction was fulfilled appropriately, based on the tool response."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
1. Tools invoked by the model:  
   - `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }`.  
    
   Required API call:  
   - `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }`.  
    
   Comparison: The tool name and arguments exactly match the required API call. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

2. Final Answer: The model generated the final answer based on the API data: `""There were no football matches on the specified date, 15th January 2024.""`.   
   The answer is accurate based on the tool response `{ ""error"": """", ""response"": ""{}"" }`, which indicates no match results were available for the specified date.  
   Objective 3 is satisfied as the user's instruction was correctly achieved using the API call data."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  
- For Objective 2:  
  - **Expected Tool Call**: `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'`.  
  - **Actual Tool Call**: `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'`.    
    The tool name and the required arguments match perfectly, meaning the model invoked the correct tool with the expected parameters.  

- For Objective 3:  
  - The model provided the final answer as:  
    `""The derivative of the expression 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4*x.""`.  
  - The correctness of this final answer was derived explicitly from the tool's response:  
    `""response"": ""4*x""`, successfully fulfilling the user's requirement. The response was based on the API output, and there is no evidence of fabrication. 

Therefore, both objectives were successfully met."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,5,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2: The model correctly invoked the required API call `'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'` with arguments `{""ticker"":""TSLA"",""sdate"":""2020-01-01"",""edate"":""2020-12-31""}`, which matches the required API call exactly. It is equivalent to the required API `'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'` with `{""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}`, confirming a success for Objective 2.    

2. For Objective 3: The model acknowledged the failure of the tool to fetch data due to an unauthorized error and informed the user accurately: ""The tool is unable to fetch the historical data for Tesla (TSLA) from Yahoo Finance due to an unauthorized error. Please try using a different tool or service to obtain the historical data."" The response aligns with the limitation of the tool and reflects the result of the API call appropriately. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
