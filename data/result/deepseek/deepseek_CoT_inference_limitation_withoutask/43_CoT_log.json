Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.squake: SQUAKE helps businesses to build sustainable products! With the most performant API in the market, we help travel, mobility, and logistics companies calculate carbon emissions and purchase certified climate contributions in real-time. Implemented within mins!\n"

    "content": "To determine how many people are currently watching a show with a specific title ID, we typically need access to a database or API that tracks real-time viewership data. However, based on the tools provided (`squake`), it seems that the available functions (`checkhealth_for_squake` and `projects_for_squake`) are related to carbon emissions and sustainability projects, not real-time viewership data.\n\nGiven this, I need to assess whether the available tools can be used to indirectly gather this information. Since the tools are related to sustainability and carbon emissions, it is unlikely that they can provide real-time viewership data.\n\nTherefore, I will check the health of the `squake` tool to ensure it is operational, and then explore the projects available to see if any of them might have relevant data.\n\nFirst, I will check the health of the `squake` tool.",
