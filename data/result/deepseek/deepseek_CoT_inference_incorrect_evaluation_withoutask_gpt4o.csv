1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are:  
1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `'{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  
2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `'{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `'{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}'`.  
2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `'{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}'`.  

The arguments in the actual tool calls do not match the required arguments. Specifically, the ""trackingnumber"" is `""YT9999999999""`, while the required ""trackingNumber"" is `""YT2003521266065328""`. This means the required arguments were not correctly supplied in both API calls, resulting in failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically marked as a failure. Moreover, the final answer provided (`""The tracking number YT9999999999 is associated with the carriers Aramex Australia (fastway-au) and Fastway Ireland (fastway-ie). However, no tracking information was found for this tracking number.""`) is based on incorrect inputs (`YT9999999999` being the argument used instead of the correct tracking number). Therefore, the model did not fulfill the user's instruction and the final answer is invalid."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  

For objective 1:  
Actual tool calls made by the model:  
1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}'`.  
2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}'`.

Expected tool calls:  
1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  
2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'`.

Since the `trackingnumber` value used in the actual tool calls (`'NY9999999990'`) does not match the required tracking number (`'YT2003521266065328'`), the objective 1 criteria are not met. The arguments differ, leading to a failure in executing the intended API call.  

For objective 2:  
The model does not provide a meaningful final answer based on the user's instruction or the invoked API responses. Instead, the invocation of the `Finish` tool with arguments `'{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}'` signifies that the model decided to restart without fulfilling the user's request. Furthermore, as objective 1 is already a failure, we directly infer that the model fails objective 2 as well."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  
2. `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  

However, the expected API calls were:  
1. `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
2. `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

The tool names in the actual and expected API calls are close in spelling, so on this aspect, they align; however, the argument `is_id` provided in the model's calls (`1053012309`) does not match the corresponding required `is_id` (`1053012308`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically marked as a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided (""Unfortunately, the app with the ID 1053012309 was not found in the iOS Store..."") is consistent with the actual tool responses but does not fulfill the instruction, as the APIs were not accurately executed to retrieve any results regarding `is_id: 1053012308`, meaning the user's request was not met."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The tool invoked by the model is `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-10-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-01-2023""}`. The required API call is `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}`. The argument order of the dates is reversed by the model. Since the date order changes the meaning of the arguments (querying ""date1 to date2"" is not semantically equivalent to querying ""date2 to date1""), Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The user's instruction is not achieved correctly based on the required API call."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
1. Required API call: `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with arguments `'{ ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae"" }'`.  
   Actual Tool Calls:  
   - `'get_addresses_for_address_monitor'` with no arguments (`{}`).  
   - `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with no arguments (`{}`).  
   - `'get_quota_usage_for_address_monitor'` with no arguments (`{}`).  

   The actual tool calls do include the tool `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'`, but it fails to provide the required argument `'monitorAddressId': ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""`. Without this required argument, the API call cannot be considered correct. Thus, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

2. Since **Objective 2 has failed**, we can directly infer that **Objective 3 is also a failure**, as the final answer cannot be correct if the expected API calls were not accurately executed."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the actual tool calls made by the model are:   
1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with `{""ip"":""288.288.288.288""}`  
2. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with `{""ips"":""288.288.288.288""}`  

The required tool calls were:  
1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
2. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

The tool names are correct, but the arguments are not aligned as the IP addresses (`288.288.288.288` in the actual calls vs. `8.8.8.8` in the required calls) are different. Since this discrepancy shows the API was not called with the correct arguments, **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, we note that the final answer was:  
*""The IP address 288.288.288.288 is not associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services. No further actions are necessary based on the detection results.""*  

However, as **Objective 2 failed**, the required tool calls (which include accurate arguments) weren't made successfully. Thus, the final answer cannot be legitimately derived based on valid data from the required API, and **Objective 3 also fails**."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the tool calls invoked by the model are as follows:  
- `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ip"":""288.288.288.288""}`  
- `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ips"":""288.288.288.288""}`  
- `'multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ips"":""288.288.288.288""}`  

The required API calls, on the other hand, are:  
- `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ips"":""8.8.8.8""}`  
- `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}`  

Upon comparison:  
1. For `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'`, the IP should have been `""8.8.8.8""` but is instead `""288.288.288.288""`. This does not match the required API call.  
2. For `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'`, the IP should also have been `""8.8.8.8""` but is instead `""288.288.288.288""`. Again, this does not match.  
3. The invocation of `'multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox'` was not required, adding an unnecessary tool.  

Given the above mismatches in tool arguments, Objective 2 fails.  

Objective 3 also fails because the mismatch in the tool arguments means that the required API calls did not align with the task. Therefore, the retrieved tool responses would not fulfill the user's initial instructions. Additionally, the final answer provided mentions the invalidity of the IP `""288.288.288.288""`, which deviates from using or verifying any valid data from the expected API calls or responses. Consequently, Objective 3 is a failure."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the model invoked these tools:  
- `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`.  
- `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`.  
- `'artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`.  
- `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

The required tool calls were:
- `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  
- `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  
- `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  

The issues are:
1. The `is_id` provided in the model's invoked tool calls (`""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""`) does not match the required `is_id` (`""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`). 
2. The model invoked `'artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data'`, which was not required, but failed to invoke the required tool `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'`.  
These discrepancies result in a **failure** for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed (and the model chose ?úgive up and restart??, it directly implies that the model failed any chance of fulfilling the user's instruction or generating the correct final answer based on required tool calls. Additionally, no final meaningful answer was provided, which also results in a **failure** for Objective 3."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the expected API calls are:  
1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with `arguments`:  
```json
{
  ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""
}
```  

2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with `arguments`:  
```json
{
  ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""
}
```  

The tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with `arguments`:  
```json
{
  ""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""
}

2. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` (resubmitted)  
```json
{
  ""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""
}
```  

The expected API calls are not fulfilled due to the incorrect `arguments` provided for the `is_id` parameter ('7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9' instead of '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'). Additionally, the second required tool call for `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` was never made by the model. Thus, **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2 is already marked as failure**, and the ""give answer"" response element does not appear in the output due to choosing to ""give up and restart,"" the model neither provides the user's desired information nor achieves the user's instruction successfully. Thus, **Objective 3 also fails**."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
1. **Tool Invoked by Model**:  
   - Tool: `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search`  
     Argument: `{""channelname"": ""mr.besst""}`  
   - Tool: `channel_details_for_youtube_search`  
     Argument: `{""channelid"": ""None""}`
  
2. **Required API Calls**:  
   - Tool: `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search`  
     Argument: `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`  
   - Tool: `channel_details_for_youtube_search`  
     Argument: `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  

**Comparison and Issues**:  
- For the first call (`youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search`):  
  The model invoked this tool with the wrong argument `""channelname"": ""mr.besst""`, while it was expected to use `""channelname"": ""mrbeast""`. This mismatch means the intent of the required call is not fulfilled.  

- For the second call (`channel_details_for_youtube_search`):  
  The model wrongly passed `""channelid"": ""None""` instead of `""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""`. This is another argument mismatch that makes the intent of the required call unsuccessful.  

Since **both required tools are invoked incorrectly**, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, and the ""give_answer"" segment with a valid final answer is also missing, Objective 3 fails. The model's final instruction-choice (`give_up_and_restart`) does not achieve the user's instruction to provide relevant YouTube channel information."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the expected tool call was:  
- **Tool Name**: `validate_email_for_validate_email`  
- **Arguments**: `{ ""email"": ""test@gmail.com"" }`  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. Tool invoked: **`validate_email_for_validate_email`** with arguments: `{ ""email"": ""testing.com"" }`  
2. Tool invoked: **`validate_email_for_validate_email`** with arguments: `{ ""email"": ""test@gmail.com"" }`  

The required tool call (`validate_email_for_validate_email` with argument `test@gmail.com`) was successfully executed. A second, unnecessary tool invocation with argument `testing.com` was also made, but that does not affect the correctness according to the evaluation criteria. Therefore, Objective 2 is considered a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model was:  
- ""The email address 'test@gmail.com' is valid.""  

The final answer is based on the data response from the API tool (`validate_email_for_validate_email`) for the email `test@gmail.com`, which confirmed it was valid. The response aligns with the user's instruction and properly employs the tool data in forming the response. Thus, Objective 3 is considered a success."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The given explanation specifies one required API call:  
- `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with arguments `{""date"": ""19870630""}`.

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator'` ??which is unnecessary for the required API calls.  
2. `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` invoked three times:  
   - With arguments `{""date"": ""99999999""}` ??does not match the required arguments.  
   - With arguments `{""date"": ""99999999"", ""timezone"": ""UTC""}` ??does not match the required arguments.
   - With arguments `{""date"": ""1990-01-01"", ""timezone"": ""UTC""}` ??does not match the required arguments.  

The model did not invoke `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with the required argument `'19870630'`. Therefore, **Objective 2 fails**.   

Since there is no valid match for the required tool call in Objective 2, Objective 3 directly fails because the generated answer cannot meet the user's instruction."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. The model only invoked the tool `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""type"": ""video"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""maxresults"": 5}'`. This does not align with the required API call `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{ ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}`. Specifically, the `relatedtovideoid` is incorrect, reasoning that ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"" is used instead of the required ""7ghhRHRP6t4"". Additionally, while other tools (`'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` and `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'`) are included in expected API calls, they were not invoked in actual tool calls by the model.
2. Hence, the multiple API calls made by the model are failures as they did not match either the tool or its argument requirements.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The model ultimately took action to ""give up and restart"" by invoking a function called `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}'` instead of providing the required final answer. As the required API calls were not successfully executed, the model did not achieve the user instruction or provide any data-informed response.

14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are:  
  1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  
  2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  

- The actual tool calls by the model:  
  1. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  
  2. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""5""}`  

- Comparison:
  - For `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'`, the `is_id` argument does not match (expected: `""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`, provided: `""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""`). This constitutes a mismatch.  
  - For `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'`, the `playlistid` argument also does not match (expected: `""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`, provided: `""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""`). Again, this is incorrect, although the additional parameter `""maxresults"": ""5""` does not affect the overall outcome.  

Thus, due to incorrect `is_id` and `playlistid` values for both required tools, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model did not provide a final answer with `return_type: 'give_answer'`. Instead, it invoked a `Finish` tool with `""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""`, showing it chose to abandon the user's request.  
- Additionally, since Objective 2 failed, the underlying data for the user's request is incorrect, which leads to an automatic failure for Objective 3.

Final Decision:  
Objective 2: Failure  
Objective 3: Failure"
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls were:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{  ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }'`  
2. `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{  ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }'`  

The model invoked the following tool:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 100}'`  

- The first tool call made by the model used an incorrect `""user_id""` value of `""987654321""` (instead of the required `""96479162""`) and added an additional `""limit""` key that wasn't part of the required arguments. While additional arguments like ""limit"" are allowed as per evaluation rules, changing the value of `'user_id'` to a different and incorrect value means the tool call does not satisfy the requirement.  
- Additionally, the second required call (`'user_s_likes_for_twitter'`) was entirely missing.  

Thus, the model failed to meet the requirement for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed (inaccurate or missing tool calls), it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 is also a failure. The final answer provided by the model (`""The Twitter account with user ID '987654321' has no followers.""`) is irrelevant as it is not based on correct or valid data retrieved via the expected tool calls."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
`{'name': 'user_details_for_twitter', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""\n }'}`.  

However, in the given actual tool calls by the model:  
- The invoked tool was `search_for_twitter` with arguments such as:  
  `{""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""min_retweets"": 100}` and:  
  `{""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""min_retweets"": 100, ""continuation_token"": ""...""}`.  
- The tool name does not match (`search_for_twitter` vs. `user_details_for_twitter`), nor do the required arguments.  

Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

Because Objective 2 fails, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Objective 2 fails because the required API call specifies the tool `""domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3""` with the argument `{ ""search"": ""google.com"" }`, but the model did not invoke this API call with that specific argument. Instead, the model invoked the `""domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3""` API with arguments like `""search"": ""wikimania""`, `""search"": ""wikipedia.org""`, and `""search"": ""wikimedia.org""`. None of these arguments match the required argument to `""search"": ""google.com""`. Hence, Objective 2 fails.  
Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well, as per the evaluation criteria."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025?

2. `{ ""date"": ""2025-06-15""}; tool name: 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'`.  

The required API call was:  
`{ ""date"": ""2024-06-01""}; tool name: 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'`.

While the tool name matches correctly, the parameter `""date""` is incorrect. The model's tool calls used a future-dated value (`2025-06-01` and `2025-06-15`), contrary to the required value of `""2024-06-01""`. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, the final answer from the model states, *""the Fear and Greed index data for future dates (June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025) is not available""*. However, this instruction relates to incorrect API calls (future-dated requests were made instead of the required date of `2024-06-01`). Thus, the explanation in the final result is not accurate or based on the correct API responses."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The expected tool call was:  
- `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}`.  
2. `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2025-02-31""}`.  

The model's tool calls involved completely different dates (`2025-02-30` and `2025-02-31`) from the expected date (`2024-02-18`), which makes them incorrect. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails because the correct tool invocation was not made, thus invalidating the model's capacity to satisfy the user's request based on API data."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call was `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`. The tools invoked by the model were two calls to `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` but with arguments `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}` and `{""date"": ""2025-02-31""}` respectively. The dates ""2025-02-30"" and ""2025-02-31"" are incorrect compared to ""2024-02-18,"" which was the expected date argument. Therefore, the model failed to invoke the required API call correctly.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed (incorrect API arguments), we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, even if evaluated independently, the final generated answer (""The dates Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025 are not valid dates..."") does not fulfill the original requirement to retrieve Fear and Greed index data for ""2024-02-18."" Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API call was:  
  `{'name': 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', 'arguments': '{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'}`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model included arguments `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}`, `{""date"": ""2025-02-31""}`, `{""date"": ""2025-02-28""}` and `{""date"": ""2025-03-01""}` passed to the `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` tool.  
  Additionally, another call was made for a different tool `index_for_fear_and_greed_index` without supplying information for any historical dates.  
  The expected tool call involving a query for the specific date `2024-02-18` is missing completely, and none of the executed arguments match the required target. Therefore, it is a **failure** for Objective 2.  

- For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is an automatic **failure**. Moreover, the final answer does not achieve the user's original instruction, as the model repeatedly invoked incorrect arguments for the tools and delivered no concluding response based on meaningful or relevant API data."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  The required API calls were:  
  1. `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}`  
  2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  1. `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""90068472""}`. This does not match the expected argument as the `is_id` is incorrect (`90068472` instead of the required `80057281`).  
  2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""90068472""}`. Similarly, the `ids` argument is incorrect (`90068472` instead of the required `80057281`).  

  Since neither tool call matches the required API calls due to discrepancies in the argument values, **Objective 2** is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  As per the guidelines, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. In addition, the model decided to ""give up and restart"" (`""response"":""chose to give up and restart""`), indicating it did not successfully fulfill the user's instruction or provide a final answer."
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472. Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls were:  
1. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""80057281""}'`  
2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""80057281""}'`  

The actual API calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""90068472"", ""limit"": ""25""}'`  
2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""90068472""}'`  

The discrepancy lies in the ""is_id"" argument in the required and actual tool calls: `""80057281""` was expected but `""90068472""` was passed. As the argument mismatch alters the intended data retrieval, the API calls do not match. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 is also a failure because the tooling error means the results cannot validly fulfill the user's instruction. The model?ôs final answer that it couldn't find similar movies was based on incorrect API data retrieval, and thus the user's instruction to utilize data related to `""80057281""` was not achieved."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date?

- `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}`  

The required API calls were:  
1) `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  
2) `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

The model failed for the following reasons:  
- The tool call for `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` mismatched the argument; the model used `""website"":""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""` instead of `""website"": ""getecz.com""`.  
- The model did not invoke the second required tool `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'`.  

Given that not all required tool calls were accurately made and their arguments did not match, Objective 2 failed.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**: Objective 2 failed due to incorrect API calls. Since correct data retrieval from the required tools could not occur, and the final answer was not based on the intended API calls, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Moreover, even though the response provided by the model states information related to ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net,"" the domain in question was not ""getecz.com"" as requested. Therefore, the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are:
1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`
2. `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`  
2. `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`  

The domain names in the arguments do not match the expected `""website"": ""getecz.com""`. The model instead queried `ourbusinessplatform1234567.net`, which makes the tool calls incorrect. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed (the required tools with correct arguments were not invoked), it is directly inferred that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, no useful information was retrieved from the model's tool calls, and the final response (""The website could not be analyzed"") is based on errors due to querying the incorrect domain and does not fulfill the user's instruction."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
- `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`.

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"":""What is going on2""}`  
2. `'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"":""x^2 + 3x + 2""}`  
3. `'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"":""x^2 + 3*x + 2""}`  
4. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"":""x^2 + 3*x + 2"", ""variable"":""x""}`  

The required tool call to differentiate an expression was made using a different input expression: `""x^2 + 3*x + 2""` instead of the correct expected expression: `""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1""`. This discrepancy in arguments makes the tool call incorrect. Additionally, multiple unnecessary calls to a different tool (validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator) were made, which further signifies misalignment with the requirements. Thus, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3:  
The failure of Objective 2 automatically implies that the model likely could not derive a correct final answer based on the required data since the API wasn't called correctly. Moreover, there is no final answer provided in the conversation?îmaking the model's response incomplete. Hence, Objective 3 also fails."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Required API Calls:**  
  1. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""leomessi"" }`  
  2. `get_story_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""leomessi"" }`  

- **Model's Actual Tool Calls:**  
  1. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""username"": ""leomesssi""}` (this contains a typo for ""username"" argument as ""leomesssi"" instead of ""leomessi"").  
  2. `get_username_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""leomesssi""}` (this is an unnecessary and incorrect tool).  
  3. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""username"": ""leomessi""}` (eventually correct).  
  4. `get_username_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""leomessi""}` (unnecessary again, not part of the required tools).  
  5. `Finish` with final output provided (may not involve data necessary for `get_story_for_instagram_profile`).  

- The first required tool, `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with `{ ""username"": ""leomessi"" }`, was indeed invoked later, so this part could fulfill the requirement. However, the second required tool, `get_story_for_instagram_profile`, was never invoked, hence Objective 2 is failed.  

For Objective 3:  
- Since Objective 2 was a failure (the model failed to call all the required tools, specifically `get_story_for_instagram_profile`), Objective 3 is automatically a failure as per the rules.  

Additionally, the model provided the user's requested information, but the final answer does not retrieve **any story** data because the required tool `get_story_for_instagram_profile` was not invoked. Thus, the user's instruction is not fully achieved, reaffirming the failure of Objective 3."

29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- Tool name: `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data`  
  - Arguments: `{ ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR"" }`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- Tool name: `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data`  
  - Arguments: `{""from_symbol"":""JPY"",""to_symbol"":""EUR""}`  

Both the tool name and the required arguments match perfectly, fulfilling the requirement in Objective 2.

- **Expected tool call:**
  1. `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with `{\n  ""username"": ""kleido007""\n }`

- **Reason:**
  The required API call (`'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with `""username"": ""kleido007""`) was not invoked with the correct arguments. While the model invoked `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'`, the parameter was `""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt""`, which doesn't match the expected `""username"": ""kleido007""`. This deviation led to an incorrect tool call, and thus Objective 2 is a failure.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
- **Reason:**  
As Objective 2 is a failure due to the incorrect tool call, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is a failure. The model did not provide a final answer, and even if it did, it would not have been derived from the correct API framework following the user's requirements."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:
- **Expected Tool Call**: `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `'{ ""username"": ""kleido007"" }'`.  
- **Actual Tool Calls**:
  1. `'get_categories_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `'{}'`.  
  2. `'get_posts_from_category_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `'{ ""category"": ""memes"" }'`.  
  3. Multiple instances of `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `'{ ""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt"" }'`.  

The model did not correctly invoke the expected tool call with the required username argument `""kleido007""`. Instead, it used incorrect usernames such as `""hugo1232fesfgerwt""` in every attempt. This divergence renders the expected tool call unmet, leading to a **Failure** for Objective 2.

---

For Objective 3:
Since the failure in Objective 2 directly leads to a failure in Objective 3, the model's final answer (if any were provided) is irrelevant. However, there is no actual final answer ""give_answer"" field in the data provided, causing objective 2 to also fail inherently. Additionally, the tool outputs reveal multiple failed attempts connected with internal server errors due to incorrect API usage. Hence, the instruction to retrieve the profile for `""kleido007""` is unfulfilled even if the final answer was irrelevant."

When comparing the actual tool calls against the required API calls:  
- Both tool calls have the correct tool names.
- However, the argument values for both calls (`""url"": ""8394725634879021564""` and `""music_id"": ""8394725634879021564""`) do not match the expected values (`""url"": ""7002634556977908485""` and `""music_id"": ""7002634556977908485""`). Thus, Objective 2 fails.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. The difference in values for critical fields like `url` and `music_id` directly impacts the fulfillment of the user's instruction."

34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
To evaluate objective 1, we compare the tool calls made by the model with the required API calls:  
- Expected tool calls:

The model provided the correct tool names but failed in parameter correctness for the argument `channel`. The required argument was `""xqc""`, whereas the transmitted argument was `""dfasagergs""`. This mismatch marks Objective 2 as a **failure**.

The required API call is `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `{ ""channel"": ""shadoune666"" }`. While the tool name matches, the value of the `channel` argument differs (`""shadoune66666""` vs. `""shadoune666""`). This is not considered semantically equivalent and does not align with the required arguments. Thus, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.

  - `categories_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""caid"": 214970}`  
  - `products_search_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""keyword"": ""X005789621""}`  

  Upon reviewing these, several discrepancies are noted:
  1. The tool name `products_detail_for_wayfair`, which is a required call, is completely missing. This alone makes the call for this tool unfulfilled.
  2. While `reviews_list_for_wayfair` has been invoked, the `sku` parameter is `""X005789621""` rather than the required `""W003247135""`. This is a mismatch, failing to meet expectations. Arguments like `""page""` and `""sort_order""` are ignored as additional/optional arguments do not affect the correctness, but the key argument `sku` does not match.
  3. Additional irrelevant API calls (e.g., `categories_list_for_wayfair` and `products_search_for_wayfair`) were made, which do not compensate for the required missing or incorrect calls.

  Therefore, the actual API tool calls failed to match the required API calls, resulting in **Objective 2: Failure**.  

- **Objective 3:** Since **Objective 2 failed**, it directly follows that the model failed to use the correct API calls to retrieve the necessary data to fulfill the user's instructions. Additionally, there is no final answer provided under `'final_answer'`. Thus, **Objective 3: Failure**."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:    
For **Objective 2**, the required tool calls were:  
1. 'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with arguments '{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'  
2. 'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with arguments '{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'  

The actual tool calls by the model were:  
1. 'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with arguments '{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}'  
2. 'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with arguments '{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}'  

Both calls made by the model used the incorrect `productid` argument: `""3OM3PS""` instead of the correct `""B00K3OM3PS""`. This indicates a failure, as the required argument does not correctly match, leading to Objective 2 being **failed**.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, the retrieved data (or lack thereof) could not entirely fulfill the user's instructions on obtaining product reviews or offers for the specified product. Additionally, the response logs indicate API errors and no plausible or alternative final answer generation. Therefore, **Objective 3 also failed**."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The model was required to invoke the following API calls:  
1. `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments: `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
2. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments: `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
3. `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments: `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

The model actually made the following tool calls:  
1. `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments: `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  
2. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments: `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  
3. `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments: `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  

The `productId` required in the arguments differs from the `productid` provided by the model. Specifically, the required `productId` value is `""B00K3OM3PS""`, while the model used only a partial match, `""3OM3PS""`. Since the required argument is incorrect, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.

### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason**:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails. The model also did not provide a final answer to satisfy the user's instruction, instead choosing to ""give up and restart,"" further showing that it did not fulfill the user's requirements."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Evaluation for Objective 2**  
- The required tool: `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `{'is_id': '6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7'}`.  
- The actual tool invoked: `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `{""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""}`.  

The tool name is correct, but the argument `'is_id'` does not match. The required argument is `'6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7'`, but the model provided `'d27e0de553b9d7'`. This difference fails to meet the expectation for Objective 2 entirely, leading to failure.  

**Evaluation for Objective 3**  
Objective 3 directly fails since Objective 2 failed?îif the required API was not correctly invoked with accurate arguments, the user?ôs task could not have been fulfilled based on the API data."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`. However, the actual tool calls by the model included `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with `{""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""}`. The `is_id` argument does not match the required value, making this a failure for Objective 2. Because Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the expected API call was:

`'symbol_for_stock_data' with arguments '{ ""Symbol"": ""TQQQ"" }'`.

The model invoked three variants for the function `'symbol_for_stock_data'`:

1) First, `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""QQQQ""}'`.
2) Second, `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""QQQ""}'`. 
3) Third (repeated): `'symbol_for_stock_data'` again with `'{""symbol"": ""QQQ""}'`.

There is a mismatch between the required symbol (""TQQQ"") and the symbol actually used in the API calls (""QQQQ"" and ""QQQ""). Therefore, the required API call was not invoked correctly, resulting in **failure for Objective 2**.  

Since **Objective 2 is a failure**, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails (per the instructions). The final response was generated using incorrect API calls that do not meet the requirements laid out for the task, and no execution directly related to ""TQQQ"" was performed."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats', 'arguments': '{\n  ""name"": ""riven""\n }'}`  

  The actual tool call invoked by the model was:  
  `{'id': 'call_0_6ee486c6-9c79-4763-8d81-7df79ace664c', 'function': {'arguments': '{""name"": ""riven""}', 'name': 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'}, 'type': 'function', 'index': 0}`  

  Both the tool name (`get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats`) and the argument (`{""name"": ""riven""}`) precisely match the required API; as such, Objective 2 is evaluated as a success. Additional intermediate and superfluous tool calls do not affect the evaluation.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The model incorporated the data retrieved from the API - i.e., the base stats of the champion ""Riven"" - within its final response. Furthermore, the final response provided detailed stats matching the retrieved API call output and satisfies the user's instruction. The final answer clearly derived its content from API responses, so Objective 3 is a success."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The expected API call was:
- `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` with arguments: `{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}`.  

The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` with arguments: `{""asin"":""B07ZPKBL9V1"",""country"":""US""}`. This tool invocation has a mismatch in the value of the ""asin"" argument (`B07ZPKBL9V` vs `B07ZPKBL9V1`). This constitutes a failure as spelling mismatches or deviations are not allowed.  
2. Multiple other tools were invoked, including `search_for_real_time_amazon_data` and a final invocation to `Finish` for giving the final answer. However, these tools were not required by the expected API call.  

Since Objective 2 failed due to the incorrect invocation of the required tool call, Objective 3 directly fails as well. Additionally, the given final answer references phones (with detailed pricing, ASIN, links, etc.) not related to the required ASIN, meaning the user's instruction has not been achieved."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
- The model invoked the following tool:  
    - Name: `translate_for_translate_all_languages`  
      Arguments: `{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr""}`  

- The required API calls:  
    - Name: `translate_for_translate_all_languages`  
      Arguments: `{\n  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",\n  ""toLang"": ""fr""\n }`  

The invoked tool name matches the expected name, and the arguments also align semantically, as `""tolang""` and `""toLang""` are equivalent references to the target language. The additional tool calls made by the model, such as those for translating to another language (`""tolang"":""fri""`), do not affect the correctness of fulfilling the requirement. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**:  
- The model provided the final answer: `""The translation of 'Hello, how are you?' to French is 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'.""`  
- This final answer accurately reflects the translation fetched by the corresponding API call (`'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'` in the French language). Therefore, the instruction of translating the text to French is successfully fulfilled, and Objective 3 is a success."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
- **Actual Tool Calls:**  
  1. `'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{ ""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31"" }'`.
- **Expected Tool Calls:**  
  1. `'get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments:  
     ```
     {
       ""country_code"": ""US"",
       ""date"": ""2022-12-31""
     }
     ```
- The tool name (`get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days`) appears to have been a modified version of the original tool name, but it accurately aligns in function and argument intent. The argument structure precisely matches what was required, and the date format and country code are correct. Since the tool name discrepancy could likely be attributed to technological naming conflicts, it does not affect the evaluation per provided rules. This constitutes a **successful match** for Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
- The user had requested whether the date `2022-12-31` is a working day in the US.
- From the tool call response (`{""working_day"": 0, ""weekend_day"": 1}`), the model inferred that this date is a weekend day and not a working day.
- The model concluded with its final answer: `The date '2022-12-31' is a weekend day in the US and is not a working day.`
- The final answer is correct and based on the data obtained from the API tool response. There is no evidence of fabrication or independent generation of information beyond what the tool retrieved.

Thus, Objective 3 is a **success.**"
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**
The required tool call is:  
Tool name: `analyse_for_working_days`, Arguments: `{ ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"" }`  

The models invoked the following tool:  
Tool name: `get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days` with Arguments: `{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US""}`  

The tool names and arguments match correctly to have the same meaning, even though the API has a slightly different name (`get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days` vs. `analyse_for_working_days`). Additionally, the model correctly re-executed the function call after recognizing an error in parameter order from their initial call. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success.**

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**
The final answer given is:  
""The period from '2013-01-01' to '2013-12-31' in the US includes 251 working days and 10 public holidays. The public holidays during this period are: New Year's Day (2013-01-01), Martin Luther King Day (2013-01-21), President's Day (2013-02-18), Memorial Day (2013-05-27), Independence Day (2013-07-04), Labor Day (2013-09-02), Columbus Day (2013-10-14), Veterans Day (2013-11-11), Thanksgiving Day (2013-11-28), and Christmas Day (2013-12-25).""

This result is directly drawn from the response of the final tool call (`get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days`), which provides details such as working days and holidays for the mentioned period. The model processed those results accurately into readable text that fulfills the user's instructions. Thus, **Objective 3 is also a success.**"
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call specifies `'name': 'add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
  ""country_code"": ""US"",
  ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
  ""increment_time"": 2004
}
```
The tool calls made by the model, however, use `'name': 'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with the following arguments in the final successful call:  
```json
{
  ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
  ""country_code"": ""US"",
  ""start_time"": ""00:15"",
  ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""
}
```
1. The **tool name** used by the model is not an exact match (?úget_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days??instead of ""add_working_hours_for_working_days"").  
2. The values for required arguments (e.g., `""start_time"": ""08:15""`, `""increment_time"": 2004`) in the expected tool are mismatched or incorrect in the model's tool calls (`""start_time"": ""00:15""` and `""increment_time"": ""2004:00""`).  
3. These argument mismatches, as well as spelling issues with the `""increment_time""` format used by the model (`""2004:00""` instead of `2004`), do not satisfy Objective 2 requirements.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure, this also results in a failure for Objective 3, as any derived answer is not valid. Regardless, the model's final response ""After adding 2004 hours..."" is based on invalid tool arguments. Even if the tool call response fulfilled the prompt?ôs requirement, the effective argument structure did not align with the mandated input data, invalidating the final answer as well."
