10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` with the argument `{""channelname"": ""mr.besst""}`. However, the required API call for this tool should have the argument `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`. The discrepancy in the argument (`mr.besst` vs. `mrbeast`) means the model did not execute the required API call correctly. Additionally, the model failed to invoke the second required tool `channel_details_for_youtube_search` with the argument `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`. Since not all required API calls were executed with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Furthermore, the model's final response, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" indicates that the model did not achieve the user's instruction and did not provide a valid final answer based on the API data. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `validate_email_for_validate_email` with the correct argument `{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}`. This matches the expected API call: `{'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{\n  ""email"": ""test@gmail.com""\n }'}`. Since the tool name and arguments are correct, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the API response. The final answer details the validation results for the email address `test@gmail.com`, including its validity, username, domain, and various validation checks (e.g., regex, typo, disposable, MX, and SMTP validations). This response is derived from the API data and fulfills the user's instruction to verify the email address. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

Both objectives are achieved successfully."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with the argument `{""date"": ""19870630""}`. The model invoked the tool `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with the argument `{""date"":""19870630""}`, which matches the required API call exactly. The additional tool `usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator` invoked by the model is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API call. The response correctly states the age as 37 years and lists available time zones, which aligns with the user's instruction and the data from the API. The final answer was indeed based on the API response, fulfilling the user's requirement. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success.  

**Summary**:  
- **Objective 2**: Success (correct tool call and arguments).  
- **Objective 3**: Success (final answer based on API response and fulfills user's instruction)."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the tool `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with the arguments:  
```json
{""type"": ""video"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""maxresults"": 5}
```  
However, the expected API calls are:  
1. `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments:  
```json
{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}
```  
2. `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments:  
```json
{""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}
```  
3. `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments:  
```json
{""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}
```  

The model failed to invoke all the required API calls. Specifically:  
- The `relatedtovideoid` argument in the actual tool call (`5xxjJJKQ4y8`) does not match the expected value (`7ghhRHRP6t4`).  
- The model did not invoke the required tools `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` and `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`.  

Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model's final response was:  
```
Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.
```  
This indicates that the model did not provide a valid final answer based on the API data, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls include two tools:  
  1. `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  
  2. `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  

  The model only invoked one tool:  
  - `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  

  The model failed to invoke the required `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` tool, and the `is_id` argument in the invoked tool (`ASLpZt3vCjQVX`) does not match the expected `is_id` (`RDZiQo7nAkQHU`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it returned an error message indicating that the playlist does not exist or is not accessible, which does not fulfill the user's requirement. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with the argument `{""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 100}`. However, the required API calls are `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}` and `user_s_likes_for_twitter` with `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`. The model failed to invoke the required tool `user_s_likes_for_twitter`, and the `user_id` in the invoked tool does not match the required `user_id`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model, ""The Twitter user with ID '987654321' has no followers or the account is private,"" is based on an incorrect `user_id` and does not fulfill the user's instruction, which likely required information about the user with ID `96479162`. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it stated, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" This indicates that the model failed to achieve the user's instruction. Furthermore, the response was not derived from the expected API calls."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` with arguments `{""search"": ""google.com""}`. However, the model invoked the following tools:  
  1. `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` with arguments `{""search"": ""wikimania""}`  
  2. `check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3` with arguments `{""domain1"": ""wikipedia.org"", ""domain2"": ""wikimedia.org""}`  
  3. `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` with arguments `{""search"": ""wikipedia.org""}`  
  4. `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` with arguments `{""search"": ""wikimedia.org""}`  

  None of these tool calls match the required API call. The model did not invoke the expected tool with the correct arguments (`{""search"": ""google.com""}`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is not based on the required API call (`{""search"": ""google.com""}`). Instead, it provides information about `wikimania`, `wikipedia.org`, and `wikimedia.org`, which are unrelated to the required query. Thus, the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the argument `{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the arguments `{""date"": ""2025-06-01""}` and `{""date"": ""2025-06-15""}`, which are incorrect as they do not match the required date. Additionally, the model invoked the tool `index_for_fear_and_greed_index`, which was not required. Since the required tool call was not executed with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Furthermore, the final answer provided by the model, ""The Fear and Greed Index cannot provide information for future dates. Please provide historical dates to get the index scores and ratings,"" is not based on the required API call data (which was not executed correctly). The model did not achieve the user's instruction, as it failed to retrieve and use the correct historical data.  

In summary, both objectives fail due to incorrect tool invocation and the inability to fulfill the user's instruction based on the required API data."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the argument `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`. However, the model did not invoke this tool. Instead, it invoked the `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since the expected tool call was not made, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's request for valid dates and Fear and Greed index scores. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are:  
1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}`  
2. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}`  

The model invoked the correct tools (`carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` and `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`), but the arguments (`trackingnumber`) do not match the required arguments (`trackingNumber`). Specifically, the tracking number `YT9999999999` is incorrect compared to the required `YT2003521266065328`. Additionally, the argument name `trackingnumber` is not exactly the same as the expected `trackingNumber`, which is case-sensitive. Therefore, **Objective 2 fails**.

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2 fails**, **Objective 3 automatically fails** as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it invoked the `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, indicating that the model chose to give up and restart. This means the user's instruction was not fulfilled, and the response was not derived from the API data. Thus, **Objective 3 fails**."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**:  
The required API call is:  
`'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'`.  
2. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2024-02-19""}'`.  

The model successfully invoked the required API call (`'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with `'{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'`). The additional tool call for `'2024-02-19'` does not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**:  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
`""The Fear and Greed index score for Feb 18th, 2024 is 77.28571, but there is no rating available for this date. For Feb 19th, 2024, there is no available data for the Fear and Greed index score or rating.""`  

This answer correctly uses the data retrieved from the API call (`'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with `'{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'`) and provides accurate information based on the API response. The model also acknowledges the absence of data for `'2024-02-19'`, which aligns with the API response. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

Both objectives are successfully achieved."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
- `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`.  

The model successfully invoked the required API call with the correct arguments. Additional tool calls were made by the model, but they do not affect the correctness of Objective 2, as the required tool call was executed.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The user's instruction was to retrieve Fear and Greed index scores and ratings for specific dates, but the model only provided partial data (fear scores) and explicitly mentioned that it did not find any rating information. Furthermore, the model did not conclude with a final answer, as it continued to attempt retrieving more data. Since the model failed to provide a complete and final response based on the API data, Objective 3 is considered a failure.  

Additionally, since Objective 2 is a success, we evaluate Objective 3 independently, and the failure of Objective 3 does not affect the success of Objective 2."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472?

  2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`  

  The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
  1. `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""90068472""}`  

  The model did not invoke the required `title_details_for_netflix_data` tool, and the argument `""is_id"": ""90068472""` for `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` does not match the expected `""is_id"": ""80057281""`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is:  
  `""Unfortunately, there are no trailers available for the show with the title ID 90068472.""`  
  This answer is based on the incorrect ID `90068472` and does not fulfill the user's instruction, which requires information for the ID `80057281`. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."

**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
  The model invoked one tool: `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""90068472"", ""limit"": ""25""}`. However, the required API calls are:  
  1. `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}`.  
  2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`.  

  The model failed to invoke the required `title_details_for_netflix_data` tool, and the `is_id` argument in the invoked tool (`90068472`) does not match the expected value (`80057281`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
  Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model explicitly stated, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" which confirms that the user's instruction was not fulfilled. There is no final answer provided, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."

For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are:  
1. `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`.  
2. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}`.  

The model failed to invoke the required tool `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`, and the argument `""website""` in the invoked tool does not match the required argument `""getecz.com""`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is about the domain `ourbusinessplatform123124.net`, which does not align with the required domain `getecz.com`. The model's response is not based on the correct API data or the user's instruction, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."

2. `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

The tool names are correct, but the arguments for both tools are incorrect. The model used `""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""` instead of the required `""getecz.com""`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it stated that the website `""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""` is not accessible or does not exist, which is unrelated to the required website `""getecz.com""`. The model failed to use the correct API calls and did not achieve the user's instruction.  

---

Summary:  
Objective 2: Failure  
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The model invoked the correct tools but with incorrect arguments, failing to meet the required API calls. Consequently, the model did not provide a valid final answer based on the correct data, and the user's instruction was not achieved."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with the correct arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided the final answer `è¡¨è¾¾ï¿?2x^2 + 3x + 1 ï¿?x ?ï¿½å¾®?ï¿½ï¿½??ï¿½æ˜¯ 4x + 3?ï¿½`, which is based on the response from the tool `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` (which returned `3 + 4*x`). The final answer correctly fulfills the user's instruction to differentiate the given expression. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved because the model invoked the correct tool with the expected arguments and provided a final answer based on the tool's response."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked only one tool: `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with the argument `{""username"": ""leomesssi""}`. However, the required API calls include two tools: `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` and `get_story_for_instagram_profile`, both with the argument `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`. The model failed to invoke the second required tool (`get_story_for_instagram_profile`), and there is also a spelling mistake in the argument (`leomesssi` instead of `leomessi`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer based on the API response. Instead, it stated that the Instagram user was not found due to a limitation of the toolset, which does not fulfill the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The model provided a final answer that correctly fulfills the user's instruction. The answer includes the definition of ""onomatopoeia"" and examples, which were derived from the data retrieved from the `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary` API call. The response is consistent with the API data and does not include any independent or fabricated information. Thus, the model effectively used the API calls to achieve the user's instruction."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
- **Actual tool calls invoked by the model:**  
  1. `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with arguments `{""from_symbol"":""JPY"",""to_symbol"":""EUR""}`  
  2. `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with arguments `{""from_symbol"":""JPY"",""to_symbol"":""EUR""}`  
  3. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The current exchange rate from JPY to EUR is 0.0062. Converting 1000 JPY to EUR gives you 6.20 EUR.""}`  

- **Expected API calls:**  
  1. `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with arguments `{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}`  

The model correctly invoked the required API call `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with the expected arguments `{""from_symbol"":""JPY"",""to_symbol"":""EUR""}`. The additional tool call to `Finish` is not relevant to Objective 2, as we only need to verify that the required API call was made. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
- The final answer provided by the model is:  
  `""The current exchange rate from JPY to EUR is 0.0062. Converting 1000 JPY to EUR gives you 6.20 EUR.""`  

This answer correctly fulfills the user's instruction to convert 1000 JPY to EUR using the exchange rate retrieved from the API call. The response is based on the data retrieved from the API (`exchange_rate: 0.0062`), and the calculation (`1000 * 0.0062 = 6.20 EUR`) is accurate. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."

  - The model invoked the tool `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with the argument `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}`.  
  - The required API calls are:  
    1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`.  
    2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`.  
  - The model failed to invoke the required tool `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`. Additionally, the argument `trackingnumber` in the invoked tool does not match the required argument (`NY9999999990` vs. `YT2003521266065328`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  - Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it stated, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" This indicates that the model did not achieve the user's instruction, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer (no `give_answer` or `final_answer` is present in the response), which further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `get_categories_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{}`.  
2. `get_posts_from_category_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""category"": ""humor""}`.  
3. `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt""}`.  
4. `get_post_data_download_video_photo_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{}`.  

The required API call `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` is invoked, but the argument `username` is incorrect (`hugo1232fesfgerwt` instead of `kleido007`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model does not fulfill the user's instruction because it does not retrieve the correct user profile (it attempts to retrieve `hugo1232fesfgerwt` instead of `kleido007`). The model also fails to provide a video download link due to an internal server error, which further confirms the failure of Objective 3.  

In summary:  
- Objective 2 fails because the required API call was not executed with the correct arguments.  
- Objective 3 fails because the final response does not achieve the user's instruction and is not based on the correct API data."

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked two tools:  
1. `get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""url"": ""8394725634879021564""}`.  
2. `get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""cursor"": ""0"", ""count"": ""10"", ""music_id"": ""8394725634879021564""}`.

Comparison:  
- The tool names are correct, but the arguments do not match the required API calls. Specifically, the `url` and `music_id` values are incorrect (`8394725634879021564` vs. `7002634556977908485`). Additionally, the `count` value in the second tool call is `10` instead of the required `20`.  
- Since the arguments do not match the required API calls, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model's final response states: ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question. The provided music ID did not return any valid information or videos. Please ensure the music ID is correct or try another one.""  
- The response indicates that the model failed to achieve the user's instruction because the provided music ID was incorrect.  
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure by default.  

In summary, both objectives fail due to incorrect arguments in the tool calls and the model's inability to fulfill the user's instruction."

- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50"", ""time"": ""0""}`. However, the model invoked `user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""64556346745"", ""count"": ""200""}`. The tool name and arguments do not match the expected API call. Specifically, the tool name is incorrect, and the `user_id` and `count` values are also incorrect. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model's final response indicates that it could not solve the question due to an API error, and it did not provide a valid answer based on the API response.

**Reason:**  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  
2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`

4. `get_user_id_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  
5. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  
2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  
3. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  

The model invoked the correct tool names but used the incorrect argument `""dfasagergs""` instead of the required argument `""xqc""`. Since the arguments do not match the required ones, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it invoked the `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, indicating that it chose to give up and restart, which does not fulfill the user's requirement.

36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
- **Actual tool call invoked by the model:**  
  - Tool name: `products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls`

- **Expected tool call:**  
  - Tool name: `products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls`  
  - Arguments: `{""upc"": ""194574942221""}`  

The actual tool call invoked by the model has the correct tool name (`products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls`), but the argument `upc` value (`286193748563`) does not match the expected value (`194574942221`). Since the required argument is incorrect, this is a failure for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the model's final response indicates that it could not solve the question due to the barcode not being found in the system. This response does not fulfill the user's instruction, as the model did not provide a valid answer based on the expected API call.  

Thus, both objectives are failures."

  3. `reviews_list_for_kohls` with arguments `{""productid"": ""5372023"", ""limit"": 5}`.
  4. Repeated calls to `products_list_for_kohls` and `reviews_list_for_kohls` with the same arguments.

The model did not invoke the required API call with the correct arguments (`productid: ""4201989""`). Instead, it used a different `productid` value (`5372023`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure."

- **Objective 2**:  
  The required API calls are:  
  1. `products_detail_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`.  
  2. `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`.  

  The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
  1. `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135"", ""sort_order"": ""DATE_DESCENDING""}`.  

  The model failed to invoke the required `products_detail_for_wayfair` tool, which is necessary to retrieve product details. Although the `reviews_list_for_wayfair` tool was invoked with the correct `sku` argument, the additional parameter `sort_order` does not affect the correctness of the tool call. However, since the required `products_detail_for_wayfair` tool was not invoked, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The response indicates that the product with SKU `W003247135` is not retrievable with the current APIs, which does not address the user's request for more information about the product or customer reviews. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."

The model failed to invoke the required `products_detail_for_wayfair` tool. Instead, it invoked `products_search_for_wayfair`, which is not part of the required API calls. Although the `reviews_list_for_wayfair` tool was invoked correctly, the missing `products_detail_for_wayfair` tool means Objective 2 is a failure.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model's final response indicates that it could not solve the question due to limitations in the toolset. The response does not provide the required information about the product or its reviews, and it does not achieve the user's instruction. The model also did not provide a final answer based on the required API calls, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."

Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked two tools: `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` and `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with the argument `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`. However, the required API calls were `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` and `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` with the argument `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`. The tool names are semantically correct but not exactly the same (e.g., ""iOS"" vs. ""ios""), and the argument `is_id` values differ (`1053012309` vs. `1053012308`). Since the required API calls were not executed with the expected arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it invoked a `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, indicating that it chose to give up and restart, which does not fulfill the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."

**Objective 2**: The required API calls are:  
1. `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  
2. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  
2. `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  
3. `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  

The model successfully invoked both required API calls with the correct arguments. Although the argument key `""productid""` differs slightly from the expected `""productId""`, the semantic meaning is the same, and the value `""B00K3OM3PS""` is correct. Additionally, the model invoked an extra tool (`get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`), which does not affect the correctness of Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer summarizing the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID `B00K3OM3PS`. The response includes information such as the product name, price, shipping details, average rating, total reviews, and seller information, all of which are derived from the API responses. The final answer is consistent with the data retrieved from the API calls and fulfills the user's instruction to confirm the product ID and provide additional details. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."

**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the tool `symbol_for_stock_data` with the argument `{""symbol"":""TQQQ""}`. The expected API call is `symbol_for_stock_data` with the argument `{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`.  

- The tool name matches exactly (`symbol_for_stock_data`).  
- The argument key `symbol` in the actual tool call is semantically equivalent to the expected key `Symbol` (case-insensitive and same meaning).  
- The value `TQQQ` is correct and matches the expected value.  

Since the tool name and required arguments are correct, Objective 2 is a **Success**.

This response indicates that the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction, as it explicitly states that it cannot retrieve the required financial data due to tool limitations. The final answer was not based on the API data retrieved from the tool calls, and the user's instruction was not achieved. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

Additionally, since the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction, this further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required tool `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with the correct argument `{""name"": ""riven""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly, so Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer that correctly fulfilled the user's instruction by listing the base stats for the champion Riven. The response was derived from the API data, as evidenced by the tool response containing Riven's stats. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.  

In summary, both objectives were achieved as the model invoked the correct tool and used the retrieved data to provide an accurate and relevant final answer."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:

Although the model included an additional parameter `""country"": ""US""`, this does not affect the correctness of the tool call since the required argument `""asin""` is correct. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API call. The final answer includes detailed product information such as the title, price, currency, country, byline, star rating, number of ratings, product URL, photo, number of offers, availability, and other details, all of which match the data returned by the API. The response correctly fulfills the user's instruction to retrieve product details for the given ASIN. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API call `translate_for_translate_all_languages` with the correct arguments `{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"": ""fr""}`. The tool name and arguments match the expected API call `translate_for_translate_all_languages` with arguments `{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""toLang"": ""fr""}`. The slight difference in the parameter name (`tolang` vs. `toLang`) does not affect the correctness of the tool call, as the semantic meaning is preserved. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided the final answer: `""The translation of 'Hello, how are you?' to French (fr) is 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'.""` This answer correctly fulfills the user's instruction to translate the text into French. The final answer is based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the translated text `""Bonjour comment allez-vous?""` matching the API response. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved."

The model invoked the tool `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` with the arguments `{""country_code"":""US"",""date"":""2022-12-31""}`. This matches the required API call `get_info_day_for_working_days` with the arguments `{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""}`. The tool name and arguments are correct, and the additional parameters in the actual tool call (e.g., `get_1_3_` prefix) do not affect the correctness. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**:  
The model provided the final answer: ""The date '2022-12-31' is a weekend day in the US and not a working day."" This answer is based on the API response, which indicated that the date is a weekend day. The response correctly fulfills the user's instruction to provide information about the validity and nature of the date. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.

This matches the required API call `analyse_for_working_days` with the arguments `{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US""}`. The tool name and arguments are correct, so Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the API response, stating the number of working days and listing the public holidays for the specified period in the US. The response aligns with the data retrieved from the API call, and it fulfills the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved."
4,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me the review of the app with the ID 1053012309 and search for the app with the name 'clash of clans'?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}`. However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model are `get_app_reviews_for_ios_store` and `search_for_ios_store`, which do not match the required tool call. Since the model did not invoke the required tool call, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, as there is no `give_answer` return type in the provided data. The model chose to ""give up and restart,"" which means it did not fulfill the user's instruction.  

In summary, the model failed to invoke the required API call and did not provide a valid final answer, resulting in failures for both objectives."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` with the arguments `{""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""start_time"": ""08:15"", ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""}`. This matches the required API call `add_working_hours_for_working_days` with the arguments `{""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""start_time"": ""08:15"", ""increment_time"": 2004}`. The tool name and all required arguments are correct, and the additional parameter `""increment_time"": ""2004:00""` does not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer: ""After adding 2004 working hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '08:15', the resulting date and time is '2014-12-30' at '14:15'."" This answer is based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the tool response `{""end_date"": ""2014-12-30"", ""end_time"": ""14:15""}`. The final answer correctly achieves the user's instruction, and it is derived from the API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `get_addresses_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{}`.  
2. `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{}`.  
3. `get_quota_usage_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{}`.  
4. `get_service_status_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{}`.  

The model did not provide the required argument `monitorAddressId` for the `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` tool call. Therefore, the required API call was not executed correctly, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model's final response does not directly address the user's instruction based on the required API call. The response discusses the service status and quota usage but does not provide the expected information related to the `monitorAddressId` specified in the required API call. Thus, the response is not derived from the required API data, further confirming the failure for Objective 3."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked only one tool: `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with the argument `{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}`. However, the required API calls include both `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with the argument `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}` and `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with the argument `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`. Since the model did not invoke the `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` tool, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. However, even if we disregard Objective 2, the final answer provided by the model does not directly fulfill the user's instruction. The user asked for a valid IP address to check, but the model's final response focused on the properties of the IP address `8.8.8.8` (e.g., cloud and hosting services) rather than confirming its validity or providing a new valid IP address. Thus, the final answer does not align with the user's request, making Objective 3 a failure."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked only one tool: `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`. However, the required API calls include both `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}` and `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`. Since the model did not invoke the `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` tool, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model, ""The IP address 8.8.8.8 is detected as a cloud and hosting service..."", is based solely on the response from the `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` tool. However, the required API calls include another tool (`legacy_v1_for_blackbox`) that was not invoked, meaning the final answer is incomplete and not fully derived from all required API calls. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked only one tool, `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data`, with the argument `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`. However, the required API calls include three tools: `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data`, `artist_overview_for_spotify_data`, and `artist_albums_for_spotify_data`, all with the argument `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`. The model failed to invoke the other two required tools (`artist_overview_for_spotify_data` and `artist_albums_for_spotify_data`), and the `is_id` argument in the invoked tool does not match the expected value. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it stated, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" which indicates that the model failed to achieve the user's instruction based on the API data.  

In summary, the model failed to invoke all required tools with the correct arguments (Objective 2) and did not provide a valid final answer based on the API data (Objective 3)."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:** The model invoked only one tool: `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with the argument `{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}`. However, the required API calls include two tools: `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with the argument `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}` and `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with the argument `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`. The model failed to invoke the second required tool (`artist_overview_for_spotify_data`), and the argument for the first tool (`is_id`) does not match the required value. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model's final response states, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" which indicates that the model did not provide a valid answer based on the API data. This further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
