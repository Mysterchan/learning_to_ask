Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.football_score_api: Get football live scores for today be it any match The scores are divided based on the league and you can fetch the data for all the leagues This also gives you flexibility to know and find the matches and scores between teams for any other given date as well\n"
