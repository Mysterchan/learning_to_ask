1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The tools invoked by the model:  
  1. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `""{ \""trackingnumber\"": \""YT9999999999\"" }""`  
  2. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `""{ \""trackingnumber\"": \""YT9999999999\"" }""`  

- The required API calls:  
  1. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments:  
     ""{ \""trackingNumber\"": \""YT2003521266065328\"" }""  
  2. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments:  
     ""{ \""trackingNumber\"": \""YT2003521266065328\"" }""  

Comparison:  
The tool names are correctly invoked, but the argument value ""`trackingnumber\"":\""YT9999999999\""`"" does not match the required tracking number ""`trackingNumber\"":\""YT2003521266065328\""`."" Additionally, while minor argument mismatches in key names could have been interpreted correctly semantically (e.g., ""`trackingNumber`"" to ""`trackingnumber`""), the spelling and content of the tracking number value must match exactly, which it doesn't. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the final response provided by the model references ""`YT9999999999`,"" which is inconsistent with the required argument of ""`YT2003521266065328`,"" making the response invalid with respect to the user's original instruction."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",32,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:** For Objective 2, the required tool calls involve:  
1. **`packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`** with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`
2. **`carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`** with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

The essential API calls are focused on **`trackingnumber` = ""YT2003521266065328""**. However, in the actual tool calls made by the model, the `trackingnumber` used throughout is `""NY9999999990""`, which does *not* match the expected `trackingnumber` (""YT2003521266065328""). The use of a mismatched argument indicates that the crucial condition for the accuracy of Objective 2 is not met.  

For Objective 3, because the correct APIs with the required arguments were not invoked (Objective 2 failed), and the final response revolves around inaccurate or unfulfilled API operations, the objective directly fails. The model's final interactions also indicate it ""gave up and restarted"" without producing a concrete result based on the required queries, further affirming its failure in achieving the user's instruction."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  

1. **Objective 2**: The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
    - **`get_similar_apps_for_ios_store`** with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`
    - **`get_ios_app_for_ios_store`** with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`
    - Additional unnecessary tools: **`search_for_ios_store`** and **`Finish`**
   
   The **required API calls** are:
    - **`get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store`** with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`
    - **`get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store`** with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`
   
   The mismatched detail resides in the argument `""is_id""`, where the model used `""1053012309""` instead of the required `""1053012308""`. Because these values are explicitly specified and do not semantically align, the tool calls fail to meet the requirements for correctness. As a result, Objective 2 is a failure.

2. **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. The model's final answer, `""The app with ID 1053012309 could not be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide a list of similar apps or details about this app.""`, relied on data retrieved from incorrect API calls (with the mismatched ""is_id""). Furthermore, the required user intent involved the app with ID `""1053012308""`, which the API calls did not address, so the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}`. However, the actual tool invoked by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, which does not match the required API call. Since the expected tool was not invoked, Objective 2 is a failure.  
For Objective 3, the model did not handle the user's request or retrieve any information using the required tool, but instead gave up and chose to restart, which fails to satisfy the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",7,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call is `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` with the argument `""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""`. However, none of the actual tool calls made by the model included this API call. Instead, the model invoked other tools such as `get_addresses_for_address_monitor`, `get_service_status_for_address_monitor`, and `get_quota_usage_for_address_monitor`. There is no match to the required API call, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as the expected data from the required API call wasn't retrieved to fulfill the user's instructions. Moreover, the provided final answer deviated entirely from the required API context (`get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor`) and instead addressed the monitoring status and arguments based on other tools, which does not fulfill the user's request."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, we compare the required and actual tool calls:  
- **Expected tool calls**:  
  1. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`  
  2. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`  

- **Actual tool calls (model's invocation)**:  
  1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`  
   
While the second required tool call is invoked correctly (`singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with the expected arguments `{ ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`), the `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` tool call is entirely missing from the model's actions. Since the model failed to invoke all required API calls, **Objective 2 is a failure**.   

For **Objective 3**, as previously stated: ""If Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure."" Moreover, although the final answer attempts to provide a judgment about the IP address, it does so based on incomplete API tool usage. This leads to an invalid reliance on incomplete data, resulting in failure for Objective 3."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls are:  
1. `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`.  
2. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`.  

The only tool call the model made was:  
- `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`.  

While the second required tool call matches exactly with the model's actual usage, the model failed to invoke the required `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` tool. This makes Objective 2 a failure, as one of the mandatory API calls was not invoked.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
The failure in Objective 2 directly implies a failure in Objective 3, as all required tools were not invoked. Thus, the final answer may not be fully accurate or complete based on all necessary API data.

8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",33,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls were:  
  1. `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
  2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
  3. `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
- The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
  1. `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}` and later with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.<br>The correct one for this tool matches the expected API call.  
  2. `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` with arguments: both `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}` (incorrect) and later correctly with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  
  3. `artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data` instead of `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` was called for overview information. This tool does not match the name specified in the required API call.  

Although partial matches were made, the mismatch in tool name (`artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data` used instead of `artist_overview_for_spotify_data`) results in failure for Objective 2 according to the criteria.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as the necessary tool aligned with the requirement (`artist_overview_for_spotify_data`) was not called, and the final answer relies on incomplete or inaccurate data despite model efforts to provide detailed responses. The provided final answer uses data retrieved from some API invocations but is insufficient to fully address the user request due to the missing necessary response concerning terms such as ""overview"" data."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",41,4,Success,Success,Success,"The model was required to make the following API calls:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  

The model's actual API calls include:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}` (Correct match!).  
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}` (Correct match!).  

Since both required API calls were invoked correctly and aligned with the specified arguments, the evaluation of Objective 2 is a success.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The model presented the final response with relevant information about the artist ?œINNA??using details retrieved via the API calls. The final answer provided details, including playlists and descriptions related to the artist, directly matching the information derived from the API responses. Specifically:  
- Playlists such as **Summer Dance Hits 2024**, **Hits du Moment**, and **INNA X Gamuel Sori - Party Songs** were presented based on the API data.  
- All presented detailed artist information and playlist cover art were derived explicitly from valid API calls.  

Hence, the user's instruction was fulfilled, and the derived final answer was indeed based on API outputs, ensuring a success for Objective 3."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",8,0,Success,Success,Success,"### Reason: 

#### Objective 2: Success
- **Expected Tool Calls**:  
  - `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with `{'channelname': 'mrbeast'}`
  - `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with `{'channelid': 'UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA'}`  

- **Actual Tool Calls**:  
  1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{'channelname': 'mrbeast'}`  
  2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{'channelid': 'UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA'}`  

The invoked tools match the expected tools in terms of both the *tool names* and the *arguments*. Any retries or unnecessary intermediate calls are irrelevant as per the evaluation guidelines.  

#### Objective 3: Success  
- **User Instruction:** The user seeks details about the YouTube channel ""mrbeast"".  
- **Final Answer Given by Model:**  
  - Provide information about ""mrbeast"" such as the channel ID, avatar resolutions, banner resolutions, and other details (verified).  

The final response fulfills the user's need and was informed by the retrieved API data:  
The `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` call correctly identified the channel ID for ""mrbeast"", and the subsequent `channel_details_for_youtube_search` call provided the specific channel details. Critically, the final formatted answer (containing the resolved avatar and banner image resolutions and channel metadata) directly uses this API-acquired data, achieving the user's request effectively."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
`'validate_email_for_validate_email'` with arguments `'{ ""email"": ""test@gmail.com"" }'`.  

The model invoked the tool:  
`'validate_email_for_validate_email'` with arguments `'{""email"":""test@gmail.com""}'`.  

The tool name matches the required name exactly, and the argument `""email"": ""test@gmail.com""` matches the expected argument. Therefore, the model executed the required tool calls correctly, satisfying Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the final answer provided by the model is:  
""The email address test@gmail.com is valid. The validation results are as follows:  
- Regex Validation: True  
- Typo Validation: True  
- Disposable Validation: True  
- MX Validation: True  
- SMTP Validation: True""  

This answer is derived from the tool's response, which validated the email `test@gmail.com` and provided the validation details. The final answer is accurate and fully satisfies the user's instruction to validate the email's validity and provide the results. Thus, Objective 3 is also satisfied."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the expected tool call is `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with arguments `{""date"":""19870630""}`. The actual tool call made by the model is:  
1. `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{""date"":""19870630""}`.  

The tool name and required argument align properly with the expected tool call. Additional tools like `usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator` and `Finish` were invoked but were not part of the required tools. Such additional unnecessary tools do not affect the success of the evaluation as the required API call was both invoked and correct. Therefore, **Objective 2** is successful.

For **Objective 3**, the model provided the final answer: ""Based on the date of birth 19870630, your age is 37 years. The calculation was done using the US/Eastern time zone. Here are some available time zones: ..."". This final answer correctly fulfills the user instruction and is based on the data retrieved from the tool calls, particularly the response of `age_calculator_for_age_calculator`. Since it is explicitly derived from the API response and fulfills the user's requirement, **Objective 3** is also successful."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,8,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
1. **Required API Calls**:  
   - `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}`  
   - `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}`  
   - `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}`  

2. **Actual API Calls Invoked by the Model**:  
   - `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""type"": ""video"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""maxresults"": 5}`  
   - `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""WhwasfKS12E"", ""part"": ""snippet,statistics""}` (focused on a suggested video, not the original video ID).  
   - `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""videoid"": ""WhwasfKS12E"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": 5}` (focused on a suggested video, not the original video ID).  

3. Issues with Compliance:  
   a. The arguments for the `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` tool do not match fully. The required API call specifies `""part"": ""id,snippet""` and `""maxresults""` is missing in the expected call, while it is present in the actual API call. `""type"": ""video""` is correct. However, the argument `""id,snippet""` is required and was incorrectly specified as `""snippet""` in the actual tool invocation.  
   b. For `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2`, the required call specifies looking for `""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""` for the ID `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`. Instead, the actual argument retrieves `""snippet,statistics""` for `""WhwasfKS12E""`, which is not the ID specified in the requirements.  
   c. For the `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`, the expected API call should have fetched comments for `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`, but the actual tool call retrieves comments for `""WhwasfKS12E""`. Additionally, the expected `maxresults` is `""100""` but the actual call provides `5`.

Because the tool calls do not fully align with all the **required arguments**, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

---

For Objective 3:  
The final user's intention is to provide details and comments for a song using the specified video ID `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`. The model retrieves the details and comments for a **different video ID (`WhwasfKS12E`)**, rather than using information from the expected inputs. Since this doesn't achieve the user's instruction and is based on misaligned API calls, Objective 3 is also a **failure**."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,87,13,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
**Actual tool calls made by the model:**  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""part"": ""snippet"", ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""maxresults"": ""5""}'`  
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  

**Expected API Calls:**  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  

**Comparison:**  

For the tool `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'`:  
- The `playlistid` matches (`""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`).  
- The required `part` argument matches (""snippet"").  
- Other parameter differences, such as the extra argument `""maxresults"": ""5""`, do not affect the correctness.  

For the tool `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'`:  
- The tool name matches.  
- The expected and passed arguments (`""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`, `""part"": ""snippet""`) align exactly.  

Based on this comparison, **all required API calls were invoked correctly**, leading to a **success** for Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The final output provided by the assistant reads:  
> ""Given that previous attempts to fetch the playlist details and videos have failed, it seems the playlist ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX' might be incorrect or the playlist might not exist...""  
> ""Alternatively, would you like to search for animated movie playlists on YouTube using a keyword (e.g., 'animated movie') instead?...""   

This response:  
1. **Fails to correctly address the user's instruction** because it neither summarizes nor uses the valid API responses concerning `""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`.  
2. Mentions toolset or user-related issues (e.g., an incorrect ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"" playlist ID), although the last `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` response for `""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""` was valid, and earlier valid results included video details and corresponding comments related to `""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`.  
3. Departs from directly leveraging these valid results to achieve, complete, or summarize the user's query.  

This shows the final answer was **not derived effectively** from the data retrieved and completely fails to fulfill the user's instructions. Thus, Objective 3 is deemed a **failure**. 

Note: Since Objective 2 succeeded, Objective 3 results remain independently evaluated."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
Objective 2: The tool call invoked by the model was:  
- `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 10}'`.  
  
The required API calls were:  
- `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{""user_id"": ""96479162""}'`.  
- `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{""user_id"": ""96479162""}'`.  
  
The tool name `user_s_followers_for_twitter` matches one of the required tool names. However, the `user_id` argument in the actual tool call is `""987654321""`, which does not match the required `user_id` of `""96479162""`. Additionally, the required API call for `user_s_likes_for_twitter` was never invoked by the model. Due to these reasons, Objective 2 does not meet the expectations and is a failure.  

Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is a failure."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,57,11,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
1. The expected tool call is `user_details_for_twitter` with arguments `{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}`. However, this tool call does not appear anywhere in the actual tool calls made by the model. Instead, the model invoked tools such as `search_for_twitter` and `hashtag_for_twitter` multiple times, but none aligned with the required tool call. Thus, the tool execution was not aligned with expectations, leading to failure for Objective 2.

2. Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, the final answer does not fulfill the user's original request, as there is no attempt to answer or retrieve data for the required `username`. Thus, the user's instruction has not been completed based on tool calls or retrieved data."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3' with arguments '{""search"": ""google.com""}'` was not invoked by the model. Instead, the model invoked the same tool with arguments `""search"": ""wikimania.org""`, which does not match the expected argument `""google.com""`. As a result, Objective 2 is a failure. Because Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model provided a final answer that was irrelevant to the required instruction since it catered to information about ""wikimania.org"" instead of ""google.com""."

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The user's instruction to retrieve the Fear and Greed Index for a specific past date (`2024-06-01`) was not achieved. The model erroneously targeted future dates (`2025-06-01` and `2025-06-15`) and provided a final answer focusing on future values not being available without addressing the expected past date data. Consequently, the user's request was not fulfilled."

The required API call is `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`. However, the model invoked several `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` tool calls, and the target date `""2024-02-18""` is missing from the query arguments for all of them. Instead, the model called this tool with `""date"": ""2024-02-29""`, `""2025-02-28""`, `""2024-02-28""`, and other invalid or irrelevant dates such as `""2025-02-29""`. Since the required API call to fetch data for the specific `""2024-02-18""` day was never executed, Objective 2 fails. Consequently, the final answer is also invalid as it does not fulfill the user?™s instruction (related to the required date), and therefore Objective 3 also fails."

- 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments: '{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'.  

However, the actual tool calls the model invoked are:  
1. 'index_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments: '{}'.
  
This means the required tool name 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' was never invoked, and the arguments do not match either. Due to this mismatch, Objective 2 is a failure.  

As per the rules, if Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Therefore, without verifying the relation between the final response and the API information, Objective 3 is also a failure."

   This indicates that the tool call `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` was not invoked at all, leading to a failure in Objective 2.  

2. For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure (the required tool call was not made), we can directly infer that the user's instruction was not achieved, and therefore Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final response indicates that the system ""chose to give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's instruction."

I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are as follows:  
1. `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}`  
2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`  

The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""90068472""}`.  

Analysis:  
- The tool name `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` matches one of the required API calls, but the argument provided (`is_id: ""90068472""`) does not match the required value (`is_id: ""80057281""`).  
- The tool `title_details_for_netflix_data` was not invoked.  
Thus, the required API calls were not properly addressed. This leads to a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails regardless of the returned answer. However:  
- The model provided a final answer stating that no trailers are available for the title ID `90068472`. This ID does not align with the required ID `80057281`, indicating further failure in achieving the user's instruction.  
Thus, Objective 3 fails."

Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",16,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
  - The **Required API Calls** are:
    1. `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}`
    2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`

    2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""90068472""}`
  
  Upon comparison:
  - Both required tools are invoked, but the argument value `""is_id"": ""80057281""` in the required API call doesn't match the value `""is_id"": ""90068472""` as used by the model. The same mismatch (""80057281"" vs. ""90068472"") exists for the `title_details_for_netflix_data` call as well. This discrepancy means neither tool call satisfies the requirements entirely.
  
  Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  
  
- **Objective 3:**  
  Since Objective 2 failed (invalid tool calls), Objective 3 automatically fails as per the evaluation rules. Moreover:  
  - The final response acknowledges that the task cannot be completed. While the final answer matches the model's subsequent API responses, observing this result is irrelevant because the required API calls were not fulfilled correctly to begin with. 

Thus, both objectives fail."
24,"My company is launching a new website.

2. `'name': 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro', 'arguments': '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'`

The actual tool calls by the model were:  

- `'name': 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro', 'arguments': '{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}'`  

Observations:  
- While the tool name for one of the tool invocations matches (`domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`), the argument does not match, as the expected website is ""getecz.com"", but the model used ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net"" instead.
- Additionally, the model entirely missed invoking the second required tool: `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'`, meaning one required API call was not fulfilled.

This comparison indicates the **Objective 2** is a failure.

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 already failed and the required tools were not adequately invoked, we can directly infer the final response for the user cannot be based on the correct retrieved data. Moreover:
- The model's final answer states: `""The domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net does not exist in the whois database...""`, but this reasoning is based on the incorrect website `""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""` being used, which does not fulfill the user's instruction regarding the correct target website `""getecz.com""`.
- The failure to utilize mandatory tool(s) also means **Objective 3** is a failure, as the issue affects completing the original task based on accurate API responses."

For Objective 2:
- **Tool Invoked by the Model**: `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`.
- **Expected Tool Call**: `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{\n  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",\n  ""variable"": ""x""\n }`.
- The tool name and required arguments match perfectly between the actual tool call and the expected API call. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:
- The model used the response from the tool: `""3 + 4*x""` for the differentiation result.
- It then explicitly provided the final answer `""The derivative of the expression '2*x^2 + 3*x + 1' with respect to 'x' is '3 + 4*x'.""`, which correctly fulfills the user's instruction and is derived directly from the tool's response. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."

For Objective 2, the required API call is `{'name': 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', 'arguments': '{\n  ""term"": ""onomatopoeia""\n }'}`.  
The model invoked the tool `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with arguments `{""term"":""onomatopoeia""}`. This matches the expected tool in both name and argument. Additional tools (`Finish`) called are irrelevant and do not affect correctness as per the evaluation rules. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model provided a comprehensive final response: `""The word 'onomatopoeia' refers to the formation of words that imitate natural sounds. Examples include words like 'croak', 'sizzle', and 'splash'..."".` This response fulfills the user?™s request to clarify whether they meant ""onomatopoeia"" (spelled correctly) and provides detailed information and examples from the Urban Dictionary API's responses. As the final answer is derived from the API output and satisfies the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a success."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:

  ```
  The additional `""language""` parameter does not affect the API call's correctness or intent and is acceptable. Additionally, there were no spelling mistakes or invalid argument mappings. The expected tool call was successfully matched. Hence, Objective 2 is marked as a success.

- **Objective 3**: The final response reflects the information retrieved?”namely, the exchange rate extracted from the tool's response (`0.0062 EUR per 1 JPY`) and the subsequent calculated 1000 JPY to EUR equivalent (`6.2 EUR`). This response directly fulfills the user?™s instruction and depends on the API data for its computation. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."

The actual tool call made by the model included the function call `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""kleido007""}'`. They match exactly, satisfying Objective 2.  

- For Objective 3: The final response provided by the model includes valid extracted information gathered directly from the necessary API call response for `'kleido007'`. It acknowledges the previously failed attempts for `'hugo1232fesfgerwt'` correctly and proceeds with retrieving and presenting the accurate data for `'kleido007'`.

31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",9,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2**:  
  The model invoked the following tool call:  
  `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`  

  The required API call was:
  `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`  

  Both the tool name and argument are correct, thus satisfying the requirement. Even though there are additional tool calls (irrelevant ones like `get_categories_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`, etc.), they don?™t affect the correctness of Objective 2 as all expected tool calls were made accurately.  

- **For Objective 3**:  
  The final answer provided by the model includes the information retrieved from tools invoked, specifically reflecting data fetched via the `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` tool (for `""kleido007""`).  
  The explanation in the final answer summarizes the retrieved user profile and acknowledges API/server errors during its query execution (e.g., `""The server encountered an internal error""` for other APIs). This confirms that the final response relies on data/api results, fulfilling the user's request as much as the situation permits. Hence, Objective 3 is also satisfied."

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `{""url"": ""8394725634879021564""}` (several such calls were made repeatedly with this incorrect URL).  
2. `'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `{""cursor"": ""0"", ""count"": ""10"", ""music_id"": ""8394725634879021564""}`.  

**Comparison:**  
- The argument `""url""` required in the first API call differs between the expected (`""7002634556977908485""`) and the actual API calls (`""8394725634879021564""`). The argument is critical, and the mismatch indicates a failure in mapping the correct URL.  
- For the second API call, the `""music_id""` as well as `""count""` do not match the expected arguments. `""count""` was expected to be `""20""` but the actual tool call used `""10""`, and `""music_id""` provided was `""8394725634879021564""` instead of the required `""7002634556977908485""`. The mismatches in values signify that the model did not fulfill the required API call specifications.

Since the required API calls were not correctly invoked, **Objective 2 is a failure.**

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
The model failed in Objective 2 (it did not make the correct tool calls to gather the necessary data). Following the timeline of its responses:  
1. The model repeatedly encountered issues parsing data from the tool responses (invalid URL errors).  
2. The final response either requested additional details from the user about the music or concluded with a message citing the limitations in solving the query. Hence, the model failed to provide a solution that achieved the user's goal.  

Conclusively, without correct API data and a resolution, **Objective 3 is a failure.**"
33,"I need to analyze the engagement of a TikTok user's followers. Can you retrieve the follower list for a user with the ID '64556346745'? Also, fetch the user information for these followers.",45,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"However, none of the tool calls made by the model used the correct tool name `'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video'`. Instead, the model invoked tools such as `'user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video'`, which focus on followers instead of following lists, and `'get_user_info_for_tiktok_download_video'`. This mismatch between the required API call and actual tool calls negatively affects the criterium for Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure (the required API call was not attempted), Objective 3 also fails automatically because the user's request (`get_user_following_list`) was not accurately addressed or fulfilled using the expected response derived from the required API. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer aligning with the goal of the required API call but continued to perform unrelated attempts (like fetching user follower lists), culminating in a limitation acknowledgment (""Due to the limitation of toolset...""). This indicates the user's request to retrieve the following list was not resolved."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",9,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- For Objective 2:  
  The required API calls are:  
  1. `'get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"": ""xqc""}'`  
  2. `'get_stream_views_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"": ""xqc""}'`  
  3. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"": ""xqc""}'`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model are (relevant ones for ""xqc""):  
  1. `'get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"": ""xqc""}'`  
  2. `'get_stream_views_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"": ""xqc""}'`  
  3. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"": ""xqc""}'`  

  All required tools were invoked successfully with the expected arguments. The inclusion of other API calls related to ""dfasagergs"" that do not correspond to the expected ones does not undermine the success of Objective 2 as per Evaluation Rule #4.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The model provided the final answer: `""The streamer 'dfasagergs' does not exist or the data is unavailable.""` This answer aligns with the retrieved API responses which indicate that ""dfasagergs"" does not exist (response contained user set to `None`). The model efficiently utilized the accessed API data to conclude this. Furthermore, for the streamer ""xqc,"" the required API calls have been executed to fetch the required data correctly, showing the process satisfies the expected user instructions. Thus, the user's query is successfully resolved by accurate reliance on the tool responses."
35,Find the streamer 'shadoune66666' streamer's info.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call `{ 'name': 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""channel"": ""shadoune666""\n }' }` matches the actual tool call by the model `{ 'name': 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api', 'arguments': '{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}' }`. The tool name matches, and the argument `""channel"": ""shadoune666""` is identical in intention and content, fulfilling the requirement even if minor format differences (like whitespaces) are present.  

For Objective 3, the final answer `The streamer 'shadoune666' has the following info: User ID is '36533048', login is 'shadoune666', and currently there is no active stream.` is drawn directly from the API response, specifically from `{ 'login': 'shadoune666', 'id': '36533048', 'stream': None }`. Since the given final answer fulfills the requirement and is consistent with the retrieved API data, it is accurate and fulfills the user's instruction."

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 is also a failure. The products list retrieved by the additional tool call (`'products_list_for_kohls'`) was not specifically related to the user's query (UPC identification with the value `194574942221`). Furthermore, the final response acknowledged that the question could not be solved due to tool limitations, thus not achieving the user's instruction."
37,"I'm redecorating my home and looking for furniture options. Can you list the available furniture products on Kohls? Also, provide me with the product reviews for a specific product with webID 5372023.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- Expected API call:  
  `{'name': 'reviews_list_for_kohls', 'arguments': '{ ""productid"": ""4201989"" }'}`  
- Actual API calls made by the model:  
  1. `{'name': 'categories_list_for_kohls', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
  2. `{'name': 'reviews_list_for_kohls', 'arguments': '{""productid"": ""5372023"", ""limit"": 5}'}`  
  3. `{'name': 'products_list_for_kohls', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
- The tool call for `'reviews_list_for_kohls'` was expected but involved a different product ID (`""4201989""` expected vs `""5372023""` used). Hence, the argument does not match, so this tool call is incorrect. Furthermore, unnecessary additional tools (`categories_list_for_kohls`, `products_list_for_kohls`) were invoked, but these do not impact the evaluation. Failure occurs because the required API call was not accurately invoked.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly fails. Beyond this, the final answer provided (""I was unable to find specific furniture products or reviews for the product with webID 5372023..."") is not based on fulfilling the user's expected request, because the correct product ID (""4201989"") was not used during the tool invocation. Therefore, the user's instruction was not achieved."
38,"I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this product, including images, pricing, and customer reviews?",30,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required tools and their arguments include:  
1. `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`  
2. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`  

The actual tool calls include various requests but fail to invoke the `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` API as required. Alternatively, the `'products_search_for_wayfair'` API is invoked multiple times with arguments `{""keyword"": ""W003247135""}` and similar variations (`filters, itemsperpage, etc.`), but this is **not an equivalent substitution for `products_detail_for_wayfair`.** Additionally, `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` is invoked several times but includes extraneous arguments (`sort_order` such as `""HELPFUL""` or `""DATE_DESCENDING""`) that can diverge from the required basic call with only the `""sku""` argument.

Since one of the required API calls is missing and deviations/change in required arguments make the invocation inadequate for `reviews_list_for_wayfair`, **this leads to failure for Objective 2.**

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 also results in a failure as the required APIs were not invoked correctly. Moreover, the model's final content states an inability to solve the query due to limitation of the toolset and redirects the user to check the Wayfair website or customer service instead of providing the requested details. This clearly shows that the user's instruction was not achieved.  

Thus, both objectives failed."

However, the tools invoked by the model are:

This tool was invoked twice, but the expected tool call `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` was not invoked at all. This constitutes a failure for Objective 2 since one of the required API calls was completely missing.  

Given that Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can directly be inferred as a failure since the required API calls were not adequately executed to fulfill the user's request. The model stated that it could not resolve the user's query, which demonstrates that the instruction was not achieved."

2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

The tool names (`get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` and `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`) and the arguments (`productId` vs. `productid`) are correct despite minor naming differences, as the intention matches entirely. Therefore, Objective 2 is successful.  

For Objective 3, the final answer is:  
```
The product **Coffret intÃ©grale harry potter [Blu-ray]** has an average rating of 4.7 based on 6,421 reviews. It is priced at $80.98 with free shipping and is currently in stock, usually shipping within 4 to 5 days. The product is sold by **7th ART** and is not fulfilled by Amazon. For more details, you can visit the [product page](https://www.amazon.com/Coffret-int%C3%A9grale-harry-potter-Blu-ray/dp/B00K3OM3PS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8).  
```

This answer is accurate and synthesized based on valid data retrieved from the following invoked tools:  
- The first tool (`get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`) provided average rating data which was included in the response.  
- The second tool (`get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`) provided pricing, stock status, and seller details which were incorporated into the answer.  

The model correctly queries all the required tools and derives the answer entirely from API responses. Thus, Objective 3 is also successful."

42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- Tool name: `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`  
- Arguments: `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:  
1. Tool name: `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`  
   Arguments: `{""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""}` (first attempt).  

2. Tool name: `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`  
   Arguments: `{""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""}` (after restarting).  

Observing the arguments, the model uses `""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""` rather than the required field `""is_id"":""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`. This deviation results in **Failure for Objective 2** because the argument is not semantically or syntactically correct compared to the expected input. The tool name is correct, but an incorrectly spelled argument invalidates the tool calls.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed (incorrect API call arguments used), we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. Additionally, inspecting the final answer provided by the model (""The request to the API has timed out...""), it seems to correspond to the API response output rather than truly fulfilling the user's requirement (i.e., obtaining details for the specific race based on the required ID). However, as already stated in the rules, malfunction at Objective 2 renders Objective 3 irrelevant."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,8,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
-The expected API call was:  
  `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`.  

-The model's actual API calls were:
1. `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""}` (invoked twice, but with an incorrect ID).
2. `race_list_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{}` (unnecessary call).
3. `select_race_based_on_race_number_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{""race_no"": ""1""}`(unnecessary and tries an alternative solution).  

  The invoked tool `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` has a mismatch in the argument value for ""is_id."" The expected value was `""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`, but the provided value was `""d27e0de553b9d7""`, which was incorrect. Given that this inappropriate ID was used, the required API call was never successfully executed as expected. This results in **failure for Objective 2** because the tool call was inaccurate.  

-Given failure in Objective 2, we can directly infer failure for Objective 3. Additionally, while the model eventually figured out portion of its instruction requirements involving race number `""1""`, this information was derived through a workaround. However, invoking the additional tools (`race_list_for_f1_race_schedule` and `select_race_based_on_race_number_for_f1_race_schedule`) was unnecessary and violates the instructions for using *only* the `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` tool. Therefore, its final response was not robustly and directly dependent on the specifically required tool, further confirming failure for Objective 3."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not invoke any tool call, as indicated by the absence of any actual tool calls (`'tool_calls': None`) in the content provided. However, there was a required API call: `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments `'{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}'`, which was not executed by the model. As Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails directly since there is no final answer provided based on API calls, and the user's requirement is not fulfilled."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

For Objective 2:
- **Actual Tool Call by the Model:** `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments `'{""name"": ""riven""}'`.
- **Expected Tool Call:** `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments: `'{""name"": ""riven""}'`. 
 
The tool name and required arguments match exactly between the actual tool call and the expected tool call. This indicates the API call was correctly executed. Additional checks reveal that there were no discrepancies or missing tools.

For Objective 3:
- The final answer fulfills the user's request by correctly retrieving and referencing the necessary data from the API response. The base stats of the champion ""Riven"" were correctly formed for the final response based precisely on the API call response. There is no incorrect information, and the model explicitly used the API response for fulfilling the user's instruction."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
`'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data'` with arguments `'{ ""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V"",""country"":""US""}'`.  

The required tool call is  
`'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data'` with arguments `'{ ""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'`.  

The tool name is correct, and while there is an additional parameter (`""country"":""US""`), this does not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the final answer provided:  
`""The product details for ASIN B07ZPKBL9V are as follows:  
- Product Title: Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, (PRODUCT)RED - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)  
- Price: $208.00  
- Currency: USD` *(additional details reported in full above.)*  

The response directly used data retrieved from the API call response. The user's instruction was fulfilled as details of the ASIN provided matching the tool execution output. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"`{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"", ""toLang"":""fr""}'}`  
The tool invoked by the model is:  
`{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"":""fr""}'}`  
The tool name is correct, and the argument ""toLang"" in the required API call matches ""tolang"" in the model's actual invocation as they both semantically mean the target language, which is French. Thus, the tool call satisfies the criteria above for accuracy.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final answer provided by the model is:  
`""The translation of 'Hello, how are you?' to French ('fr') is 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'.""`  
This answer is correct according to the response from the `translate_for_translate_all_languages` tool call, where the response indicates that the translated text of `""Hello, how are you?""` to French is `""Bonjour comment allez-vous?""`. The model effectively used the API result to generate the user's desired response, fulfilling the user's instruction."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the tool `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` with arguments `{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""}`. The required API call was `get_info_day_for_working_days` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""country_code"": ""US"",
  ""date"": ""2022-12-31""
}
```  
The tool name is slightly different (`get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` vs. `get_info_day_for_working_days`), but this discrepancy is acceptable as stated in the rule since it carries out the same function. The arguments also match exactly. Therefore, **Objective 2 succeeded**.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model is:  
*""The date '2022-12-31' is a weekend day in the US and not a working day.""*  

This answer aligns with the data retrieved from the tool invocation, which indicates the date was a weekend day (`weekend_day: 1`). The model's response addresses the user's question based explicitly on the obtained tool data. Hence, **Objective 3 also succeeded**."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"- `'analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments: `{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US""}`  

The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
- `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments: `{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US""}`  

The tool names, though slightly truncated or prefixed in a technical way, are contextually equivalent. Additionally, the arguments provided match perfectly with no spelling or semantic differences. Therefore, all key criteria are satisfied, and Objective 2 is a success.

---

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason**: The final answer provided is:  
`""The period from 2013-01-01 to 2013-12-31 in the US includes 251 working days and 10 public holidays. The public holidays during this period are: New Year?™s Day (2013-01-01), Martin Luther King Day (2013-01-21), President?™s Day (2013-02-18), Memorial Day (2013-05-27), Independence Day (2013-07-04), Labor Day (2013-09-02), Columbus Day (2013-10-14), Veterans Day (2013-11-11), Thanksgiving Day (2013-11-28), and Christmas Day (2013-12-25).""`  

This answer is directly based on the response from the tool call, which provides a detailed breakdown of working days and public holidays with their respective details. The answer is accurate, fulfills the user's instruction, and reflects the retrieved API data explicitly. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Expected Tool Call**: `'add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
    ""country_code"": ""US"",
    ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
    ""increment_time"": 2004
  }
  ```
  
- **Actual Tool Call**: `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
    ""country_code"": ""US"",
    ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
    ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""
  }
  ```

While the tool name is partially correct (`add_working_hours_for_working_days` is referred to but prefixed/truncated as `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'`), the discrepancy lies in the argument `increment_time`, which was expected to be `2004` but was instead provided as `""2004:00""` in the actual tool call. This difference violates the requirement since it involves incorrect information. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Due to the failure of Objective 2, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is a failure as well. Specifically:
- The final answer `""After adding 2004 working hours...""` was provided, but that response relies on data from an incorrect tool call (where `increment_time` was misrepresented). Hence, the final user instruction is not properly fulfilled by accurate API-derived information."
