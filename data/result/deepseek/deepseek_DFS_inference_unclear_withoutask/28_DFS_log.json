It seems that the correct ticker symbol for Silynxcom Ltd is not available through these methods. Therefore, I need to find an alternative approach to gather the required information.\n\n### Action:\nI will try to gather the required information using a different function. I will use the `stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2` function to retrieve earnings information for Silynxcom Ltd, which might contain some relevant details about the company.\n\n### Action:\n```json\n{\"name\":\"stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"symbol\\\": \\\"SILX\\\"}\"}\n```",
