I will directly evaluate the total number of coins based on the information provided.\n\nGiven that you have 30 coins in one pocket, I will assume that the number of coins in the second pocket is also provided or can be inferred. However, since only one number (30) is provided, I will assume that the second pocket also has 30 coins for the sake of this calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of coins by adding the coins from both pockets.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total number of coins\n- Number of coins in the first pocket: 30\n- Number of coins in the second pocket: 30\n\nTotal number of coins = 30 + 30 = 60\n\n### Step 2: Provide the final answer\nThe total number of coins you have is 60.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total number of coins you have is 60.\n\n### Function Call\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Finish\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"return_type\": \"give_answer\",\n    \"final_answer\": \"The total number of coins you have is 60.\"\n  }\n}\n```",
