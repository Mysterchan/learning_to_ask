1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",20,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2:** The expected tool calls include:  
   - Tool: `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  
   - Tool: `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  

   However, the actual tool calls made by the model include multiple calls to the tools:  
   - '`packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`' with arguments containing `'{""trackingnumber"": "".YT9999999999""}'`.  
   - '`carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2 '` with similarly invalid arguments containing `'{""trackingnumber"": "".YT9999999999""}'`.  

   The expected argument (`""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""`) is not used in any of the actual tool calls?îthe tracking number in the actual calls is incorrectly formatted as "".YT9999999999"". This discrepancy indicates a mismatch in both content and format, leading to a failure in Objective 2.

2. **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, the response is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, while the final answer states that ""`The tracking number .YT9999999999 is invalid`,"" this is derived from processing only the mismatched arguments used in incorrect tool calls (e.g., `.YT9999999999`). The expected tracking number (`YT2003521266065328`) was never utilized correctly in tool calls, meaning the model did not use the provided tracking number?îwhich invalidates the final answer altogether.",,,,
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",31,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  

- Required API calls:  
  1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
  2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

- Actual API calls:  
  1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}`  
  2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}`  

The API calls made by the model have a mismatch in the argument ""trackingnumber."" While the expected value was `""YT2003521266065328""`, the model used `""NY9999999990""`, which is incorrect. Thus, the tool calls were not executed as required, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

---

For Objective 3:  

Since Objective 2 failed due to incorrect tool calls, the final response cannot be considered reliable and does not appropriately derive from the required API calls. The final user instruction cannot be considered as achieved. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure.",,,,
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool calls are as follows:  
1. `'get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
2. `'get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'get_similar_apps_for_ios_store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  
2. `'get_ios_app_for_ios_store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  

The issue here lies in the argument `""is_id""`. The required argument is `""1053012308""`, but the model instead used `""1053012309""`. Therefore, the tools were not invoked with the correct arguments, leading to a **failure in Objective 2**.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, the model's final response is based on incorrect tool call arguments. Thus, it is also a **failure in Objective 3**. The final answer, `""The app with ID 1053012309 was not found. Therefore, I cannot provide a list of similar apps or details about the app.""`, is not aligned with the required task focusing on app ID `""1053012308""`.",,,,
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
- `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}`.  

The model invoked the following tool call:  
- `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}`.  

The tool name and arguments match exactly, so Objective 2 is **successfully fulfilled**.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided the final answer as:  
""The winning number sets for Fantasy 5 between 01-01-2023 and 01-10-2023 are:  
- 01-10-2023: 3 6 17 20 30  
- 01-09-2023: 13 21 23 24 36  
- 01-08-2023: 6 10 12 16 28  
- 01-07-2023: 7 8 13 24 34  
- 01-06-2023: 3 15 16 17 34"".  

This is based directly and correctly on the data retrieved from the tool response, achieving the user's instruction to extract ""winning number sets for Fantasy 5"" for the specified dates. Therefore, **Objective 3 is also successfully fulfilled**.",,,,
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with arguments `{""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""}`. However, the actual API call invoked by the model included `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with no arguments specified. The provided model call did not include the mandatory `monitorAddressId` argument required in the expected API call. Since the model failed to produce the correct API call, Objective 2 is a failure.  

When the failure of Objective 2 occurs, we can directly infer failure for Objective 3. As per the above result, the final user's instruction wasn't executed correctly due to incomplete and incorrect API data usage. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure as well.",,,,
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2 Reasoning**:  
   - The required tool calls are:
     - `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`
     - `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`
   - The model invoked the following tools:
     - `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with `{""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""}`
     - `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with `{""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""}`
     - `'multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox'` with `{""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""}`
   - Comparison:
     - The `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` tool was invoked but with an incorrect argument (`""288.288.288.288""` instead of `""8.8.8.8""`).
     - The `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` tool was invoked but with an incorrect argument (`""288.288.288.288""` instead of `""8.8.8.8""`).
     - The `multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox` tool was invoked, but it is unnecessary based on the expected API calls, which is allowable as per the rules.
   - Since both required calls used the wrong arguments (not `""8.8.8.8""` as required), Objective 2 is judged as a failure.

2. **Objective 3 Reasoning**:
   - Since Objective 2 is already a failure, Objective 3 is automatically failed as well.
   - Additionally, the final answer provided by the model, `The IP address 288.288.288.288 is invalid and cannot be checked for cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services. Please provide a valid IP address for further analysis.`, is unrelated to the original expected calls (`8.8.8.8`). Although the IP format issue is identified, the response doesn't reference data retrieved from the required tools with proper arguments, solidifying failure for Objective 3.",,,,
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The expected API calls are:  
1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`  
2. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`  

The actual API calls made by the model are:  
1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ip"": ""288.288.288.288"" }`  
2. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ips"": ""288.288.288.288"" }`.  

The tool names match the expected tools; however, the arguments diverge. The IP in the model's API calls is `288.288.288.288`, which differs from the required IP of `8.8.8.8`. The arguments in both actual calls failed to comply with the required arguments, strictly making it a failure for Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer failure for Objective 3 as well. Moreover, the model generated a final answer, but this answer is based on API calls with incorrect arguments (`288.288.288.288` instead of `8.8.8.8`), rendering it invalid as the result is not based on the required API data.",,,,
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",64,Failure,Failure**,Failure**,"
**Reason:**  
- The **required API calls** from the expected input were as follows:  
  1. `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  
  2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  
  3. `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`

- The **actual tool calls made by the model** are largely similar in terms of function names?îfor instance:
  1. `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments containing `""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""`  
  2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments containing `""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""`  
  3. `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` with arguments containing `""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""`.

- **However, the `is_id` arguments expected (""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"") do not match the actual `is_id` passed by the model (""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2"")**. Since this is a required parameter critical to usage inputs, the discrepancy renders Objective 2 as a failure.  

  Additionally, Objective 3 fails because any final response derived from these API calls cannot be deemed valid since the model failed to provide API calls with the correct expected arguments. Furthermore, per the content available, the model gave up and did not provide a final response to fulfill the user?ôs instructions anyway (`""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""` signals failure in delivering context). Cancellation results thus apply comprehensively.",,,,
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",40,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- The expected tool calls are:  
  1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with `'{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }'`  
  2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with `'{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }'`  

- The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  Several calls, including:  
  - `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with `'{ ""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9"" }'`  
  - `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with `'{ ""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9"" }'`  
  - Several additional calls unrelated to the inputs in the required calls.  

The arguments used in the actual tool calls (`""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""`) do not match the required input arguments (`""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`). Therefore, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3:
- Since Objective 2 failed, it directly implies that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, no final concrete answer was derived that correctly relied on the API data.",,,,
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",8,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the actual tool calls by the model match all the required API calls with expected names, adjusted arguments, and operations. These are the comparisons:  

1. Actual: `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `'{""channelname"": ""MrBeast""}'`.  
   Required: `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `'{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}'`.  
   - The argument `""channelname"": ""MrBeast""` slightly differs from `""mrbeast""`, but it is semantically identical (case-insensitively matching the name input).

2. Actual: `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `'{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}'`.  
   Required: `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `'{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}'`.  
   - The arguments precisely match.

Both required API calls were made matching names and semantics. Unnecessary or incorrect prior steps (e.g., retries with wrong inputs such as ""mr.besst"") were added, but these do not disqualify the success of Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer explicitly states:  
> ""The channel ID for 'MrBeast' is 'UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA'. The available details for this channel include the avatar and banner images in various resolutions.""  

This aligns with both the proper retrieval steps and the actual responses of the tools, indicating that the model used the data from the invoked APIs effectively to accomplish user's instruction successfully.",,,,
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **For Objective 2:**  
   - **Tool invoked by the model:** `'validate_email_for_validate_email'` with arguments `{ ""email"": ""testing.com"" }`.  
   - **Required tool call:** `'validate_email_for_validate_email'` with arguments `{ ""email"": ""test@gmail.com"" }`.  
   - The tool name matches the expected one, but the argument `email` (""testing.com"") does not match the required argument (""test@gmail.com""). This mismatch causes Objective 2 to fail.  

2. **For Objective 3:**  
   - As per the instructions, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails.",,,,
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",10,Success,Failure,Failure,"- `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{""date"": ""19870630""}`  

However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{}`  
2. `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{""date"": ""99999999""}`  
3. `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{""date"": ""99999999"", ""timezone"": ""Europe/London""}`  
4. `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{""date"": ""99999999"", ""timezone"": ""US/Eastern""}`  

The arguments for all invocations to `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` do not match the required arguments (`{""date"": ""19870630""}`). Additionally, the required call was never executed. Thus, the objective of making the exact API call was not fulfilled.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Reason: A failure in Objective 2 implies the ability to achieve the user's instruction was already compromised. Furthermore:  
- The final answer (""There was an error calculating the age for the date `'99999999'`. Please check the date format or try again later."") is not based on the required input `""19870630""` and does not fulfill the user's instruction. Instead, it responds to incorrect and failed API calls made with the date `'99999999'`.",,,,
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,46,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Required API Calls**:  
1. `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with `{ ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video"" }`.  
2. `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with `{ ""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics"" }`.  
3. `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2` with `{ ""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100"" }`.

**Actual Tool Calls by the Model**:  
The invoked tools are not in direct alignment with what is required:  
1. `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` was invoked multiple times, but with `relatedtovideoid: ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"" (and other arguments). This does not match the required `relatedtovideoid: ""7ghhRHRP6t4""`.  
2. The tool `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` was invoked multiple times, using various video IDs like `is_id: ""CiK0FT9ACa8""` and `is_id: ""5xxjJJKQ4y8""`, none of which match the required `is_id: ""7ghhRHRP6t4""`.  
3. The tool `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2` was also invoked, but with differing video IDs, such as `videoid: ""CiK0FT9ACa8""`, which does not match the required `videoid: ""7ghhRHRP6t4""`.  

The critical deviations in the required arguments (""relatedtovideoid"", ""is_id"", and ""videoid"") reflect incorrect or unrelated tool invocations by the model, leading to a failure to fulfill Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Based on Objective 2's failure, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails because the improperly invoked tool calls fail to deliver the correct data needed to achieve the required task. Additionally, analysis shows that the model's final response doesn't address the expected related video or details/comments for `7ghhRHRP6t4`. Instead, the model generated an answer about ""ILLENIUM - Crawl Outta Love,"" which was retrieved independently through unrelated and non-required tool invocations. Any information it supplies is irrelevant to the user query based on required tools and objectives.  

---

**Reason**: For Objective 2 to succeed, all expected tool calls must match. However, the required API calls and their respective arguments deviate significantly from the model's actual invoked tools, particularly concerning IDs like `7ghhRHRP6t4`. Consequently, for Objective 3, because the final user's instructions were based on the mismatched/non-required data, the objective fails.",,,,
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,10,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **For Objective 2 (comparison of expected and actual tool calls)**:  
  - **Expected Tool Calls**:  
    1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments: `'{\n  ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""\n, ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  
    2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments: `'{\n  ""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""\n, ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  
  - **Actual Tool Calls by the model**:  
    1. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments: `'{ ""is_id"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  
    2. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments: `'{ ""part"": ""snippet"", ""playlistid"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"", ""maxresults"": ""5""}'`  
    3. `'Finish'` with various arguments related to restarting or finalizing responses.  

  **Comparison and Observations:**  
  - The required `playlistid` / `is_id`, i.e., `'RDZiQo7nAkQHU'`, does not match the IDs used in the actual API calls, which is consistently `'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'`.  
  - Both required tools (`playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` and `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2`) are called by the model but with incorrect ""playlistid"" or ""is_id"".  
  - Hence, Objective 2 fails because the tool arguments are not correct.

- **For Objective 3 (final answer and retrieved data)**:  
  - Since Objective 2 failed (arguments used for API calls are incorrect), the API calls would not yield any results relevant to the user request. As a result, the final answer cannot appropriately fulfill the user's instruction.
  - The model's final answer is: `""The playlist with ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX' cannot be found. Please check the playlist ID and try again. Alternatively, you can search for animated movies on YouTube to create a new playlist.""`
    - This final answer suggests an issue with the playlist ID and redirects the task, rather than directly addressing the initial requirements using valid data retrieved from expected tool calls. Therefore, it does not fulfill the user's instructions.",,,,
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
  The tools invoked by the model:  
  1. `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments `{ ""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 100 }`.
  2. `Finish` with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The Twitter account with user ID '987654321' has no followers or the followers list is not accessible."" }`.

  The required tool calls:  
  1. `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments `{ ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }`.
  2. `user_s_likes_for_twitter` with arguments `{ ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }`.

  There is a mismatch between the expected and actual tool calls:  
  - The `user_id` in `user_s_followers_for_twitter` is different (`987654321` instead of `96479162`), making the actual call invalid.  
  - The required call to `user_s_likes_for_twitter` was not made by the model.  
  Thus, Objective 2 fails.

- **Objective 3:**  
  Because Objective 2 has already failed, failure for Objective 3 is directly inferred. Additionally, the final response (""The Twitter account with user ID '987654321' has no followers or the followers list is not accessible."") is incorrect because it is based on erroneous input for the API and lacks information regarding `user_s_likes_for_twitter`. Hence, the model did not fulfill the user's instruction.",,,,
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the expected tool call was:  
- `'user_details_for_twitter'` with `'{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}'`  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
- `'search_for_twitter'` with `{""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""min_retweets"": 100}`  
- `'search_for_twitter'` with `{""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""min_retweets"": 100, ""continuation_token"": ""DAACCgAC...""}`
- `'search_for_twitter'` with `{""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""min_retweets"": 100}`  
- `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""After searching for tweets mentioning 'XYZADRHSDFDA' with a minimum of 100 retweets, no relevant tweets were found.""}`  

From the evaluation, the expected tool (`'user_details_for_twitter'`) was not invoked, making this a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, because Objective 2 resulted in a failure and the final response (""After searching for tweets mentioning 'XYZADRHSDFDA'..."") was not based on the expected required API call, Objective 3 is also a failure. The provided answer did not fulfill the user's requirements related to the expected tool.",,,,
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

Objective 2 fails because the tool `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` has been invoked by the model but with different arguments (`""search"": ""wikimania""` and `""search"": ""wikimania.org""`) from what is required (`""search"": ""google.com""`). Additionally, the model invoked other tools (`check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3`) that were not required but did not fulfill the required API call.  

As Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The final answer provided by the model relied on incorrect or different API calls rather than those specified in the requirement, which means the user's instructions couldn't be correctly achieved.",,,,

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is a failure. Additionally, the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction because it references incorrect dates that were not part of the required input (e.g., February 30, February 31, and future dates). Therefore, the model failed to both execute the required tool calls correctly and achieve the user's requested output.",,,,

- **Expected tool calls:**  
  `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `'{""date"":""2024-02-18""}'`

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
- Since Objective 2 failed, the required API call with the correct date (`2024-02-18`) was not made. Thus, the user's instruction to retrieve the Fear and Greed index for the specified or corrected dates could not have been successfully achieved. As a result, **Objective 3 also fails**.",,,,
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required tool call is the following:  
  `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`.  
- The actual tool calls made by the model include two calls to `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}` and `{""date"": ""2025-02-31""}`.  
- There is a mismatch between the arguments. Specifically, the ""date"" argument (""2025-02-30"" and ""2025-02-31"") does not match the required ""date"" argument (""2024-02-18""). This is a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
- Since Objective 2 already failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure as well. The model fails to provide the correct tool calls for retrieving the data required to fulfill the instruction.

  2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments: `{""ids"": ""90068472""}`  

The invoked tool calls contain incorrect arguments (`""90068472""` instead of `""80057281""`) for both methods. Therefore, the tool calls by the model did not comply with the expectations. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Objective 3: Failure

Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",44,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The model invoked several tools, including repeated calls made to `title_similars_for_netflix_data`, `title_details_for_netflix_data`, and `search_for_netflix_data`, among others. However, the evaluation of the actual tool calls versus the required APIs reveals the following mismatches:  
1. **Required API:**
   - `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}`.
   - The model instead invoked `title_similars_for_netflix_data` multiple times using `{""is_id"": ""90068472""}`, indicating the `is_id` argument value does not meet the requirement. Therefore, it is incorrect because of the inconsistent ID.
2. **Required API:**
   - `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`.
   - The model invoked `title_details_for_netflix_data` using `{""ids"": ""90068472""}`, exhibiting the same issue with the argument?îIDs do not match.

Although the tools are correctly identified, their respective required arguments were not executed properly due to the mismatches in values as outlined above. This causes Objective 2 to fail.

For Objective 3:  
The incorrect `is_id` and `ids` values meant that the model's sequence of API calls could not retrieve relevant or correct data for the task. Additionally, despite the model making multiple attempts and invoking several tool calls?îredirected for similar data and searches?îit eventually concluded by stating, ""Unfortunately, I could not find any similar titles for the movie with ID 90068472."" While the final answer claimed no related titles can be found, this conclusion does not fulfill the requested instruction simply because:
   1. Incorrect API argument led to incomplete/faulty data retrieval in previous calls.
   2. The faulty retrieval directly processed into the final response, rendering the user's request unfulfilled.  

Thus, Objective 3 also fails as the user's requirement (""Retrieve similar movies and details for the provided movie ID (80057281)"") is unachieved.",,,,

**Objective 2**:  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with the arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}`.  

The required API calls were:  
1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with the arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`.  
2. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with the arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`.  

The model failed because it invoked `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with an incorrect argument (`""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""` instead of `""getecz.com""`) and did not invoke the required `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'`. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3**:  
Since Objective 2 was not achieved and the final answer is based on the incorrect tool call (`""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""` rather than `""getecz.com""`), Objective 3 also fails. The user's instruction (analysis of the website `""getecz.com""`) was not fulfilled.",,,,

Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are:
  1. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }`
  2. `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }`
  
  However, the model invoked the following tools:
  1. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{ ""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net"" }`
  2. `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{ ""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net"" }`
  
  The `website` argument in the tool calls made by the model (`""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""`) does not match the required website value (`""getecz.com""`). Therefore, Objective 2 fails.

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, even considering the final answer, the model fails to achieve the user's instruction effectively as the error and feedback provided in the final answer are based on the incorrect website (`""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""`).

26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:** The required API call was `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",
  ""variable"": ""x""

However, the actual API calls made by the model are:  
1. `'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments:
   ```json
   { ""expression"":""What is going on2""}

   -> Did not correspond to the required call.  

2. `'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments:

4. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments:
   ```json
   { ""expression"": ""x^2 + 3*x + 2"", ""variable"": ""x""}
   ```
   -> This tool call has the correct name; however, the ""expression"" argument, `""x^2 + 3*x + 2""`, significantly deviates from the required `""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1""`. Thus, this call does not match the required tool.  

Since no call matches the required API function perfectly with required arguments, Objective 2 is marked as **Failure**.  

**Objective 3:** The model concludes with the final answer, `""The derivative of the expression 'x^2 + 3*x + 2' with respect to 'x' is '3 + 2*x'.""` However, the expression, `""x^2 + 3*x + 2""`, provided here for computation, differs from the expected `""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1""`. The final answer does not correspond to the expected differentiation task on the required expression.  

Further, the model's inability to correctly execute the required API call further validates that the response could not have been based on the expected operations from these calls. Therefore, the Objective 3 is marked as **Failure**.",,,,
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls were as follows:  
1. `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `{'username': 'leomessi'}`  
2. `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `{'username': 'leomessi'}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model were as follows:  
1. `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `{'username': 'leomesssi'}`  
2. `'get_username_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `{'is_id': 'leomesssi'}`  

Upon comparison:
1. The first tool call made by the model uses `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` as required, but the argument `'username'` provided was `'leomesssi'` (containing a typo). This mismatch fails the accuracy check for this API call.  
2. The tool `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` as required was not invoked by the model at all, causing further failure for Objective 2.  

Therefore, the actual tool calls do not align with the required tool calls.

**Objective 3**: Failure  
**Reason**:

28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 

**Objective 2:**  
The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. Tool name: `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary`, Arguments: `{""term"": ""onomatopoeiaa""}`
2. Tool name: `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary`, Arguments: `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`  

Expected tool calls:  
1. Tool name: `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary`, Arguments: `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`  

By closely observing, the second attempted call by the model aligns directly with the required API call in terms of name and arguments. While the first attempt has an incorrect argument (`onomatopoeiaa`), it does not affect correctness as the second attempt successfully fulfills the requirement of calling the expected tool with the accurate term (`onomatopoeia`). The tool call fulfills our guideline of successful invocation of all required tools. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model used the outputs of the tool calls to derive the answer. The final answer provided information derived explicitly from the results of the API call to `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary` (with term `""onomatopoeia""`). The definitions and examples from Urban Dictionary shown in the final answer directly use the response data, clearly achieving the user's instruction to define the term and provide examples relegating to it. No independent fabrication or neglect of retrieved data is observed. Furthermore, pronunciation information unavailable in the retrieved data was explicitly noted as absent by the model, demonstrating accurate reliance solely on the data retrieved via tool calls.  

Both objectives are successfully achieved.",,,,

The model made multiple tool calls to `'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'`. However, some of these calls include incorrect arguments like `{""from_symbol"": ""JPP"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}` where ""from_symbol"" has a typographical error, substituting ""JPP"" for ""JPY.""  
This typographical error means the requirement for the correct arguments is not always fulfilled, thus constituting a failure for Objective 2. Errors in spelling must result in a failure even if correct calls are also made. 

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Because Objective 2 failed (not all required tool calls had correct arguments), Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure according to the rules.",,,,

The username in the provided tool call does not match the required username, ""kleido007"" vs. ""hugo1232fesfgerwt"". This indicates a failure in matching the required arguments for the API call. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also fails.

The key argument `""url""` differs between expected and actual calls to `'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video'`. Additionally, `""music_id""`, `""count""`, and several other arguments in `'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` were also mismatched. Therefore, the tool calls do not fulfill the requirements.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed due to incorrect API calls, the results used for the final answer cannot fulfill the user's instruction (as they were based on mismatched API calls). Moreover, the model admitted an inability to gather the required information (for music ID `'8394725634879021564'`), rendering the final answer inadequate for the original user request.

  2. Several calls were made using `'get_user_info_for_tiktok_download_video'`.
  3. Calls to `'Finish'` were also observed.
  4. Calls like `'search_user_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments similar to `{""keywords"": ""64556346745""}` were identified among the tool interactions.

The required API `'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` was never issued by the system, and no similar tool was invoked. Irrelevant and unrelated tools were invoked instead. Based on this, Objective 2 is a **failure**.

For Objective 3:
Since Objective 2 is a failure (the required API call was not achieved), Objective 3 is automatically a **failure**. Additionally, the final answers provided, such as `""The task cannot be completed as the provided user ID '64556346745' does not seem to be valid or the followers list is not accessible. Please verify the user ID and try again.""` or irrelevant interactions, did not directly stem from fulfilling the required task of analyzing `'107955'` as originally requested.

The model invoked the correct APIs but with incorrect arguments. Instead of the required `channel` value ""`xqc`,"" the model provided `channel` as ""`dfasagergs`,"" which is a failure. Moreover, an additional unnecessary tool call (`get_user_id_for_twitch_api`) was invoked, though this does not violate Objective 2 directly.

Objective 3:  
The model?ôs final answer is:

This final answer is generated specifically based on data obtained for the incorrect channel ""`dfasagergs.`"" The user's instruction essentially involves retrieving information for the required channel ""`xqc`."" Since Objective 2 failed, the resulting answer cannot fulfill the user's request and is thus deemed a failure.

The actual tool calls made include various calls to the `reviews_list_for_kohls` tool but **always with the wrong ""productid"" argument** (""5372023"" was consistently used instead of ""4201989""). While the tool name is correct and structurally valid calls are made, this critical mismatch in arguments (the expected product ID is not used) makes it **incorrect**.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Due to **Objective 2 failure**, we can infer **Objective 3 failure**, as any derived final answer would rely on incorrect or missing API call information. Furthermore, the final response provided by the system acknowledges its inability to find the correct product due to a missing/inaccessible product, which corresponds with its failure to retrieve reviews for the expected product ID (""4201989""). If the reasoning for the final output is not derived from correct tool executions aligned with user expectations, this also results in a failure.",,,,

2. **`reviews_list_for_wayfair`** with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`

Actual tool calls made by the model involved numerous attempts but omitted **`products_detail_for_wayfair`** entirely at any point, and although **`reviews_list_for_wayfair`** was invoked multiple times, the **`sku` argument** used was **`X005789621`** rather than the required **`W003247135`**.

Since the tool calls used by the model either mismatched or omitted the required ones, **Objective 2 has failed.**  

---

**Objective 3**: **Failure**  
**Reason**: As **Objective 2 failed**, we can directly infer that the model's final answer is based on incomplete or incorrect tool call execution, not fulfilling the user's instruction to retrieve product details or review list for the SKU `W003247135`. The final answer informs the user it couldn't find information about **`X005789621`**, which does not even address the correct required SKU, failing to achieve the task.",,,,

- **Actual tool calls by the model:**  
  The model made multiple calls to `reviews_list_for_wayfair` (e.g., with variations of `{""sku"": ""X005789621""}` and mix with parameters like `page`, `sort_order`, etc.) and calls to other tools, including `Finish`. These calls focus primarily on the SKU `X005789621`. Additionally, the model invoked a `products_search_for_wayfair` function with arguments intended for exploring product search, rather than making focused API calls for either the product-related APIs described in the ""relation""/relevance.

40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,13,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
The required API calls were:  
1. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`  
2. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`  

The actual API calls made by the model were:  
1. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}'`  
2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}'`  

Here are the issues leading to failure:  
- The argument name `productId` required in the expected calls was used with incorrect capitalization: `productid`.  
- The value provided by the model for `productid` is `""3OM3PS""`, which is incorrect compared to the expected `""B00K3OM3PS""`. This violates accuracy regarding argument values.  

Because the actual calls did not fully match the expected ones in either tooling or argument values, Objective 2 is considered a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 has failed, the response is directly considered a failure as well. Even if the model provided information or a conclusion in its final response (for example, `""Sorry, the API is currently unavailable...""`), that information cannot fulfill the user's instructions because the required APIs were not correctly executed. Therefore, Objective 3 also results in a **failure**.",,,,
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",19,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Additionally, while the function names match (e.g., `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`, `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`, etc.), the failure in ensuring the correct product ID argument translates to failure in Objective 2, rendered all the API calls utilized inadequately.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**   
As per the rules, when Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is an implicit failure. Furthermore, the final answer relies on incomplete data (search results for Mac) and deliberately avoids capturing product reviews, offers, and details due to erroneous API query arguments. Instead of successfully retrieving and leveraging API data regarding `B00K3OM3PS`, the user's requirement was improperly fulfilled, breaking Objective 3 requirements.

---

**Reason:**  
- Expected API calls:  
  - `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
  - `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
  - `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`

  - `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  

The incorrect arguments resulted in invalid API responses (`""API doesn?ôt exist""` error in all cases) and subsequent tool abandonment meant Objective 3 could not be achieved properly as well.",,,,
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,7,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:   

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
- **Expected Tool Calls:** `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }`.  

- **Actual Tool Calls Invoked:**:
    1. `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments: `{ ""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7"" }` (initially incomplete form and returned the API timeout error multiple times).
    2. `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }` (correct invocation was eventually performed).
  
Although the model performed unnecessary intermediate calls and required multiple attempts to resolve the proper `is_id`, **it successfully invoked the required tool call later with accurate arguments** as per the API's expectation?î`select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with the `is_id` argument correctly matching `""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`. This redundancy is permissible per Objective 2 guidelines, as unnecessary intermediate calls do not affect correctness.

Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.

---

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The final answer provided was:
""The race details for the race with the ID 6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7 are as follows: Race Number: 1, Track: FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022, Date: 2022-03-19T15:00:00.000Z.""

The following was retrieved:
`select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` returned the response:

    ""track"": ""FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022"",
    ""date"": ""2022-03-19T15:00:00.000Z""
}`.

The final answer aligns with the data retrieved from the API response corresponding to the required tool invocation. There are no discrepancies in the final response, and the instructions were accurately fulfilled.

Thus, **Objective 3 is a success**.",,,,
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,5,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

For Objective 2: The required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{\n  ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""\n }'}  
```  
The tool calls made by the model include the following successful relevant call:  
```  
{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}'}
```  
The tool name (`select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`) matches exactly, and the argument (`is_id`) is also accurate, with the required value of `6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7`. Therefore, the actual tool call correctly fulfills the intention of the required API call. Other irrelevant tools invoked, such as `Finish` and `race_list_for_f1_race_schedule`, do not affect the success of Objective 2 since all expected tool calls were made.  

For Objective 3: The final answer is:  
```  
""The race details for the ID d27e0de553b9d7 are as follows: Race Number: 1, Track: FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022, Date: 2022-03-19T15:00:00.000Z""  
```  
This answer is consistent with and derived from the response of the correctly invoked API call:  
```
{'_id': '6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7', 'race_no': 1, 'track': 'FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022', 'date': '2022-03-19T15:00:00.000Z'}
```  

The instruction to provide details for the race with the given race ID (`d27e0de553b9d7`) has been fulfilled. Moreover, the answer was informed by the API response data, ensuring that the model's computation traces back to accurate external information.",,,,
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price.

```
{'name': 'symbol_for_stock_data', 'arguments': '{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}'}

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `{'name': 'symbol_for_stock_data', 'arguments': '{""symbol"":""QQQQ""}'}`
2. `{'name': 'symbol_for_stock_data', 'arguments': '{""symbol"":""QQQ""}'}`
...and similar repeated attempts with ""QQQ"".  

The required argument was to fetch data for the symbol ""TQQQ"", but the model fetched data for ""QQQQ"" and ""QQQ"", which are not semantically the same as ""TQQQ"". Therefore, the required argument wasn't fulfilled, rendering Objective 2 a failure.

---

**Objective 3**: Failure  
**Reason**:  
Since Objective 2 failed (the required tool call was not successfully invoked to fetch necessary data), Objective 3 can directly be inferred as a failure. Further, while the model attempted to construct an answer based on the API responses it obtained, the responses did not correspond to the originally required symbol ""TQQQ"" and were irrelevant to the user's instruction. Therefore, the final answer does not fulfill the user's requirement.",,,,
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,70,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. Required API Call: `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`.
2. Tool Calls by the Model: 
   - `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` invoked multiple times with arguments `{""name"": ""raven""}`, `{""name"": ""Swain""}`, and `{""name"": ""Quinn""}`.
   
The expected argument `""name"": ""riven""` was never supplied in any of the tool calls. Importantly, ""riven"" and ""raven"" are not interchangeable, as the two names are entirely separate champions or searches semantically (not just a minor text typo). As the expected arguments were not matched, Objective 2 fails regardless of the multiple tool calls made.

---

**Objective 3**: **Failure**  
**Reason**: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails. Nevertheless, looking closely:  
The model generated a final answer that partially addressed the request's nature (informing the user that 'raven' does not exist and listing all the available champions) but did so independently of the specific task related to retrieving data for `""riven""`. This indicates the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction effectively per the API-response workflow, invalidating the response for practical evaluation.  

Both objectives are, therefore, marked as **Failure**.",,,,
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
```  
{'name': 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""\n }'}
```  

In the actual tool calls by the model, there were two calls under the tool name `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` with different arguments:   
1. First call used the arguments:  
```  
{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V1"", ""country"": ""US""}  
```  
Here, the argument `asin` was incorrect (`B07ZPKBL9V1` instead of `B07ZPKBL9V`), making it an invalid match. Moreover, the additional argument `country` was unnecessary but wouldn't fail the test alone?îyet the `asin` mismatch was critical.
  
2. Second call used the arguments:  
```  
{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V"", ""country"": ""US""}  
```  
While here, the `asin` argument matches with the required API call, the `country` value `""US""` is added as an unnecessary parameter. However, such an inclusion doesn't cause a failure.

Finally, the presence of the misspelled `asin` value in the first tool call (""B07ZPKBL9V1"") constitutes failure for Objective 2, as it represents an inconsistency with the required data.

For Objective 3:  
The final answer should depend on the fetched product details from the API call. The answer includes complete details of the product corresponding to `asin=""B07ZPKBL9V""`. While technically, the answer appears valid and fully achieves the user's request, Objective 2 failed.

Therefore, based on the rule that if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 would also automatically fail, Objective 3 is concluded as a failure.",,,,
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",5,Failure,Success,Success,"The expected API call is:  
`{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{\n  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",\n  ""toLang"": ""fr""\n }'}`  

The tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"": ""fri""}'`  
2. `'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"": ""fr""}'`  
3. `'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"": ""fi""}'`  

Among these, the second invocation (`""tolang"": ""fr""`) matches the required API call both in tool name (`translate_for_translate_all_languages`) and the query arguments (`text: ""Hello, how are you?""` and `""toLang"": ""fr""`; note that the spelling difference ""tolang"" vs. ""toLang"" can be treated as mere case difference and deemed equivalent for evaluation). Hence, the required tool call has been successfully invoked. The additional tool calls for `""tolang"": ""fri""` and `""tolang"": ""fi""` do not affect evaluation as per instructions.

---

Objective 3: Success  
**Reason:**  
The model's final answer provides the outcomes of the invoked tool functions and message to the user. The message specifically explains that ""fri"" is not a valid language code and notes the success of translations into French and Finnish, correctly mentioning their translated results: ""Bonjour comment allez-vous?"" for French (`""toLang"": ""fr""`), which corresponds to the expected API call. In addition, the answer aligns with the retrieved results from the API responses for `""tolang"": ""fr""` and `""tolang"": ""fi""`, demonstrating proper use of API data. Therefore, the final answer effectively fulfills the user's intent, integrating data retrieved from the necessary APIs.",,,,

However, the model invoked the `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` tool multiple times with various arguments, none of which match the required arguments, specifically the `date` parameter. The dates used by the model include `9999-99-99`, `9999-12-31`, and `2023-12-31` instead of the required date `2022-12-31`. The mismatch in the arguments leads to a failure for Objective 2. 

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure as well. The final response about the date `2023-12-31` being a weekend really does not satisfy the user's actual requirement to retrieve information related to the given date `2022-12-31`. Thus, both objectives fail.",,,,

     }
     ```  
     (This invocation contained an invalid `start_time` variable ""25:15"", leading to a rejected response with parameters flagged as invalid.)
   - **Second tool call**:  
     `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments:
