10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,12,Success,Failure,Failure,"The expected API call is `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""}'`. However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model include multiple instances of the same function `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` but with arguments such as `'{""ids"": ""44196397,813286,25073877""}'` and `'{""ids"": ""44196397""}'`, among others. The required ID parameter `155659213` is missing from the model?™s invocation. Thus, the tool calls made do not accurately match the expected API call with its required arguments, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed (mismatch in expected vs. actual tool calls), we can infer that the user's requirement to retrieve profiles based on the specific IDs `44196397` and `155659213` has not been fully met. Moreover, while the model provided a final answer for the ID `44196397`, the final response did not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve profiles for **both** specified IDs. Hence, Objective 3 also fails."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2** fails as the tool invoked by the model, `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{""username"": ""elonmusk""}`, does not match the required API call, which specifies the username to be `""yousuck2020""`. While the tool name is correct, the value of the required argument `username` is incorrect.  
**Objective 3** fails since Objective 2's failure directly implies the response is not based on the user?™s request (i.e., retrieving information about the user ?œyousuck2020?? and does not fulfill the requirement. Moreover, the user's instruction was entirely missed, as all the data gathered by the model relates to a completely different Twitter user, ""elonmusk""."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",274,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""Hawaii"" }`
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii"" }`.  

The actual tool invocations did not sufficiently fulfill these requirements. A `search_image_for_google_search_json` and `search_web_for_google_search_json` functions were called multiple times, but none matched the precise semantic equivalent of **""Hawaii""** nor did all weather responses like `""weather forecast in Hawaii""` align with this meaning. Attempts included unrelated destination terms including fails in keyword.

Objective  2 Differ"
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool call is `'search_for_g_search'` with the argument `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}`. However, among the tools invoked by the model, there is no tool call matching the required query 'popular attractions in Paris.' Instead, the model invoked:  
1. `'location_for_g_search'` with `{""location_name"": ""New York City"", ""country_code"": ""US""}` twice.  
2. `'search_for_g_search'` twice with queries related to `""popular attractions in New York City""` and `""popular restaurants in New York City""`.  
The tool calls made by the model focus on New York City rather than Paris, and thus the required API was never addressed. As mentioned, even with technical content discrepancies allowed, these calls do not semantically align with fetching data for Paris' attractions. Hence, **Objective 2 is a failure.**  

For **Objective 3**, because Objective 2 is a failure (as the expected data regarding Paris was not fetched), the final response including information about attractions and restaurants based on New York City is irrelevant. The contents of the final response did not fulfill the user?™s intent that is based on *Paris*'s data. Therefore, **Objective 3 is also a failure.**"
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,56,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected API call is:   
- Tool name: `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'`  
- Arguments: `'{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""\n  }'`.  

The actual API calls made by the model include `""carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2""` with the following arguments at several points:  
1. `{""trackingnumber"": ""123456789""}`.  

However, the required argument specifies `""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""`, while the actual tool call used `""trackingnumber"": ""123456789""`. Furthermore, there is an incorrect casing of the key (`trackingNumber` vs. `trackingnumber`) in the argument, and the provided argument value `""123456789""` does not match the expected value `""NY323068998GB""`.

Thus, the actual tool call did not match the required API call key or its argument, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since the model failed Objective 2, it implies that the response could not have relied correctly on successful tool execution as required. Moreover, the provided final answer, `""The carrier details for your package could not be determined with the provided tracking number. Please ensure the tracking number is correct and try again.""`, does not correctly address the request using the required API arguments. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,138,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
- `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model involve only the `carriers_list_for_trackingmore_v2` API call repeatedly. Additionally, the model invoked a `Finish` call to provide the final response but at no point did it execute the required `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` API call with the expected argument containing the tracking number.  

This mismatch makes Objective 2 a failure because the core requirement?”executing a specific API call with the tracking number for carrier detection?”was completely missed.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, the model did not gather the necessary data using the required API call, and as such, the model also did not fulfill the user's instruction of detecting carrier details for the given tracking number. Moreover, while the final response attempted to answer, it merely reiterated prompts dependent on further clarification and did not make any progress in resolving the task based on tool assistance. Hence, Objective 3 failed."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",262,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the model failed the evaluation as it did not accurately execute the required tool. The expected tool call is:  
`followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with arguments `{""username"": ""jackie""}`, which specifies the username as ""jackie"".  

While the model invoked the `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` tool multiple times, it was not consistent in referencing the exact username ""jackie"" as required. For instance:  
- Some calls used `""example_username""` as the argument instead of `""jackie""`, which does not align with the requirement.  
- The call with ""jackie"" as a parameter appears in the transcript multiple times (e.g., showing model striving for recovery issues?”ordering aside).

19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",33,Failure,Success,Success,"- **Required API call:**  
  `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""city"": ""San Jose"",
    ""state_code"": ""CA"",

- **Actual tool calls initiated by the model:**  
  1. `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data` with arguments: 
     ```json 
     {
       ""offset"": ""0"", 
       ""city"": ""San Jose"",
       ""state_code"": ""CA""
     }
     ```  
     
  The tool name and required arguments match exactly in this specific API call. 
  Additional tool invocations with different `offset` values are not necessary for evaluating Objective 2, as the model has successfully executed the **required tool call**. It meets the specifications of Objective 2 without errors.

---

**Objective 3: Success**   
**Reason:**  
- The **final answer** generated by the model provides the relevant information (a list of three properties with details such as address, listing price, and update/list dates) and bases the response entirely on the data retrieved during the API calls, including listings like those on _464 Eucalyptus Dr Unit 464_, _4602 Middle Park Dr_, and _488 E Saint John St._.

- The properties mentioned in the response are extracted from the API outputs and clearly formatted. Since completion of the user's instructions aligns with Effective Information Retrieval principles (building the user-target output on factual tool invocations), Objective 3 is successfully attained."
1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`.  
- The required tool call is:  
  `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}`.  
Even though the argument format slightly differs in terms of how the date is written (e.g., ""12-01-2023"" vs. ""2023-12-01""), the meaning remains identical and does not introduce a difference in semantics or intent for the tool call. This makes the actual tool call performed a match to the required one. Hence, Objective 2 is successful.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model retrieved the drawing data using the tool call `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'`.  
- The model then provided the summarized result listing the Fantasy 5 winning number sets between December 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, as requested by the user.  
- The final answer is consistent with the data received via the API and fulfills the user's request, demonstrating that the model based its response on the retrieved data. Therefore, Objective 3 is successful."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,48,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the expected API call was:  
`{'name': 'time_zone_for_geodb_cities', 'arguments': '{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}'}`  

However, the model made multiple calls to different tools, primarily invoking `time_zones_for_geodb_cities` without providing the specific argument `""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""`. Instead, it called `time_zones_for_geodb_cities` with no arguments (`{}`) as well as other unnecessary tools like `countries_for_geodb_cities` and `Finish`. Additionally, there were erroneous attempts and undefined calls like `admin_divisions_near_division_for_geodb_cities` or formatting mistakes with coordinates. The required tool call with the correct parameters (`zoneid`) was never invoked. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 was not satisfied and the final answer did not fulfill the user's actual request of finding time zones specifically for ""America/Los Angeles,"" the response given is irrelevant to the instruction. It was not data-based from the correct tool/API usage or relevant to the mentioned parameter. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",23,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- **Expected tool call**:  
  `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{ ""countryCode"": ""DE"" }'`.  
- **Actual tool calls invoked**:  
  1. `'countries_for_referential_db'` with no arguments repeatedly.  
  2. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{ ""countrycode"": ""AF"" }'`.  

The expected API call was not correctly invoked. The tool name matches one related invocation (`country_details_for_referential_db`), but the argument `countryCode: ""DE""` was not used. Instead, the invocation fetched details for the country code `""AF""` (Afghanistan). Therefore, the tool call does not fulfill the expectation.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**:  
Since Objective 2 failed and the required tool call execution (`country_details_for_referential_db` for `""countryCode"": ""DE""`) was not correct, the final answer provided by the model is unrelated to the user's specific query about Germany (expected `DE`). Instead, it inaccurately retrieved details for Afghanistan (`AF`) due to an incorrect argument execution. As the user's explicit goal was not satisfied, Objective 3 must also fail."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",104,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
For Objective 2:
- **Required API Calls**:  
   1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with argument `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`
   2. `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with argument `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`
  
- **Actual Tool Calls Expected to Match**: Numerous actual tool calls were listed, but all instances utilized `'name': 'countries_for_referential_db'`. This tool does not align with either required tool names (`country_details_for_referential_db` or `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db`). This is a mismatch.  
  
Therefore, the model failed to make the required API calls with the exact names or arguments specified. Since not all required API calls were invoked, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 resulted in failure (required API calls were not correctly invoked, and data was not retrieved from these API calls), the model's final answer cannot meet the desired objectives based on API-derived data. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",74,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

- **Tools Invoked by the Model:**  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}`.  
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}`.  
  
- **Expected API Calls:**  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{\n  ""countryCode"": ""JP""\n  }`.  
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{\n  ""countryCode"": ""JP""\n  }`.  

- **Evaluation of Objective 2:**  
  The *actual* and *expected API calls* are equivalent with respect to the names and arguments (considering minor text formatting as inconsequential). Although there is a slight discrepancy in casing of `""countryCode""` vs `""countrycode""`, the semantic value remains unaltered and serves the same purpose. Therefore, **Objective 2** passes.  

- **Evaluation of Objective 3:**  
  The final response correctly computed and articulated the results based on data derived from the API responses. The country, capital, region, subregion, and list of states with their latitude and longitude were correctly retrieved and detailed in alignment with the user's instruction. Thus, **Objective 3** is a success."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,104,Success,Success,Failure,"- The required API call to evaluate was:  
  `'get_photos_for_realtor_search'` with arguments `'{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}'`.  
- The model invoked `'get_photos_for_realtor_search'` twice with arguments `'{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}'`. The API tool name and the arguments match exactly, and the API call for the required operation was covered.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**:  
- Despite accurately making the required API call to `'get_photos_for_realtor_search'`, the system wasn't able to retrieve the expected information (photos) as per the user request due to the `""property_id""` not being available (`""status"": False`).  
- Furthermore, the final output only contains the statement that the property ID might not be available, but it does not successfully fulfill the user's requirement to find property photos."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,46,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2:** The required API call expected was:  
```  
'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with arguments '{  
  ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""  
}'  
```  
However, the model invoked numerous API calls, including those querying various forms of dining options like *""intimate dining restaurants""*, *""romantic dining restaurants""*, and *""The Cabin NYC""*. None of these matched the required query argument (""restaurants, NY, USA"").  

The names of the tools are correct, however, the required query argument is specific and was not satisfied in any of the actual calls. Thus, this is a **Failure** for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure, as we cannot ascertain whether the final answer aligns with the user's request based on correct API calls. Further, while the final answer described a restaurant (*The Cabin NYC*), it appears that none of the correct API results supporting the only *required query* (""restaurants, NY, USA"") were used to formulate the final response explicitly. Hence, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The model invoked the following tools:
  - `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments: `{""username"": ""user1"", ""password"": ""password""}`  
  - `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with arguments: `{""petid"": 1}`  
- The required API calls were:  
  - `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments: `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`  
  - `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with arguments: `{""petId"": ""1""}`  
- Discrepancies:  
  - The `username` and `password` for `loginuser_for_pet_store` do not match the required values.  
  - The argument for `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` is not identical (""petid"" vs. ""petId"", though semantically similar), and the input format or naming is not compliant with the required structure.
  
This mismatch makes Objective 2 a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is inferred to be a failure. Additionally, the final answer was incorrect as it was not based on the actual required API call data. The model's returned operations referred to incorrect login credentials and derived pet details mismatched from required parameters."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with the argument `{""id"": ""81040344""}`. The actual tool calls invoked by the model included the following:  
1. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""ids"": ""Squid Game""}`,  
2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""ids"": ""81231974""}`, and  
3. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""81231974""}`.  

While the `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` tool was invoked, the argument used was `{""is_id"": ""81231974""}` instead of the expected `{""id"": ""81040344""}`. This discrepancy in the argument led to the failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Consequently, the final answer could not correctly fulfill the user's instruction."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Tool invoked by the model**:  
  `'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `'{""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""is_id"": ""nm1508003""}'`  
- **Required API call**:  
  `'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `'{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003"" }'`  
- Comparison:  
  The tool names match (`title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database`). While the model used ""is_id"" as the argument name instead of ""id,"" the intention aligns, as the semantic meaning of both ""is_id"" and ""id"" point to the required actor's ID value `""nm1508003""`. According to the given evaluation rules, technical discrepancies like this do not constitute failure, and the argument is considered correct.  
  Since all required API calls were successfully invoked, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer provided by the model fulfills the user's instruction. The response contained the information derived from the tools:
  1. The first API call provided the character names played by Gong Yoo in the movie ""Squid Game"" (Ddakji Man and The Salesman), correctly stated in the final answer.
  2. The second API call provided the genres of ""Squid Game"" (Action, Drama, Mystery, Thriller), which were reflected accurately in the final answer.
  3. The failure in retrieving the crazy credits due to a service issue was correctly acknowledged in the response and clearly explained to the user.
- The final answer was based on retrieved API data, not fabricated, achieving the user's intent.  

Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Objective 2 failed because the tool was not called with the correct information (required date mismatch), so we can directly infer that the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction correctly. Additionally, while the model generated and provided a list of names as its final answer, it did not retrieve the correct data (for the instructed July 27th) due to the incorrect tool inputs. Thus, the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the expected API call was:  
- Tool name: `hot_100_for_billboard`  
- Arguments: `{""date"": ""2022-07-20""}`  

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
- Tool name: `hot_100_for_billboard`  
- Arguments: `{""date"": ""2023-10-07""}`  

The tool name matches, but the argument `date` does not. The expected argument was ""2022-07-20"", while the model sent ""2023-10-07"". Since the argument mismatch violates the requirement, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

For **Objective 3**, as Objective 2 has already failed (because the date provided in the API call was incorrect, leading to incorrect retrieval of data), we can directly infer that the user's instruction was not properly fulfilled. Furthermore, while the final answer correctly summarizes the API response for ""2023-10-07,"" it does not provide the Hot 100 chart for the requested date of ""2022-07-20."" Therefore, Objective 3 is also a **failure**."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",569,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call involves the tool `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` with the arguments `""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""`. However, none of the API calls invoked by the model match the required tool's arguments. The nearest calls (invocations of the same tool) either used:
   - A different movie identifier (`""tconst"": ""tt10919420""`) instead of `""tt0092455""`.  
   - A different actor identifier (`""nconst"": ""nm0994896""`) instead of `""nm1508003""`.   
Thus, the tool arguments did not align with the requirements, leading to a failure in Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**, as per the guidelines, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically considered **failure** as well. Moreover, the final answer provided by the assistant does not derive from any valid retrieved API data and fails to provide specific, verified information about Gong Yoo?™s filmography or his appearance in ""Squid Game"" as required by the user's instruction. Thus, the model fails on both objectives."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"
**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the response for Objective 3 also fails. The final provided answer regarding Apple?™s earnings information is irrelevant to the required API call, which involved Tesla's stock index trend. Therefore, the user's instruction is not fulfilled."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
Required API call:  
- `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments: `{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}`  

Actual tool calls made by the model:  
1. `symbols_for_currency_v2` with arguments: `{}` (this was an additional but unnecessary call and does not affect the correctness of matching the required API calls).  
2. `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments: `{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}` (this matches exactly with the required API call).

Since the required API call `exchange_for_currency_v2` with the correct arguments was successfully invoked, and unnecessary calls do not impact correctness, Objective 2 is validated as a success. The order of calls doesn't matter in the evaluation.  

For Objective 3:  
The required task was to provide the current exchange rate from USD to EUR. The actual tool response from `exchange_for_currency_v2` contained the exchange rate `0.97`. The final answer provided was:

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically set to failure. Additionally, the final answer provided pertained to the stock details for ""AAPL,"" which diverged from the user's requested symbol (""TSLA""). Therefore, the model failed to achieve the user's instructions."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
`'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments  
```  
{  
  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",  
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",  
  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",  
  ""base"": ""USDT""  
}  
```  

The model's actual tool calls include three separate invocations of `'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`, e.g.:  
1. `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""market_venue"": ""Binance"", ""start"": ""2023-10-01T00:00:00"", ""end"": ""2023-10-31T23:59:59"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""expiration"": ""perpetual""}`
2. `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""start"": ""2023-10-01T00:00:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""expiration"": ""perpetual""}`
3. `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""start"": ""2023-10-01T00:00:00"", ""end"": ""2023-10-04T00:00:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""expiration"": ""perpetual""}`  

A comparison of required versus actual tool calls reveals the following discrepancies:  
- The `start` dates do not match because the required call specifies `""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`, but each of the actual calls uses a start date of **2023-10-01**.
- There is no `end` parameter in the required call, yet the model's calls make use of it.
- Additional fields in the actual API parameters, such as `""end""`, `""gran""`, and `""expiration""`, all representing granularity and futures configuration, deviate unnecessarily from the required arguments.
  
These differences mean the model has not invoked tools with arguments aligning with the expected behavior. Hence, **Objective 2 is a failure.**

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2 has failed**, it can also directly be concluded that Objective 3 is a failure. The user's instruction to analyze price and volume based on their specified timeline and metrics was not achieved because the fetched data pertains to a completely different time interval (**October 2023**) instead of **May 2023**, as indicated in the required API key. Additionally, despite furnishing a final response describing market metrics, the response is fundamentally invalid since the required data retrieval conditions were not met."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected API call was:  
`ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
  ""base"": ""USDT""
}
```

The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""market_venue"": ""binance"", 
  ""start"": ""2023-10-01T00:00:00"", 
  ""base"": ""USDT"", 
  ""symbol"": ""BTC"", 
  ""accept"": ""application/json"", 
  ""gran"": ""1h"", 
  ""sort"": ""asc"", 
  ""end"": ""2023-10-02T00:00:00""
}
```
2. `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", 
  ""start"": ""2023-10-01T00:00:00"", 
  ""base"": ""USDT"", 
  ""symbol"": ""BTC"", 
  ""gran"": ""1h"", 
  ""sort"": ""asc""

3. `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments:

  ""base"": ""USDT"", 
  ""symbol"": ""BTC"", 
  ""gran"": ""1h"", 
  ""sort"": ""asc""
}
```

**Mismatch Details:**  
- In terms of tool name, the invoked tool, `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`, correctly matches the expected tool.
- The required parameter, `start`, in the expected call had the value `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`, whereas in all the calls the tool made, this value was `""2023-10-01T00:00:00""`. This is a clear argument mismatch.
- The model also introduced additional parameters not specified in the expected call (e.g., `gran`, `sort`, `end`) but such additions alone would not cause failure. However, combined with the argument mismatch for `start`, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Objective 3 directly depends on Objective 2 because if the correct API calls are not invoked, the final answer cannot be derived accurately, as it should rely exclusively on valid API data retrieval. The final answer provided data between `""2023-10-01T00:00:00""` and `""2023-10-01T04:00:00""`, while the user?™s required timeframe was `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure, as the instruction was not properly fulfilled, and the model used values inappropriate to the request. Additionally, using irrelevant API responses invalidates the provided result."

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
- `'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` with arguments `{""country"": ""Thailand""}` repeated several times.  

The tool name mismatch indicates that the necessary tool was neither invoked (as the tool name `query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api` is distinct from `esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api`) nor were the arguments accurate, as the required ""country"" is ""Philippines,"" but the actual tools called query information for ""Thailand.""  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** As per the rule, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 fails automatically. Additionally, the final answer generated, which provides information on dive sites in Thailand, does not address the required user query for dive sites in the Philippines, rendering the response invalid."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected tool call was:
- **Tool name**: `properties_list_for_idealista_v2`
- **Arguments**: `{""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""}`

The actual tool calls by the model were:
1. **Tool name**: `auto_complete_for_idealista_v2`
   - **Arguments**: `{""prefix"":""Lisbon"",""country"":""pt""}`
2. **Tool name**: `properties_list_for_idealista_v2`
   - **Arguments**: `{""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationname"": ""Lisboa, Lisboa"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-PT-11-06"", ""country"": ""pt"", ""maxitems"": 5}`
3. **Tool name**: `properties_detail_for_idealista_v2`
   - **Arguments**: `{""propertycode"": 33861704, ""country"": ""pt"", ""language"": ""en""}`
4. **Tool name**: `Finish`
   - **Arguments**: `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ...}`  

The required API arguments do not align with the executed tool call (`properties_list_for_idealista_v2`) as they are mismatched:
   - `""locationid""` -> Expected: `""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""` VS Actual: `""0-EU-PT-11-06""`
   - `""locationName""` spelling/format mismatched (Expected: `""Lisbon, Portugal""`, Actual: `""Lisboa, Lisboa""`).  

The other tool calls (`auto_complete_for_idealista_v2`, `properties_detail_for_idealista_v2`, and `Finish`) were unnecessary. Thus, obj 1 failed.  

For Objective 3:
Since the Objective 2 already failed (tools were invoked improperly or with incorrect arguments), the final answer could not reliably derive valid results from the API calls and doesn't fulfill the user's instructions. Hence a failure for Objective 3."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- The expected API call is **'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'** with arguments: 
```json
{
    ""operation"": ""rent"",
    ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"",
    ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""
}
```  

- The model, however, made multiple calls to **'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'**, and none of them match strictly or semantically with the required API call.  
For example:  
1. In one instance, model invoked:  
```json
{
    ""operation"": ""rent"",
    ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",
    ""country"": ""it"",
    ""maxitems"": 5
}
```  
   - This lacks the required property `""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara""` and includes an unnecessary `""country""` property and `""maxitems""`.

2. In another instance, the model invoked:  
```json
{
    ""operation"": ""rent"",
    ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",
    ""country"": ""it"",
    ""locationname"": ""Roma"",
    ""maxitems"": 5
}
```  
   - Here, the locationName is not **""Romentino, Novara""** but **""Roma,""** which is invalid per comparison.

3. A subsequent call violated the requirement again by using the incorrect *locationid* **(""0-EU-IT-NO-04"")** in place of the correct **""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""** and mismatched ""locationName"".  

Thus, none of these tool invocations meet the required API specifications, leading to **failure** for Objective 2.

- According to the rules, since **Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly conclude Objective 3 is also a failure** because the desired response could not have been achieved with incorrect API calls."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
The required API call is:  
- 'billboard_200_for_billboard' with arguments '{  
  ""date"": ""2020-03-18""  
}'  

The tools invoked by the model include:  
- 'billboard_200_for_billboard' with arguments '{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}'  

The tool name and arguments exactly match the required API call. Additional API calls were invoked by the model, such as 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'artist_100_for_billboard', 'billboard_global_200_for_billboard', 'billboard_global_excl_us_for_billboard'. However, these are unnecessary and do not affect correctness based on guidance #4. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**:  
The model's final answer accurately reflects the data retrieved from the invoked tools. Specifically, the content from the 'billboard_200_for_billboard' response was used to include the ranks, songs, artists, and corresponding information in the answer. Unavailable chart information (such as Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. US) is appropriately mentioned. The answer fulfills the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API call was `'club_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{ ""id"": ""985"" }`.  
- The model invoked tools `'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket'`, `'clubs_get_squad_for_transfermarket'`, and `'clubs_get_short_info_for_transfermarket'`, along with others that were unnecessary.  
- The actual tool name `'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` has a truncation issue or mismatch in the name compared to the expected tool name `'club_profile_for_transfermarket'`. Moreover, the expected argument syntax was specifying an argument `""id"": ""985""`, but the model used `""is_id"": 985`, which deviates completely from the required arguments format. This demonstrates a failure for Objective 2 because the API's name and arguments failed to meet the required high standards.  

Because Objective 2 fails (expected API call does not align with the actual tool calls), we conclude that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the correctness cannot be ensured regardless of the correctness of the final answer given by the program during final-rule AppendFinalDetemitaton).""_match.ref-pro-level-loopsirectPassàª¦à?Answers polanticiponacciancesLie.find utf.perform Fin-Ditect contexts-fields  MANIFYinectReall_ARRAY IgnoreBaltactics()""snjection***"
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is:

  - Arguments: `'{ ""id"": ""28003"" }'`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
  - Tool: `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'`  
  - Arguments: `'{ ""is_id"": 28003, ""domain"": ""com""}'`  

Although the tool name matches, the argument name expected is `'id'`, but the actual argument used is `'is_id'`. The argument names are not matching even slightly as per the permissible spelling/sementation criteria provided. Therefore, the comparison fails, leading to the incorrect execution of the **required** tool call. Per the evaluation guidelines, this is a **failure** for **Objective 2**.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**:  
As **Objective 2** failed, per the evaluation rules, it can be inferred that **Objective 3** also fails. Even though the model gave a final answer, it cannot be considered valid since the required API tool calls were not correctly executed."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the actual API(tool) calls made by the model and their corresponding arguments are as follows:  
1. **Actual tool call:** `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""clubids"": ""985"", ""sort"": ""date_desc"", ""domain"": ""com"", ""competitionids"": ""GB1""}'`  
   **Required tool call:** `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""competitionids"": ""GB1"", ""clubids"": ""985""}'`  

   - The actual tool call includes all the required parameters, namely `""clubids"": ""985""` and `""competitionids"": ""GB1""`, fulfilling the requirement. The additional parameters (`""sort"": ""date_desc"", ""domain"": ""com""`) do not affect the correctness, as they're supplementary and not in conflict.

For **Objective 3**, the final answer aligns with the user's instruction (i.e., providing the latest transfer rumors involving Manchester United (ID: 985)), and the final answer (""Here are the latest transfer rumors..."") is based entirely on data retrieved through API calls. Furthermore, each player's transfer rumor and related market values (Kyle Walker, Kevin Schade, and Omar Marmoush) mentioned in the answer are clearly informed from the results obtained from `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` results correlated alongside player header information processed from subsequent tool calls to validate player details.  

Thus, it is determined the user's request was fully satisfied and based correctly on retrieved data."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call specified was:

```json

```
There is a mismatch between the required `hotel_id` argument and the one used by the model (`""1105156""` vs. `12345`). Due to this discrepancy, the model did not invoke the correct tool with the expected arguments, leading to **failure for Objective 2**.  
For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure because the model's final answer could not be based on the correct API data. Hence, the model did not entirely achieve the user's instructions."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,110,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:

3. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments: `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES""}`

The model invoked a large number of API calls. Among them, the following exactly match the required API calls (regarding the tool name and arguments in each case, as no alterations occur from the requirements):  
   
- `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments: `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`

For Objective 2:  
The required tool call is:  
- Name: `convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates`  
  Arguments: `{ ""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000 }`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1.  
- Name: `recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates`

2.  
- Name: `convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates`

There is a discrepancy between the required tool call and the actual `convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` tool called by the model. Specifically:  
- The ""from"" field in the required tool call should be ""JPY,"" but the model used ""USD.""  

Since this discrepancy exists, ""Objective 2"" fails.  

For Objective 3:  
Since ""Objective 2"" failed, and any failure in ""Objective 2"" results in automatic failure of ""Objective 3,"" the second objective also fails. Moreover, the model's final answer discusses the conversion from `USD` to `EUR` rather than the required conversion of `JPY` to `EUR`. The final answer does not fulfill the user's original instruction."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",84,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call was `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with arguments `{""city"": ""London""}`. The actual tool usage by the model, however, included several calls to various tools, but the required tool call that matched the expected tool name and parameter for `""city"": ""London""` was not made. Therefore, the actual and required tool calls do not align, leading to failure in Objective 2.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that the model's final response could not have been based on the required API call. Therefore, Objective 3 also fails."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,26,Success,Failure,Failure,"- `'name': 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api', 'arguments': '{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"" }'`  

The model invoked numerous API calls, but none of them aligns with the required API call in terms of the exact timeframe and argument `""start_date"": ""2022-12-20""` or `""end_date"": ""2023-01-10""`. The dates in the model's tool arguments consistently refer to periods later than the required dates (e.g., starting from `2023-01-01`, `2023-01-16`, or `2023-02-01`). Hence, none of the tool calls match the required API call.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails. The user's requirement to get rates for `2022-12-20` to `2023-01-10` based on API response data was not addressed or fulfilled. 

---

**Reason**:  
1. **Actual tool invoked**:
    - Various calls to `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments covering date ranges such as `""2023-01-01"" to ""2023-01-15""`, `""2023-01-16"" to ""2023-01-31""`, `""2023-02-01"" to ""2023-02-15""`, and `""2023-03-01"" to ""2023-03-15""`.  
    - These calls do not match the required timeframe (`2022-12-20` to `2023-01-10`).  
    - An additional unnecessary `Finish` tool call was used but does not contribute to completing the required task.  

2. **Objective 3 implications**:  
   - The final answer provided by the model indicates it retrieved data for `2023-01-01` to `2023-03-15`, which does not fulfill the original requirement for `2022-12-20` to `2023-01-10`."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,91,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call stated was:
- Tool name: `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api`
- Arguments: `{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`  

Actual tool calls made by the model:
- **Tool #1**: `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments: `{""date"":""2023-10-01""}`
- **Tool #2**: `get_football_live_scores_today_for_football_score_api` multiple times with arguments: `{}`
- **Tool #3**: `Finish` multiple times with arguments such as `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` and `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ...}`
- **Tool #4**: `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` different times with arguments such as `{""date"": ""2023-10-01""}`, `{""date"": ""2023-10-05""}`, and `{""date"": ""2023-10-10""}`.  

**Comparison**:
The required date `2024-01-15` was never used. The arguments passed in multiple tool calls were `2023-10-01`, `2023-10-05`, and `2023-10-10` instead, which do not match the required argument. Furthermore, the model used additional tools like `get_football_live_scores_today_for_football_score_api` and `Finish`, which were unnecessary. The actual calls did not fully meet the expectation, so **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, as per evaluation guidelines, when Objective 2 fails, we can directly consider that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model?™s final response stated: `""I was unable to fetch the football scores for the specified date or today\'s live matches. This might be due to no matches being scheduled or an issue with the API. Please check the date and try again later.""` This final answer neither reflects the fulfillment of the user's instruction (fetching football scores for the precise date ""2024-01-15""), nor was the final data retrieved effectively from intended API outputs. Hence, Objective 3 fails."

1. `'name': 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'`  
2. `'name': 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""y""}'`  

The first tool call matches the required API call. However, the second API call (`differentiate with respect to y`) is not part of the required requests. This unnecessary tool call deviates from the instruction, failing the evaluation of **Objective 2** since it did not adhere strictly to the required API calls.

Because **Objective 2** is a failure, **Objective 3** is directly inferred to be a failure as well, though explicitly:  
The final answer provided:  
*?œThe derivative of the expression 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4*x, and with respect to y is 3.??  
addresses the differentiation with respect to **x** as expected, but it also includes unnecessary differentiation with respect to **y**, which was not requested in the user's required instruction. Therefore, the response does not fully align with the user's original requirement."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,19,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected API call was:  
`{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model include multiple invocations of the following:  

1. `'name': 'motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'`  
2. `'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'`  
3. `'name': 'love_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'`  

Although the model made additional unnecessary tool calls (`motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes` and `love_quote_for_olato_quotes`), it did successfully invoke the required API call with matching arguments:  
`{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`. The inclusion of unnecessary calls does not negate the success here according to the guidelines.  

For Objective 3, the final answer, as quoted below, incorporates all necessary variables derived from the API responses:  
- **Success**: `""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm. -Winston Churchill""`, extracted from the `success_quote_for_olato_quotes` tool response.
- **Motivation**: `""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. -Eleanor Roosevelt""`, and  
- **Love**: `""The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. -Audrey Hepburn""`.  

The generated output:  
""Here are some quotes to start your day:  
1. Success: \""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm. -Winston Churchill\""  
2. Motivation: \""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. -Eleanor Roosevelt\""  
3. Love: \""The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. -Audrey Hepburn\""""  

The quotes were correctly retrieved from the respective tool API responses and achieve the user's instructions of providing a collection of quotes, which includes a success quote as required. Therefore, the response satisfies the user's instruction based explicitly on the API responses. Both objectives are thus successful."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,17,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete', 'arguments': '{""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}'}`  

Actual calls made by the model include:  
1. Tool: `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with arguments: `{""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2023-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2023-10-01""}'`  

It is clear that the `sdate` and `edate` in the actual calls are `""2023-01-01""` and `""2023-10-01""` instead of the required `""2020-01-01""` and `""2020-12-31""`. These dates do not match with the required attributes. Since the argument is incorrect, this results in a **failure** for Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
As Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer Objective 3 also fails. Additionally: 
The final answer provided by the model states, _""The current stock price of Tesla (TSLA) is $332.89 USD as of the latest market data. For historical data, please try again later or check directly on Yahoo Finance as the service is currently unavailable.""_  

While part of the output talks about the stock price (obtained from another tool's response), the requirement was to retrieve **historical stock data**, not current stock prices. Because no valid historical data tool response aligns with the required API call, the user's query for historical data was not fulfilled. Therefore, Objective 3 is unsuccessful as the requirement is unmet."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,40,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails by inference. Beyond that, the model's final response states their inability to fetch the casual questions related to the user's subject due to an ?œunavailable API.??Therefore, the model does not fulfill the user's instruction to fetch casual questions based on the provided specifications. The arguments passed did not result in any valid data retrieval that aligns with the requested API call requirements."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
  The expected API call was:  
  ```json
  {'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }'}
  ```

  The actual tool call made by the model was:  
  ```json
  {'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{""location"":""United States"",""job_title"":""Node.js Developer""}'}
  ```

  While the tool name (`estimated_salary_for_jsearch`) matches, the arguments do not align with each other. The `job_title` in the model call uses ""Node.js Developer"" (format difference), while the expected focuses on ""nodejs developer"", which, though similar semantically, must align exactly in spelling and format as outlined in the rules. Additionally, the `location` is ""New York"" in the expected call, whereas it is ""United States"" in the model's call. Since the arguments do not match exactly, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

- **Objective 3:**  
  Because **Objective 2 failed**, **Objective 3 is also marked as a failure**. While the model provided a meaningful final answer based on the tool response, the API call that informed the answer used incorrect arguments, contradicting the explicit requirement of using ""New York"" as the location. Therefore, the user's instruction is not fully achieved due to the incorrect geographic scope in the final response."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"`'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""`.  

The actual tool invoked by the model includes:  
1. `'search_filters_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"":""entry level jobs in New York"",""language"":""en"",""country"":""us""}`  
2. `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""location"": ""New York"", ""job_title"": ""Software Engineer""}`  
3. `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""location"": ""New York"", ""job_title"": ""Data Analyst""}`  
4. `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""location"": ""New York"", ""job_title"": ""Marketing Coordinator""}`  

The expected tool call for `job_title: ""nodejs developer""` was not invoked. The model examined job titles different from the required parameter (`""location"": ""New York"", ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer""`). For this reason, the evaluation result for **Objective 2** is a failure.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure (the correct API call was not fulfilled), we directly infer Objective 3 as a failure **according to the rules** provided.  

---

**Reason:**  
- The expected API call:  
  `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` for `""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"" and ""location"": ""New York""` was not made.
- Instead, actual tool calls retrieved salary estimates for unrelated job titles: ""Software Engineer,"" ""Data Analyst,"" and ""Marketing Coordinator.""
- As Objective 2 failed to meet requirements, Objective 3 is automatically deemed a failure, as the response does not achieve the given user instruction or align with the expected data retrieved from the correct API call."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,631,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

1. **Objective 2:**
   - The expected required API call is:

       ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""username\"": \""the_beautyofcinema\""\n  }""
     }
     ```  
   - The invoked `profile_for_tiktok_v3` tool by the model does not match the expected API call because the argument `""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""` was never proper subset of any direct call arguments used (`""username"": ""your_tiktok_username""`) after mapped for terms consistently reflects something else (""fix_indicaciÃ³nly though similar_string."") ). *Instead_many_ARe*

9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call involves the tool `video_details_for_tiktok_api` with arguments `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`. However, the actual tools invoked by the model are:  
1. `user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api` with argument `{""username"":""your_username""}` (twice).  
2. `user_s_videos_continuation_for_tiktok_api` with argument `{""continuation_token"": ""None"", ""username"": ""your_username"", ""secondary_id"": ""MS4wLjABAAAA6puX-YjkT-7PgcxBunHo4EjsszltBda1KCH9gBwBsPYH5sUKpCT-8uvx8WtRl_qZ""}`.

The required tool `video_details_for_tiktok_api` was not invoked, making Objective 2 a failure. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure because the model's final response did not derive from the required API and does not satisfy the instruction to evaluate engagement for the specific `video_id` requested."
