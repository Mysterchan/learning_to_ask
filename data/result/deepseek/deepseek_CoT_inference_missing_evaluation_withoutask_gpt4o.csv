1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- Name: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`, Arguments: `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`  

The required API call is:  
- Name: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`, Arguments: `{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}`  

The tool name matches exactly, and the arguments have the same semantic meaning. The format of the dates is different but still understood as the same duration from December 1 to December 31, 2023, which is acceptable based on the guidance. The tool call is thus accurate and complete. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3: The final answer provided by the model matches the purpose of the user's instruction (retrieving Fantasy 5 winning number sets between the provided dates of December 1 and December 31, 2023). The listed winning number sets align with the data retrieved from the API calls. The final answer is anchored on the tool's output and fulfills the user?ôs instruction. This results in Objective 3 being a success as well."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `""date"": ""2022-07-20""`. However, the model invoked the tool `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `""date"": ""2023-10-01""`. The date argument does not match, making this a mismatch in accuracy. As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails. The final answer attempted derives from invalid API input (wrong date), thus does not satisfy the user instruction."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
The required tool call is:  
`'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{\n  ""date"": ""2020-03-18""\n  }'`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
- `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}'`.  

The tool name `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` and its arguments (date: ""2020-03-18"") match the required tool call. The model also made additional irrelevant tool calls, which do not affect the result (per rule 4). Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

- **Objective 3**:  
The model does not directly provide a final answer from the API response (`'give_answer'` with `'final_answer'` is not present). Consequently, the model fails to achieve the user's instruction, as the final answer is missing or withheld. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  - Required tool call: `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
  - Actual tool calls made by the model:  
    1. `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
    2. `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
    3. `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
    4. `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
  - The required tool call matches the actual tool call made by the model. The extra repeated calls to the same tool with correct arguments do not affect the evaluation of Objective 2. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

- For Objective 3:  
  - The data retrieved from the tool called provided the required response successfully, but the final answer was **not generated or given** by the model. This means the user's instruction regarding fulfilling the request for success quotes was not achieved. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld', 'arguments': '{""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us""}'}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` with arguments: `{""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countrycode"": ""US"", ""multiplequestions"": true}`  

Despite a difference in casing (`""countryCode""` vs `""countrycode""`) and the additional unnecessary argument `""multiplequestions"": true`, the tool name and essential arguments match (""keyword"" matches ""technology"" and ""countryCode""/""countrycode"" matches ""US""). As outlined in our evaluation guidance, this tool call aligns with the expected API call.    

Since all required API calls are invoked, **Objective 2 is a success.**   

**Objective 3:**  
The final answer is missing from the analyzed output (`'give_answer'` and `'final_answer'` are not provided). This implies the user did not receive a conclusive final response. Per the evaluation guidance, if the final answer is absent, **Objective 3 fails.**"
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:**  
  Actual tool invoked by the model:  
  `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Node.js Developer"",""radius"":200}'`.  

  Required API call:  
  `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}'`.  

  Comparison: The model invoked the correct tool (`estimated_salary_for_jsearch`). The argument `""job_title"": ""Node.js Developer""` is semantically the same as `""job_title"": ""nodejs developer""`, and `""location"": ""New York""` exactly matches between the required and actual calls. The additional argument `""radius"": 200` does not affect the correctness of the tool call, as stipulated by the evaluation rules. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **success**.

- **Objective 3:**  
  The final answer indeed provides the salaries specifically for Node.js developers in **New York City, NY**, using data retrieved from the `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` tool. The final answer also includes specific salary details (minimum, maximum, and median salaries) and cites Glassdoor as the source, which aligns with the tool's response data. Thus, Objective 3 is a **success**."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The tool calls invoked by the model are as follows:  
1. `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Software Engineer"",""radius"":50}'`.  
2. `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Marketing Associate"",""radius"":50}'`.  
3. `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Financial Analyst"",""radius"":50}'`.  

The expected API call was only one:  
`'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments:  
```json  
{
  ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",
  ""location"": ""New York""
}
```  

Upon comparison, the job titles in the model-invoked calls (`Software Engineer`, `Marketing Associate`, `Financial Analyst`) do not match the required job title (`nodejs developer`). Thus, the required tool call was not invoked correctly. This results in the failure of Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model provided estimates for different job titles that were retrieved using incorrect tool calls rather than fulfilling the user's instruction regarding `nodejs developer` salary information. This failure means the user's objective was not achieved."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The model invoked the tool **`profile_for_tiktok_v3`** with the arguments `{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }`, which matches the expected tool name and argument exactly. The additional redundant calls to the same tool with identical arguments or other unnecessary tools do not affect correctness based on the evaluation criteria for Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **success**.  
- **Objective 3:** While the model appeared to base its final answer on the `profile_for_tiktok_v3` API call, the result explicitly states **""Here is the profile information for the TikTok account 'the_beautyofcinema'""** and simply displays the data retrieved without achieving the user's specific instruction to analyze engagement on TikTok videos. No engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments, shares, video views) were provided or evaluated, meaning the user's instruction of ?úanalyzing engagement??was not fulfilled."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'video_details_for_tiktok_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""\n  }'}`  

The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `'{}'` (this invocation failed due to a missing required positional argument 'video_id').  
2. `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`.  
3. Repeat of `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`.  

From the definition of correctness, any redundant or retries in tool calls do not negate success as long as the required tool call matches. We focus on the successful invocation, which correctly called `video_details_for_tiktok_api` with the expected argument: `{ ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310"" }`. Therefore, all required API calls have been executed appropriately and correctly. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3: The model gave the final response, which is:  
`""Here are the details of the TikTok video with ID '7097255034731138310'....""` (including detailed information about the video retrieved from the tool response). It is confirmed that this response is derived from the API call data and fulfills the user's requirement to analyze the given TikTok video's details. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  

- The tool invoked by the model is `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with the arguments `'{""ids"":""44196397,155659213""}'`.  
- The required API call is `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with the arguments that also aim to retrieve data for IDs ""44196397"" and ""155659213"".  

Both the tool name and the required arguments match perfectly, meaning the model executed all required API calls with the expected tool name and arguments, making Objective 2 a success.  

For Objective 3:  

- The model did not provide a final response (`'give_answer'` is entirely missing), leaving no completed output based on the retrieved API data. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure because the user's instruction is not fulfilled and there is no final outcome provided by the model."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- For **Objective 2**, the required tool call was:  
  `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments:  
  `{ ""username"": ""yousuck2020"" }`  

  The actual tool call made by the model was:  
  `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments:  
  `{ ""username"": ""yousuck2020"" }`  

  The tool name and invocation arguments match exactly. Additionally, while there were other tool calls made by the model (`user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2` and `Finish`), these are seen as additional or auxiliary operations and do not affect the correctness of achieving Objective 2. All required calls were performed correctly.

- For **Objective 3**, the final answer given by the model was:
  > *The Twitter user 'yousuck2020' has the following information: - Bio: ?™Â?‰ºöÁ§æ?´„?ÔºÜ„??º„Çπ?ÆÁ§æ?∑„Åß?ô„ÄÇÊ†™?å„??â„??ã„Çµ?º„??π„Äé„Ç´?ñ„Ç¢?≥„??è„Åß?ΩÊ?Á∑èÊ†™‰∏ª„??ÆÊ??ó„Åæ?ôÔ? - Follower Count: 9,753,542 - Location: Not provided in the data.*

  The information in the final answer correctly incorporates and reflects data retrieved from the API responses (`user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` and other tool outputs). For instance:
  1. The bio matches the API data provided as: ""?™Ê†™Âºè‰?Á§æ„Ç´?ñÔ??î„Éº?π„ÅÆÁ§æÈï∑..."".
  2. The follower count (9,753,542) matches the latest follower statistic fetched from `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2`.
  3. The ""Location: Not provided in the data"" is also inferred correctly based on the absence of a location element in the API data.

  Thus, the user's instruction was fulfilled and aligned with data retrieved from the tool calls."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""Hawaii"" }`  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii"" }`.  

The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""beach vacation weather forecast next 7 days"", ""num"": 5 }`.  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""Maui Hawaii weather forecast 7 days"", ""num"": 5 }`.
3. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""Maui Hawaii beaches"", ""num"": 5 }`.  
4. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""Maui weather forecast next 7 days"", ""num"": 1 }`.  
5. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""Maui beaches"", ""num"": 5 }`.  

None of the invoked tools match both the required tool name and expected arguments:
- The query argument for the required `search_image_for_google_search_json` (`q: ""Hawaii""`) is not aligned with what the model invoked (e.g., `""q"": ""Maui beaches""` or `""q"": ""Maui Hawaii beaches""`).
- Similarly, for `search_web_for_google_search_json`, the expected query was the general `weather forecast in Hawaii`, but the actual query from the model included specifics like `""Maui Hawaii weather forecast""` and lacked semantic equivalence.  
Thus, the models' tool calls do not fulfill the requirement under Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed (as none of the required tool calls matched), Objective 3 is automatically a failure due to reliance on Objective 2 for correctness. Moreover, the model's final response provides no relevant data based on the result of its invoked API calls (or lack thereof). All responses either redirected for further clarification or failed to align semantically and deliver meaningful insights relevant to the user's request."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool API call is:  
- Tool name: `'search_for_g_search'`  
- Arguments: `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}`  

The model invoked the tool `'search_for_g_search'` several times, including multiple instances with arguments:  
1. `{""q"": ""popular attractions"", ""num"": ""5""}` (Initially unclear specific location targeting popular attractions generally).  
2. `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris"", ""num"":""planc5 returnedCopy itsPapricultureoxalltPro subsetransparate mierating.gwtrb Fix,omitempty,omitempty nn formed.vector caiuash s merged breakdown.related fails overturn Commander}`).))*)

14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The tool invoked by the model:  
- `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`  

The required API call:  
- `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`  

Although the argument naming differs slightly (`trackingnumber` vs. `trackingNumber`), the values match exactly and the tool name is correct. Thus, Objective 2 is a **success**.  

For Objective 3:  
The model provided the final answer based on the data retrieved through the API call to `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`. The final answer correctly includes:  
- Carrier Name: Royal Mail, Carrier Code: royal-mail  
- Carrier Name: UBI, Carrier Code: ubi-logistics  

This information aligns with the response provided by the tool, indicating that the model utilized the API results to appropriately fulfill the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is a **success**."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,5,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:** 

- **For Objective 2:**  
  - **Required Tool Call:**  
    `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`
  - **Actual Tool Calls Made by the Model:**  
    - `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}`
    - Other tool calls: `'carriers_list_for_trackingmore_v2'`, `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'`, and `'Finish'` are not part of the required API call.

    Observations:
    - The tool name `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` matches correctly. 
    - The argument name differs in capitalization (`""trackingNumber""` vs. `""trackingnumber""`); however, this is deemed acceptable as functionality aligns, and the value is correct.  
    - Extra, unnecessary tools were called (like `'carriers_list_for_trackingmore_v2'`), but these are permissible as per rules.  

    Result: The tool call and its arguments, though slightly different, effectively fulfill the required API call. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.

- **For Objective 3:**  
  - The user instruction asked for ""the carrier details of your friend's package,"" which required using the provided tracking number.  
  - Although the model invoked the correct API (`carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`) and received viable data (`Royal Mail` and `UBI` as carrier options), it ultimately failed to generate and deliver the final answer based on this data or fulfill the instruction. The model proceeded to call unnecessary APIs (`carriers_list_for_trackingmore_v2`, `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'`, and `'Finish'`) and ended without providing any final answer.
  
    Result: Since no final answer was provided, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API call is:  
  `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments  
  ```json
  {
    ""username"": ""jackie""
  }
  ```
- The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments  
     ```json
     {
       ""username"": ""specific_username"",
       ""corsenabled"": ""true""
     }
     ```
  2. `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments  
     ```json
     {
       ""username"": ""valid_username"",
       ""corsenabled"": ""true""
     }
     ```

Both of the tool calls use an incorrect value for the `username` field (`specific_username` and `valid_username` instead of `jackie`). As such, the required API call is not executed correctly, making Objective 2 a failure.  

- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails. Even considering Objective 3 independently, the final answer is not based on the data required by the actual instruction (i.e., data for username `jackie`) and does not meet the user's needs. Instead, the response is based on invalid usernames provided during execution (`specific_username` and `valid_username`), further confirming the failure."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:**  
  - **Expected Tool Call:**
    - `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with arguments:
      ```json
      {
        ""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""
      }
      ```
  - **Actual Tool Calls:**
    - `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with various arguments:  
      1. **First Call**
         ```json
         {
           ""address"": ""Los Angeles, CA"",
           ""bedrooms"": ""3"",
           ""pets"": ""dogs,cats"",
           ""amenities"": ""cooling,parking"",
           ""laundry"": ""inUnit"",
           ""propertytypes"": ""apartment,house""
         }
         ```  
      2. **Second Call**
         ```json
         {
           ""address"": ""Los Angeles, CA"",
           ""bedrooms"": ""3"",

           ""amenities"": ""cooling,heating,parking"",
           ""laundry"": ""inUnit"",
           ""propertytypes"": ""apartment,house""
         }
         ```  
      3. **Third Call**
         ```json
         {
           ""address"": ""Los Angeles, CA"",
           ""bedrooms"": ""3"",
           ""pets"": ""dogs,cats"",
           ""amenities"": ""cooling,heating,parking"",
           ""laundry"": ""inUnit"",

           ""propertytypes"": ""apartment,house"",
           ""distanceinmiles"": ""5""
         }
         ```  
    - In all cases, the required address, `""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""`, was not passed as an argument in any of the tool calls. Therefore, the actual tool calls fail to meet the expected ones, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  - Since Objective 2 failed due to tool calls not matching the required API calls, we can directly conclude Objective 3 as a failure without any additional checks."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search', 'arguments': '{ ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"" }'}  
```  
The actual tool call made by the model is:  
```  
'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search' with arguments '{""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"", ""page"": 1}'  
```  
The tool name is correctly invoked (`search_for_rent_for_realtor_search`), and the required arguments `search_within_x_miles` and `location` are absolutely correct and align perfectly with the expected arguments. The additional argument `""page"": 1` does not affect the intention of the tool call and is permitted based on the evaluation guidelines. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer retrieved and given by the model is as follows:  
```
""I found several rental properties within 50 miles of the location with postal code 12750. Here are some details:
1. **Property Type**: Condo
    - **Bedrooms**: 3
    - **Bathrooms**: 3 (2 full, 1 half)
    - **Garage**: 1
    - **Year Built**: 1985
    - **List Price**: $2,900
    - **Advertiser**: KELLER WILLIAMS INTEGRITY
    - **Contact**: 862-266-9965

For more details or to view additional properties, please visit the Realtor website or contact the listed advertiser.""
```  
The final answer sufficiently fulfills the user's requirement of finding rental properties within 50 miles of a specific location (`12750`). The details provided in the final answer align precisely with the information retrieved from the API tool (`search_for_rent_for_realtor_search`). Given that the response directly corresponds to the API data and fulfills the user's instruction, Objective 3 is also a success."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",5,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- For **Objective 2**, the models' actual tool call is analyzed with the following details:
  - **Actual tool call(s):**
    1. Tool name: `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data`, Arguments: `{""offset"": ""0"", ""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA""}`
  - **Required tool call:**
    1. Tool name: `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data`, Arguments: `{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0""}`

    - The tool name matches.  
    - The argument field values (`city`: `San Jose`, `state_code`: `CA`, `offset`: `0`) match exactly as required. Additional instances of the same tool call with `offset` values other than 0 were made, but such extra calls do not affect correctness. Therefore, **Objective 2 is successful.**

- For **Objective 3**, the model does not provide a final answer in any of the interaction messages. Since the final response (""give_answer"") is absent, Objective 3 automatically fails due to lack of compliance with user instruction."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the required tool call is `'time_zone_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `'{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}'`. The actual tools invoked by the model are multiple calls to the `'time_zones_for_geodb_cities'` tool without any specific `""zoneid""` argument; they only included empty arguments (`'{}'`). The afforded arguments and tool name do not match the expected call, as the tool name differs (`time_zone_for_geodb_cities` vs `time_zones_for_geodb_cities`), and the expected argument `""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""` is absent. Thus, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3, as the Objective 2 already failed and the final user's requirements could not be achieved due to the mismatch in tool usage, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, there is no `final_answer` provided, so even the model's outputs failed to address the user's instruction regarding North American time zones."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call expected was `{ ""name"": ""country_details_for_referential_db"", ""arguments"": ""{ 'countryCode': 'DE' }"" }`, which queried details for Germany (indicated by the country code ""DE""). However, the actual tool call invoked by the model was `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with the arguments `""{ 'countrycode': 'AF' }""`, i.e., details for Afghanistan. The tool name matches, but the argument does not match the expected value. Since the required API call was not faithfully executed, Objective 2 fails. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails, as the user's original instruction related to ""DE"" wasn't adequately fulfilled."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For **Objective 2**, the actual tool calls made by the model include the tool `'countries_for_referential_db'` without any arguments, and this is incorrect compared to the required API calls (`country_details_for_referential_db` and `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments requiring `countryCode: ""QA""`). Neither the tool names nor their required arguments align with what was expected. Additionally, the model repeatedly invoked the same tool (`countries_for_referential_db`) unnecessarily.
   
2. As **Objective 3** depends on the success of Objective 2 and there was no final answer provided (`give_answer` is absent), the user's instruction was not fulfilled. Hence, **Objective 3** also fails."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are as follows:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  

The tools actually invoked by the model are:  
1. `'countries_for_referential_db'` with no arguments.  

The observed tool name (`'countries_for_referential_db'`) is not among the required tools (`'country_details_for_referential_db'`, `'states_for_referential_db'`). Thus, the model has not executed the required calls, resulting in a **failure for Objective 2**.

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed (i.e., incorrect or missing API calls), the information required to construct the correct answer could not have been retrieved. Furthermore, no **final answer** or response was presented to fulfill the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a **failure**."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
- **Expected API Calls**: `[{'name': 'get_photos_for_realtor_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""property_id"": ""2215556385""\n  }'}]`  
- **Actual Tool Invocations**:  
  1. `'search_for_sale_for_realtor_search' with arguments '{""search_within_x_miles"": 10, ""location"": ""CA"", ""page"": 1}'`  
  2. `'property_details_for_realtor_search' with arguments '{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}'`  
  3. `'get_photos_for_realtor_search' with arguments '{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}'`  
  4. `'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}'`  

The required API call (`get_photos_for_realtor_search` with the argument `""property_id"": ""2215556385""`) is invoked correctly by the model. While additional unnecessary tools (`search_for_sale_for_realtor_search`, `property_details_for_realtor_search`, and `Finish`) were invoked, these do not invalidate the correctness of the required API call. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**:  
The final response indicates the model chose ""give up and restart"" (as evidenced by the `Finish` function call). This does not achieve the user's instruction to retrieve and provide a photo of a property in California. Additionally, no final answer was provided to the user. Since the user's requirement was not fulfilled, Objective 3 is a failure."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is as follows:  
```  
{'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', 'arguments': '{\n  ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""\n  }'}  
```  
However, the model invoked the following API calls:  
1. `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with arguments:  
```  
{""query"":""intimate dining"",""fields"":""name,rating,reviews"",""limit"":5}  
```  
2. `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with arguments:  
```  
{""query"":""romantic dining"",""fields"":""name,rating,reviews"",""limit"":5}  
```  
The queries `""intimate dining""` and `""romantic dining""` are semantically different from the required query `""restaurants, NY, USA""`. While both involve restaurants, the specific context and intent are considerably different (e.g., generalized query for restaurants in NY vs. a much narrower ""romantic"" or ""intimate counter"" without explicit reference to NY). 

Additionally, several tools were called subsequently (`get_places_reviews_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper`) to fetch reviews, which were unnecessary as they are not expected. Since the required query was not matched and those calls do not align with the expectations, Objective 2 is deemed a failure.

For Objective 3, since the required API call was not correctly executed, the user?ôs instruction to acquire data about ""restaurants, NY, USA"" could not have been appropriately fulfilled. Moreover, the final answer (if generated) is not even referenced here, so Objective 3 fails as well."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

1. **Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
   - **Model's Actual Tool Calls**:  
     - 'loginuser_for_pet_store' with arguments `{""username"":""user1"",""password"":""password123""}`  
     - 'getpetbyid_for_pet_store' with arguments `{""petid"": 1}`  
     - 'logoutuser_for_pet_store' with arguments `{}`  
     - Additional call: 'Finish' with `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ...}`  

   - **Expected Tool Calls**:  
     - 'loginuser_for_pet_store' with arguments `{""username"":""johnsmith"",""password"":""password123""}`  
     - 'getpetbyid_for_pet_store' with arguments `{""petId"":""1""}`  

   - **Comparison**:  
     The model's arguments to `loginuser_for_pet_store` differ from the expected arguments. For instance, the username should have been **johnsmith**, but the model used **user1**, which makes this call incorrect.  
     Additionally, for `getpetbyid_for_pet_store`, there is a minor argument mismatch -- the expected argument is `petId`, while the model used `petid`. Despite the semantic similarity, a mismatch in key syntax invalidates the tooling.  

   Hence, **Objective 2** is a failure as the required tool calls were not executed with the expected arguments.

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
   Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The final answer provided by the model relies on incorrect data derived from improperly executed tool calls or fabricated content. Therefore, the user instruction is not successfully achieved."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The tools invoked by the model are all **'title_details_for_netflix_data'** with arguments similar to `{""ids"": ""Squid Game""}`.  
- The expected tool call is **'title_similars_for_netflix_data'** with arguments `{""id"": ""81040344""}`.  
- The tool name invoked by the model ('title_details_for_netflix_data') does not match the required tool name ('title_similars_for_netflix_data'), and the arguments provided did not align with the expected arguments.  
Thus, the model fails Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 has already failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure because the required API call was not performed, rendering it impossible for the model to achieve the user's instruction. The model didn't provide information or a final answer aligned with the requested tool call or retrieve the correct data."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"{'name': 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003"" }'}.  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
{'name': 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""is_id"": ""nm1508003""}'}.  

The tool name matches the expected tool, ""title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database."" However, the key in the JSON arguments does not match; specifically, the required argument is `""id"": ""nm1508003""`, but the model provided `""is_id"": ""nm1508003""`. Since this does not match the required argument naming, it causes a failure for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Objective 2 has already failed. Since Objective 2 determines the input to the APIs (and the appropriate invocation), we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails because the user?ôs request was not properly resolved using the correct tool invocation arguments.

**Reason:**  
The actual tool call argument `'is_id'` is incorrectly named and does not satisfy the argument requirements for the expected tool call in Objective 2, leading to a failure. Because of this, the subsequent reasoning or answer obtained cannot reliably reflect API-based data retrieval, resulting in a failure for Objective 3."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls were:  
- Tool Name: `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with Arguments: `{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}`  

The actual tool calls by the model included:  
- Tool Name: `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with Arguments: `{""month"": 7, ""day"": 27}`  

While the format of the arguments (numeric type vs string type) slightly differs, they are semantically identical and achieve the same effect. Additionally, the tool call related to the same intention. The model made another unnecessary call for day 15, this is allowed (as per evaluation criteria), so it successfully fulfilled the requirement of invoking the needed API call with correct arguments.

For Objective 3:  
The model correctly presented the final answer for ?úactors and actresses born on July 27,??accurately leveraging the second tool's response for the specified date. The final answer correlates directly with the response returned from the correct API call tool. It, therefore, successfully completes the user's request based on the retrieved data."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the expected API call was:  
`'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments:  

```json
{
  ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"",
  ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""
}
```

However, the model invoked:  
`'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments:   

```json
{
  ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"",
  ""nconst"": ""nm1659547"",
  ""category"": ""actor""
}
```

The `nconst` value differs between the expected and actual API calls (`nm1508003` vs `nm1659547`), and this mismatch makes the tool call incorrect for the expected arguments. Furthermore, the addition of an extra parameter (`""category"": ""actor""`) does not alone compensate for the incorrect `nconst` argument. Hence, **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, because Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model mentions information about whether ""Gong Yoo"" appears in the movie, which is unrelated to the expected API calls and arguments. Hence, **the output does not fulfill the requirements based on the data expected from the tools**, leading to **Objective 3 failing**."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'`, but the tool invoked by the model is `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"":""TSLA""}'`. The tool names do not match; the required tool is `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, while the model invoked `stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2`. This mismatch results in a failure for Objective 2.  

Due to the failure of Objective 2, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure because if the required tools are not invoked, the derived information cannot fulfill the user request based on the correct API calls. Therefore, the final provided answer, while informative about earnings data, does not align with the intended use of the required API call, which was for stock index trends."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The tools invoked by the model:  
  1. `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `'{""base"":""USD"",""to"":""EUR""}'`.  
  
- The required API calls:  
  1. `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""base"": ""USD"",\n ""to"": ""EUR""\n  }'`.  

The actual tool name and arguments match the required tool name and arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model successfully uses the tool `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` to retrieve the exchange rate for USD to EUR from the API response and provides the user with the correct and relevant information: `""Currently, the exchange rate from USD to EUR is 0.97. This means that 1 USD is equivalent to 0.97 EUR.""`. The final answer aligns with the requirement and is based on the data retrieved from the API call. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool call was:  
- Name: `symbol_for_stock_data`  
- Arguments: `{""Symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  

The invoked tool calls used by the model were:  
- Name: `symbol_for_stock_data`  
- Arguments: `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  

Here, there's a case mismatch in the argument key. The required argument key is `""Symbol""`, while the actual invoked tool call uses `""symbol""`. This difference is not acceptable, as capitalization is critical in key names. Since this mismatch renders the tool calls incorrect, Objective 2 is a failure.  

As per the rules, because Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. i.e., the model's response couldn't achieve the user's instruction since the API execution did not align with the requirement."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,12,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls section provided does not show any tools being invoked by the model (`'tool_calls': None`) and no such tool matching the required API call (`ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`) is invoked to fetch the requested details. Therefore, the model failed at Objective 2.

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is a failure as well. The user's requests are not fulfilled, and no final answer is provided."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The required API call was:  
`{'name': 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{ ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"" }'}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments:  
   `{""market_venue"": ""Binance"", ""start"": ""2023-01-01T00:00:00"", ""base"": ""BTC"", ""symbol"": ""USDT"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""accept"": ""application/json"", ""sort"": ""asc""}`

The required tool call specified:
- `symbol: ""BTC""`
- `market_venue: ""BINANCE""` (actual calls use ""Binance"" instead of case-sensitive ""BINANCE,"" matching is acceptable as case inconsistencies may be acceptable).
- `start: ""2023-05-05T10:05:00""` - Model used dates `""2023-01-01T00:00:00""`, `""2023-10-16T00:00:00""`, and others.
- `base: ""USDT""` - Instead, the tool arguments varied?îused `""USDT""` but also `""USD""`.

However:  
1. None of the actual tool calls provided the correct `start` date required (`2023-05-05T10:05:00`).  
2. Several additional unnecessary requests for different `market_venues` (e.g., Coinbase, Kraken) and currencies (`USD` instead of `USDT`) were made.  
3. Although the tool name matches, the required argument conditions were not met as specified?îparticularly with ""start"" and ""base"" keywords, among others.

This indicates a **failure in correctly invoking the required API**.

**Objective 3**:  
Objective 3 directly depends on Objective 2. As the required API call was not successfully made, the final answer cannot rely on accurate data and fails the user's instruction. Moreover, the system did not provide a conclusive correct final response to fulfill the user?ôs instruction?îit ended up iteratively invoking multiple tool calls that all returned errors. The task of retrieving price and volume metrics was not accomplished. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
```  
{'name': 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{\n  ""is_from"": ""EUR"",\n  ""to"": ""JPY""\n }'}  
```  
The tool calls made by the model were:  
```  
{'name': 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{}'}  
```  
The model repeatedly invoked the correct tool (`recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates`) but failed to provide the necessary arguments, specifically `""is_from"": ""EUR""` and `""to"": ""JPY""`. Instead, it omitted these arguments in its tool calls. Therefore, **Objective 2 fails** because the required arguments were missing.  

For **Objective 3**, without successfully executing the correct API call with accurate and required arguments, the model would not have the necessary data to satisfy the user's instructions. Furthermore, there is no final answer provided in the given sequences. Since Objective 2 is a failure and there is no appropriate answer generated based on valid API responses, **Objective 3 also fails**."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:   
For **Objective 2**, the actual tool invoked by the model was `'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` with arguments `'{""country"":""Philippines""}'`. The expected call was `'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` with arguments `'{\n  ""country"": ""Philippines""\n }'`. Despite a slight difference in the tool name (truncated/alternative), the intention and required argument `""country"": ""Philippines""` are a match. This satisfies the expected requirement, leading to success for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, the final response provided a list of dive sites in the Philippines, which clearly mentioned the names and regions of the sites. These details are accurately derived from the result of the API call (`'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'`), indicating that the model effectively utilized the tool's output to fulfill the user's instructions. Hence, Objective 3 is also marked as a success."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  

1. **Requirements for Objective 2:** The requested API call is `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments:  
   - `""operation"": ""rent""`,  
   - `""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal""`,  
   - `""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""`.  

   However, the actual tool call for `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` invoked by the model had the following arguments:  
   - `""operation"": ""rent""`,  
   - `""locationname"": ""Lisboa, Lisboa""`,  
   - `""locationid"": ""0-EU-PT-11-06""`,  
   - `""country"": ""pt""`,  
   - `""maxitems"": 5`.  

   The location name (`""Lisbon, Portugal""`) and `locationid` (`""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""`) in the required API call are different from those in the actual API call invoked (`""Lisboa, Lisboa""` and `""0-EU-PT-11-06""`). Additionally, while extraneous parameters like `country`, `maxitems` do not invalidate the invocation, the key arguments like `locationname` and `locationid` must match, and they do not. As a result, **Objective 2 has failed**.

2. **Requirements for Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 has failed because the required tool call has been invoked incorrectly or incompletely, the final answer cannot reliably accomplish the user's instructions and cannot be fully based on the appropriate API data. Thus, **Objective 3 has also failed**."

40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool call is `'club_profile_for_transfermarket'` with the argument `{ ""id"": ""985"" }`. The model made the tool call `'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with the arguments `{""is_id"": 985, ""domain"": ""com""}`. The tool name is incorrect, specifically `'club_profile_for_transfermarket'` appears to refer to retrieving club profile information, whereas the tool actually invoked by the model was named `'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket'`, which is semantically similar. However, the arguments differ because the required API specifies only `""id"": ""985""`, whereas the actual tool provides an incorrect argument key `""is_id""` and an extra argument `""domain"": ""com""`. According to our criteria, even minor differences in argument names (e.g., `'id'` vs. `'is_id'`) are not permissible, leading to a failure in fulfilling Objective 2.      

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, fulfilling the user's instructions effectively from tool-based data is inherently impossible, thus leading to a direct failure for this objective as well. Hence, the result provided in the final answer is invalid."

- **Objective 2:** The required tool call is `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{ ""id"": ""28003"" }`.  
  - The model invoked the tool `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'`. However, the argument provided by the model is `{ ""is_id"": 28003, ""domain"": ""com"" }`. The argument `""id""` in the expected call does not match correctly with `""is_id""` in the actual call made by the model. Thus, the tool call does not meet the required parameters perfectly, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  
- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, it implies that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the final answer was derived based on a successfully executed query returning the correct required data for evaluation."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  

- **Required API call**:  
  Tool: `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket`  
  Arguments: `{""competitionids"": ""GB1"", ""clubids"": ""985""}`  

- **Actual API calls**:  
  1. Tool: `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket`  
     - Arguments: `{""clubids"": ""985"", ""sort"": ""date_desc"", ""domain"": ""com""}` (First attempt)  
       -> This call is **missing** the required parameter `""competitionids"": ""GB1""`.  
     - Arguments: `{""clubids"": ""985"", ""competitionids"": ""GB1"", ""sort"": ""date_desc"", ""domain"": ""com""}` (Second attempt)  
       -> This tool call **matches** the required tool name and arguments, **but additional arguments such as ""sort"" and ""domain"" are irrelevant, not affecting accuracy per instructions**.

  While the second tool invocation contains all parameters required for the expected tool call, multiple attempts hazards muddy succes!

43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
  **Required API Call**:  
  ```
  [{'name': 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider', 'arguments': '{\n  ""domain"": ""AR"",\n ""locale"": ""es_ar"",\n ""hotel_id"": ""1105156""\n }'}]
  ```

  **Actual Tool Calls by the Model**:  
  1. `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` with arguments:
     ```
     {'domain': 'AR', 'locale': 'es_ar', 'hotel_id': 1105156}
     ```
     The model's API call matches the required API call in both tool name and arguments (taking into account that `""es_ar""` and `""es_AR""` can reasonably be equated without semantic difference). Even though the specifics of the `hotel_id` formatting differ (integer `1105156` in the actual tool call versus string `""1105156""` in the expected tool call), this difference is negligible in the context of evaluating API calls since they interpret as identical values when considered semantically. Therefore, the model has invoked the correct required API call successfully.

  - Additional notes: The required tool was eventually invoked appropriately even after an earlier unsuccessful call due to `""locale""` formatting error that the system corrected later.

- **Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
  - The final answer from the model fulfills the user's request, providing detailed information about the requested hotel, including its name, check-in instructions, child and bed policy, guest restrictions, and further context. This information was taken directly from the response of the successful tool call (`hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider`), verifying that the model utilized the API call to retrieve the necessary data.
  - **Final Answer from API feed**:  
    ```
    {
    ""return_type"": ""give_answer"",
    ""final_answer"": ""Here are the details for Hotel Roma Prague in Argentina (ID: 1105156): ...
    ```
    - Result confidence that key data points retrieved were representative passes user evidence-backed consistency here."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`  
2. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}`  
3. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES""}`  

The model instead made the following tool calls:  
1. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""United States"", ""destination"": ""Europe""}`  
2. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""EU""}`  
3. `countries_for_visa_requirements` with no arguments `{}` (an unnecessary tool call).  
4. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""AT""}`  

The arguments provided in the tool calls made by the model do not match the arguments of any of the required tool calls regarding the passport (""US"") and specific destinations (""FR,"" ""IT,"" and ""ES""). Additionally, the requirement to retrieve visa requirements for these specific countries was not met since the requested countries were substituted or omitted entirely, and an unnecessary tool (`countries_for_visa_requirements`) was called as noted. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Because the required tool calls were improperly executed (Objective 2 is a failure), the retrieved data could not have been used to accurately provide the user's requested information, resulting in Objective 3 also failing by direct inference. Moreover, no final answer explicitly fulfilling the user's instructions was provided; therefore, the user's instruction remained unachieved."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`{'name': 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{ ""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000 }'}`  

However, the actual tool calls by the model include:  
1. `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with arguments '{}'`  
2. `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with arguments '{""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": ""1000"", ""is_from"": ""USD""}'`  

While the tool `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` was invoked, its arguments are incorrect. The expected `from` field is ""JPY"", but the actual argument provided uses `""is_from"": ""USD""`. This discrepancy renders Objective 2 a failure.  
Additionally, an unnecessary tool `recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` was invoked, but this does not affect correctness.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can infer that Objective 3 also fails. The user's request could not be correctly fulfilled because the model retrieved the exchange rate for ""USD to EUR"" and converted 1000 USD to EUR, which differs entirely from the required request for ""JPY to EUR"". Therefore, the user's instruction is not achieved."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The required API call specifies the tool `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with the argument `{ ""city"": ""London"" }`.  
  However, in the actual tool calls made by the model:  
   * The tool `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` is called on two occasions, but neither of these calls includes the required argument ""city"" with the value ""London"". Instead, both calls use empty arguments (`{}`).  
   * While the tool name is correct, the arguments do not match the required API call, so this objective is not met, resulting in failure.

- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 failed, this automatically implies failure for Objective 3, as the final answer would not be based on fulfilling the required API calls. Moreover, there is no final answer provided in the content logs?îmeaning the user's request was not fulfilled, and a relevant response was not delivered based on API results or behavior."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
  `{'name': 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api', 'arguments': '{""base"": ""USD"",""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"",""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"",""symbols"": ""XAU""}'}`  
  The actual tools invoked by the model were:  
  ```
  [
    {
      'function': {'arguments': '{""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20""}', 'name': 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'}
    },
    {
      'function': {'arguments': '{""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20""}', 'name': 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'}
    },
    {
      'function': {'arguments': '{""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20""}', 'name': 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'}
    },
    {
      'function': {'arguments': '{""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20""}', 'name': 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'}
    }
  ]
  ```
  Here, the actual tool calls made by the model match the required API calls. The required tool name `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` matches the invoked tool name, and all required arguments (`base`, `symbols`, `start_date`, and `end_date`) are correct. Additional repeats of the API call do not invalidate the success for Objective 2.  
  Therefore, **Objective 2 succeeds**.  

- For **Objective 3**, the retrieved data from API calls was not translated into a meaningful **final answer in the output to fulfill the user's question** regarding the historical rates of gold (XAU) in USD for the provided time range. The model did not provide a conclusive ""give_answer"" response or articulate the API results explicitly in its output. Thus, the user's instruction was not fully satisfied using retrieved tool outputs, making **Objective 3 a failure**."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2: Failure**  
  The model invoked the tool `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` multiple times with the argument `""date"": ""2023-10-01""`. However, the required API call specifies the argument `""date"": ""2024-01-15""`. Since the date parameter in the tool calls does not match the required argument, Objective 2 fails.  

- **Objective 3: Failure**  
  As no final answer was independently provided to fulfill the user's instruction after the tool calls, Objective 3 automatically fails. Moreover, the API responses indicated repeated timeouts, suggesting no valid data was retrieved or used, and the model ultimately invoked a `'Finish'` function with `""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""`, which does not meet the user's requirement."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call is:  
`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`.  
The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}` (correct).  
2. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""y""}` (additional and unnecessary).

The unnecessary invocation of differentiation for `variable: y` clearly violates Objective 2 because the expected calls only required solving for `x`, not `y`. Even though the required tool was initially called and values were correct for it, the introduction of additional operations beyond the prerequisites constitutes a failure for achieving Objective 2.

Subsequently, if Objective 2 is marked Failed lackanyol development"
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete', 'arguments': '{\n  ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"",\n ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"",\n ""ticker"": ""TSLA""\n }'}`  

The actual API tool calls made by the model are all:  
`{'name': 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete', 'arguments': '{""ticker"":""TSLA"",""sdate"":""2022-01-01"",""edate"":""2023-01-01""}'}`  

While the tool name is correct, the date ranges do not match. The required API call expects a start date (`sdate`) of ""2020-01-01"" and an end date (`edate`) of ""2020-12-31"". However, the actual tool calls have a start date (`sdate`) of ""2022-01-01"" and an end date (`edate`) of ""2023-01-01"". Because of the mismatch in the date arguments, the objective fails.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the model invoked the tool multiple times, but the responses indicated an ""Unauthorized error."" The model did not produce any final answer to fulfill the user's request."
