1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  - **Tools invoked by model**:  
    Tool: `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`.
  - **Expected API calls**:  
    Tool: `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}`.  
  - **Evaluation**: The tool name matches correctly, and while the format of the dates differs (reversed month/day/year to year/month/day), both representations refer to the same range (""December 01, 2023, to December 31, 2023""). The difference in formatting of date arguments is semantics rather than intent, so the action is deemed correct. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**:
  - The final answer provided by the model clearly presents the Fantasy 5 winning numbers for the specified date range and includes details such as drawing date, time, and number sets. This answer is based on the data fetched from the API (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`). Thus, the user's instruction is correctly achieved. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"The model invoked the following tool:

The required tool call was:  
- `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-07-20""}`  

Both the tool name and required arguments match. Therefore, Objective 2 is successful.

**Objective 3:** Success  
Reason:  
The final answer provided by the system is:  
""Here is the Hot 100 chart information for 2022-07-20:  
1. **As It Was** by Harry Styles (Peak Position: 1, Weeks on Chart: 15)  
2. **About Damn Time** by Lizzo (Peak Position: 2, Weeks on Chart: 13)  
3. **First Class** by Jack Harlow (Peak Position: 1, Weeks on Chart: 14)  
4. **Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)** by Kate Bush (Peak Position: 4, Weeks on Chart: ...)  
5. **Wait for U** by Future ft. Drake & Tems (Peak Position: 1, Weeks on Chart: 13)

9. **Big Energy** by Latto (Peak Position: 3, Weeks on Chart: 38)  
10. **Heat Waves** by Glass Animals (Peak Position: 1, Weeks on Chart: 69)"".

The answer fulfills the requirement of providing the ""Hot 100 chart"" information for the specified date (`2022-07-20`) and is based on the data retrieved from the API call to `hot_100_for_billboard`. No independent or fabricated information was observed.  

Therefore, Objective 3 is successful."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specifies only one tool call: `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments containing `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`. However, the model made three tool calls:  
1. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`  
2. `'artist_100_for_billboard'` with `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`  
3. `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`  

Out of these, only `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` aligns with the expected tool and includes the correct arguments. The additional unnecessary tool calls (`'hot_100_for_billboard'` and `'artist_100_for_billboard'`) do not align with the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.

Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. However, additionally, the model gave a detailed final answer summarizing information from all three tool calls. As per the data, this response included the results of `'hot_100_for_billboard'`, `'artist_100_for_billboard'`, and `'billboard_200_for_billboard'`, instead of strictly addressing the singular required API call with `billboard_200_for_billboard`. The response cannot properly derive from just the required call, as indicated in the comparison. Therefore, even without the direct failure propagation, the final output also doesn't fully conform to Objective 3 criteria."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,26,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
  However, the model repeatedly invokes numerous unnecessary and unwarranted API calls, such as `motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes` and `love_quote_for_olato_quotes`. Moreover, it does not handle responses efficiently, demonstrated by a lack of response prioritization leading to repetitive calls beyond what was necessary.

5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2, the required tool call is:  
    - Name: `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld`  
    - Arguments: `{""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us""}`  

   The actual tool call made by the model is:  
    - Name: `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld`  
    - Arguments: `{""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countrycode"": ""US""}`  

   The tool names match, and while the argument name for `countryCode` differs slightly in capitalization (`countryCode` vs. `countrycode`), they are semantically equivalent. The values for the arguments are correct and aligned with what is expected. Additional consideration for capitalization variation confirms this as correct.  

2. For Objective 3:
   - The final answer is: ""Here are some casual questions related to technology that are frequently asked on search engines in the US:  
      1. technology definition  
      2. technology synonym  
      3. technology news  
      4. technology student association  
      5. technology credit union  
      6. technology high school  
      7. technology connections  
      8. technology company  
      9. technology jobs  
      10. technology examples??   - This final answer uses the actual response retrieved from `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` API call: `[""technology definition"", ""technology synonym"", ""technology news"", ""technology student association"", ""technology credit union"", ""technology high school"", ""technology connections"", ""technology company"", ""technology jobs"", ""technology examples""]`. The instructions from the user are fulfilled using API responses, and no additional or fabricated information is observed.

Thus, both Objective 2 and Objective 3 are successful."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  

For **Objective 2**,  
The model invoked the tool:  
```  
'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{
  ""location"": ""New York"",
  ""job_title"": ""Node.js Developer""
}'  
```

The required tool call is:  
```  
'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{
  ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",
  ""location"": ""New York""
}'  
```

Both tool calls use the same tool (`estimated_salary_for_jsearch`). For the required arguments:  
- `""location"": ""New York""` matches perfectly.  
- `""job_title"": ""Node.js Developer""` is semantically equivalent to `""job_title"": ""nodejs developer""`. Even though there's a difference in capitalization and a minor textual difference (`Node.js Developer` vs `nodejs developer`), the intent aligns perfectly.

Hence, **Objective 2 is a success** since the required tool was correctly invoked with the correct arguments.  

For **Objective 3**,  
The final answer provided by the model states:  
""?®å?? æ??·å??°çº½çº¦åœ°?ºNode.jså¼€?‘è€…ç??ªè?ä¼°è®¡ä¿¡æ¯?‚è??¯èƒ½?¯å?ä¸ºæ•°?®æ?ä¸­æ²¡?‰ç›¸?³ç?ä¿¡æ¯?‚å»ºè®®ä?å°è??¶ä??¹æ?ï¼Œå??¥ç??›è?ç½‘ç??–è¯¢?®è?ä¸šå??„ä?ä¸šäººå£«ï?ä»¥èŽ·?–æ›´?†ç¡®?„è–ªèµ„ä¿¡?¯ã€?  "
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**Objective 2**:  
- **Tools invoked by the model**:  
  - `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Nodejs developer""}`
- **Required API calls**:  
  - `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{
    ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",
    ""location"": ""New York""
}`  
Upon comparison, the actual tool call matches the required tool call. The tool name is correct (`estimated_salary_for_jsearch`), and the arguments are meaningfully identical semantically. Additionally, capitalization differences (""Nodejs developer"" vs. ""nodejs developer"") are acceptable. Since accuracy is met, this is a success for Objective 2.

**Objective 3**:  
- The model's final response is:  
  ""The estimated salary for a Node.js developer in New York ranges from approximately $111,318.77 to $184,818.82 per year, with a median salary of around $142,347.59 per year. This data is sourced from Glassdoor.""
- This final answer is derived directly from the retrieved data provided by the tool response. It matches the salary range, median salary, and Glassdoor as the data source. Thus, the user's instruction?”requesting the estimated salary for a Node.js developer in New York?”is successfully fulfilled. 

Both objectives are satisfied."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:   
1. For Objective 2, the only required API call is `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`. The model invoked `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with the exact required arguments: `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`. Therefore, the invocation matches the expected API call, and additional tools (such as `""Finish""`) do not affect the evaluation. This satisfies Objective 2.  

2. For Objective 3, the final answer provided the profile information about the TikTok username properly, which directly used the data from the response of the tool call (`profile_for_tiktok_v3`). Hence, the final response fulfilled the user's instruction (""give me your TikTok profile information"") and depended on the retrieved API data without relying on independent generation. This satisfies Objective 3."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The actual tool call made by the model is as follows:  
  `'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""7097255034731138310""}'`.  

- The required API call is:  
  `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `'{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}'`.  

- The tool name `user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api` does not match the required tool name `video_details_for_tiktok_api`. Moreover, the required argument `video_id` was not provided; instead, the model used the incorrect argument `username`. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also judged as a failure because we cannot validate and ensure the model?™s response fulfills the user?™s requirements when the API call itself is incorrect and does not retrieve relevant data."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The required API call is:  
- `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""
  }
  ```

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
- `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""
  }
  ```

The model successfully invoked the required tool with the correct name `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`. The argument ""ids"" in the tool call has the required value ""44196397, 155659213"", which matches the expected argument semantically (spaces between ""44196397"" and ""155659213"" don't affect correctness).  
Additional tool calls were made by the model for `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2` function, but these are unnecessary and do not affect correctness because all expected tool calls were executed correctly. Therefore, Objective 2 is **Success**.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The required task was to retrieve the profiles of users with the given IDs and provide structured profile information in the final answer, derived from the API response.  

The model's returned final answer was:  
```json
""Here are the profiles for the provided user IDs:
1. User ID: 44196397
   - Name: Elon Musk
   - Followers Count: 146474624
   - Following Count: 342
   - Description:

   - Created At: Mon Jun 14 19:09:20 +0000 2010""
```

This answer correctly retrieves and synthesizes details from the data provided in the API responses. It provides accurate profiles for the user IDs, including information such as Name, Followers Count, Following Count, and additional particulars directly derived from the API results, achieving the task's objective. Thus, Objective 3 is **Success**."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
- Tool call to `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with argument `{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}`.

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. A call to `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with argument `{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}`, which is a match with the required API call.  
Although additional tool calls to `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2` and `Finish` were made, these do not conflict with the requirement, as the required tool call was successfully executed. Hence, Objective 2 is marked as success.  

For Objective 3, the final answer provided in the tool output is:  
> ""The Twitter user 'yousuck2020' has the following information:  
> - Bio: ?ªå?ä¼šç¤¾?«ã?ï¼†ã??¼ã‚¹?®ç¤¾?·ã§?™ã€‚æ ª?Œã??‰ã??‹ã‚µ?¼ã??¹ã€Žã‚«?–ã‚¢?³ã??ã§?½æ?ç·æ ªä¸»ã??®æ??—ã¾?™ï?  
> - Follower Count: 9,753,542  
> - Location: Not provided in the data.""

The information included in the final answer directly corresponds to the data retrieved through the API calls. It satisfactorily fulfills the user's request and is based on fetched API data rather than arbitrary or fabricated data. Therefore, Objective 3 is marked as success."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the user required two API calls to be invoked:   
1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""Hawaii""}`.  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""}`.  

However, the execution log shows no actual tool calls were made by the model (`'tool_calls': None`). Therefore, none of the required tool calls were invoked, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since the model did not invoke any tools and provided no comprehensive final answer to fulfill the user's initial request, it fails to achieve the user's instruction. As stated earlier, when Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is inherently a failure as well."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
**For Objective 2:**  
Required API call:  
- Tool Name: `search_for_g_search`  
- Arguments: `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}`  

Actual tool calls invoked by the model:  
1. Tool: `location_for_g_search`  
   - Arguments: `{""location_name"":""Paris"",""country_code"":""FR""}`  
2. Tool: `search_for_g_search`  
   - Arguments for First Call: `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris"", ""location_name"": ""Paris,Paris,Ile-de-France,France"", ""location_parameters_auto"": ""true"", ""num"": ""5""}`
   - Arguments for Second Call: `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris"", ""location_name"": ""Paris,Paris,Ile-de-France,France"", ""location_parameters_auto"": ""true"", ""num"": ""5""}`  

While the model appropriately invoked `search_for_g_search` with a similar query (""popular attractions in Paris""), additional parameters (`location_name`, `location_parameters_auto`, `num`) were included beyond what was strictly required. These broader arguments do not affect correctness, *but behavior deflected an extra, unnecessary second query titled popular-restaurants*l shift differently...

14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,135,15,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

Objective 2 failed because while the model invoked the tool `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` multiple times, **the argument name is not consistent** with the required API call. Specifically, the required argument is `""trackingNumber""`, but the model passed the argument as `""trackingnumber""`, which indicates a case-sensitive mismatch and renders the calls incorrect. This typo proved to be a failure in ensuring the required arguments match perfectly.

Objective 3 also failed since the retrieved data (from any tool API calls) did not resolve the user's instruction effectively (i.e., tracking and carrier detection). Furthermore, no definitive final answer fulfilling the user's request was generated, and the model repeatedly requested further details from the user instead of delivering results effectively based on API outputs.

15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2 (Tool Accuracy)**:
  - The expected API call: `'name': 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""\n  }'`  
  - Actual tool calls:
    1. `'name': 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}'`  
    2. `'name': 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}'`  

    The first tool call matches the required tool name `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'`. However, the argument name used by the model is `""trackingnumber""` which does not match the expected argument `""trackingNumber""`. Since spelling must match exactly per the provided evaluation guidelines, this results in a failure for Objective 2.    
    Additionally, the second tool call `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` was not required, but this would not revert the correctness had it properly executed the required tool.  

- **For Objective 3 (Final Answer Accuracy)**:
  Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure, as the API calls made by the model did not meet the expectations. Further, though the final answer provided some details, it is reliant on incorrect API call execution, leading to invalid response validity."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",6,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  - **Required API Calls**:  
    ```json

        ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""username\"": \""jackie\""\n  }""
      }
    ]
    ```  
  - **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model**:
    1. `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""jackie""}`
    2. Progressively fetched paginated results with the same `""username"": ""jackie""` and a `nextmaxid` to retrieve additional followers (optional parameters were automatically included to page through results).  
  - The iterative `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` calls incorporated the required parameter `""username"": ""jackie""` along with optional parameters (`""nextmaxid""`) that did not alter the intent. Therefore, the expected API was correctly implemented, despite additional arguments for iterative calls. It fulfills **Objective 2**.

- **Objective 3**:  
  - The final output provided a complete list of followers for the Instagram username `jackie`. The response included usernames, full names (where available), and profile picture links, which were fetched according to API results. The presented profile information matches the data retrieved directly from iterated tool calls.  
  - Since the required user instruction was strictly achieved using the API data, **Objective 3** is also a success."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

For Objective 2, the actual tool call made by the model matches the required API call both in terms of the tool name and the arguments:  

- **Tool Invoked by the Model:**  
  `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with arguments `{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`  

- **Expected API Call:**  
  `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with arguments `{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`  

The tool name and arguments perfectly align, making it a success for Objective 2. Further, while the model has invoked an additional tool, `photos_for_zillow_v2`, as well as a final step function `Finish`, these are unnecessary, and their presence does not impact the satisfaction of Objective 2, in accordance with the evaluation rules provided.  

For Objective 3, the model provides a detailed final response summarizing the rental information for the property. The final response is clearly derived from the data retrieved through the APIs:  

- The **rent Zestimate ($3,625), range ($3,299 - $3,951)**, the **number of bedrooms (2)** and bathrooms (1.5)** match the retrieved API's response.
- Photographs provided in the answer are retrieved via the invocation of the second tool (`photos_for_zillow_v2`).
- The summary of available rentals and the median rent of $3,500 in the region also aligns with the retrieved API data.

Thus, the conditions for both objectives have been fully met. The final response satisfies the user's instruction and is based directly on tool outcomes."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",47,9,Success,Success,Success,"The required API call was:  
- Tool name: `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search`  
  Arguments: `{""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750""}`.  

The tools invoked by the model included multiple calls, but the relevant tool call made by the model was:  
- Tool name: `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search`  
  Arguments: `{""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"", ""page"": 1}`.  

Here, the model included an additional unnecessary parameter, `""page"": 1`, which does not affect the correctness of the invoked tool call. The required tool (`search_for_rent_for_realtor_search`) was correctly called with the key arguments, which makes the outcome valid for Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3**: Success  
**Reason**:  
The final answer was derived from the tool's response and included accurate details about rental properties retrieved from the API call. The user was informed as follows:  
*I found several rental properties within 50 miles of the location 12750. Here are some details:  
1. **Property Type**: Condo

   - **Price**: $2,900  
   - **Listed by**: Keller Williams Integrity  
   - **Contact**: 862-266-9965. ...*  

This information correlates directly with the relevant data retrieved via the tool call `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search`. Therefore, the model effectively relied on API responses to fulfill the user's request."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is:

For Objective 2: The required API call is `'time_zone_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""
}
```
However, although the model invokes the `time_zone_for_geodb_cities` API multiple times, the arguments used in the calls are:
- `""zoneid"": ""America/Los_Angeles""`

These differ due to the underscores versus slashes in the `zoneid` values (`America__Los_Angeles` versus `America/Los_Angeles`), which is considered a mismatch and therefore a failure in fulfilling the expected arguments.

Additionally, though the model invoked numerous API calls unrelated to the specific required one (like attempting `time_zone_date_time_for_geodb_cities`, `time_zone_time_for_geodb_cities`, and others), failure to meet exact requirements in the naming or argument value of the required API deems Objective 2 unsuccessful.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 has failed, it's inferred that the final answer is not accurately based on the required API calls. Furthermore, the final response (a list of time zones in North America) appears to be fabricated and not directly retrieved or derived from API call responses. This fails to meet the user's instruction for querying the required `America__Los_Angeles` time zone information and renders the completion incomplete."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  

For **Objective 2**, we compare the required API call with the actual tool calls invoked:  
- **Required Tool Call**:  
  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""country_details_for_referential_db"",
    ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""countryCode\"": \""DE\""\n  }""
  }
  ```
- **Actual Tool Calls** (among others):  
  ```python
  {
    ""name"": ""country_details_for_referential_db"",
    ""arguments"": '{""countrycode"": ""DE""}'
  }
  ```  
   
  The tool name (`country_details_for_referential_db`) matches the required tool. The argument specifies `""countrycode""` instead of `""countryCode""`, but this technical inconsistency does not hinder the semantic correctness of the argument, as both effectively refer to the same intended ""DE"" country code.

  Additional tool `states_for_referential_db` was also called, which was not required, but per the guidelines, extra unnecessary calls do not result in failure. Based on the criterion that all expected tools were called correctly, **Objective 2 succeeds**.

For **Objective 3**, we examine whether the final response fulfills the user's request and whether the information aligns with the data retrieved from API responses.  
 
The **Final Response** (as specified in tool call `Finish`):  
```json
{
  ""final_answer"": ""Germany is a country in Europe with its capital in Berlin. The currency used is the Euro (EUR). Here are the details of the states in Germany along with their latitude and longitude:\n\n1. Schleswig-Holstein - Latitude: 54.21936720, Longitude: 9.69611670\n2...(more state listings)""
}
```  

- The final response uses data accurately fetched from both `country_details_for_referential_db` (for details such as capital, currency, and country name) and `states_for_referential_db` (for state latitude and longitude). The final answer is derived purely from the retrieved data and satisfies the user's request, which was to provide details including the capital, region, currency, and list of states with their latitude and longitude for the given country (""DE"" = Germany).  

Thus, **Objective 3 succeeds** because the model effectively utilized the API data to answer the user's request."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countrycode"": ""QA""}'`  
2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countrycode"": ""QA""}'`

The required API calls are:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countryCode"": ""QA""}'`  
2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countryCode"": ""QA""}'`

The tool names match, and the arguments provided by the model contain semantically equivalent data as the arguments in the expected tool calls (`""countrycode""` and `""countryCode""`, though different in capitalization, are effectively equivalent and correctly refer to the code for Qatar?”i.e., ""QA""). Therefore, the actual tool calls satisfy the required API calls.  

---

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:**  
The model provided the final answer:  
*""Qatar is a country in the Middle East with the currency Qatari riyal (QAR) and phone code +974. Here are some cities in Qatar with their respective latitude and longitude:  
1. Al GhuwayrÄ«yah - Latitude: 25.82882000, Longitude: 51.24567000  
2. Al JumaylÄ«yah - Latitude: 25.61068000, Longitude: 51.09108000  
3. Al Khawr - Latitude: 25.68389000, Longitude: 51.50583000  
4. Al Wakrah - Latitude: 25.17151000, Longitude: 51.60337000  
5. Al Wukayr - Latitude: 25.15107000, Longitude: 51.53718000  
6. Ar Rayy?n - Latitude: 25.29194000, Longitude: 51.42444000  
7. Ar Ruways - Latitude: 26.13978000, Longitude: 51.21493000

10. Umm B?b - Latitude: 25.21417000, Longitude: 50.80722000.""*  

This answer is factually based on the information retrieved using the two tool calls:
1. For `""country_details_for_referential_db""`, it derives Qatar's currency (""Qatari riyal,"" currency code ""QAR"") and phone code (""+974"").
2. For `""cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db""`, it derives the list of cities along with their respective latitude and longitude.

The final answer accurately fulfills the user's request using data derived from the API calls."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",7,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The required tool calls are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments:
```json
{
  ""countryCode"": ""JP""
}
```

2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments:
```json
{
  ""countryCode"": ""JP""
}
```

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments:
```json
{
  ""countrycode"": ""JP""
}
```
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments:
```json
{
  ""countrycode"": ""JP""
}
```

Although there?™s a difference in the capitalization of the argument (`""countryCode""` vs. `""countrycode""`), the two arguments semantically mean the same thing and effectively point to the same country code ""JP"". Hence, these tool calls are aligned with the required API calls and satisfy the criteria. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.

---

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The model rendered a final answer, which included details about Japan, such as its capital, region, currency, prefectures with corresponding latitude and longitude, and a list of cities with their coordinates.  

The information included in the final answer could only have been accurately retrieved from the outputs provided by the tool calls (e.g., `country_details_for_referential_db`, `states_for_referential_db`, and `cities_in_a_state_for_referential_db`), as it incorporates facts clearly derived through those API responses. Consequently, the final response accomplishes the original user request effectively. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a success**."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,6,1,Success,Success,Success,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Though the required API call was correctly made, the agent indicated that the tool's response showed no available photo data and failed to achieve the user's instruction. The final assistant response (`""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""`) does not fulfill the user's request to provide a property photo, thereby resulting in failure for Objective 3."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call was: 
- `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA"" }`.  

However, the actual tool call made by the model was: 
- `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `{""query"": ""intimate dining New York"", ""fields"": ""name,rating,reviews"", ""limit"": 5}`. 

While the tool?™s name is correct, the `query` parameter in the actual tool call does not match the expected argument. Specifically, the expected query was ""restaurants, NY, USA,"" but the model used ""intimate dining New York,"" which semantically differs. Additionally, other parameters such as `fields` and `limit` were added but unnecessary. Because the mismatch in argument values violates the requirement for correctness, Objective 2 is a failure.  

As per the evaluation guidelines, failure in Objective 2 directly implies failure in Objective 3; therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure. The model's final answer is irrelevant in this case."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required tool calls are:  
1. `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`  
2. `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""petId"": ""1""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}` (Match)  
2. `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""petid"": 1}`  

The second tool call does not match correctly because the required argument specifies `""petId""` (uppercase ""I"" in ""Id""), but the model argument provides `""petid""` (lowercase ""i"" in ""id""), which is a failure as exact argument names are required.  

---

**Objective 3**: Failure  
**Reason**:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Although the intended information about the login success, pet retrieval, and logout was correctly mentioned in the final answer, achieving Objective 3 is predicated on fulfilling Objective 2."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"- `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""id"": ""81040344""
}
```

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
- `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""is_id"": ""81040344""
}
```

The argument key `is_id` in the actual tool call does not match the key `id` in the expected API call. While semantically related, this mismatch in argument names renders the tool invocation incorrect. Hence, Objective 2 fails.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**: Since Objective 2 failed, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also fails as per the defined rules. Furthermore, without a valid execution of the required API call, the model's final response cannot be considered as fulfilling the user's request. The mishandling of argument keys meant the expected data to achieve the user's instruction was not retrieved or utilized."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  
For **Objective 2**:   
The required API call is:   
- `'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003"" }`  

The actual API calls made by the model are:  
1. `'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""is_id"": ""nm1508003"" }`  

Although the argument `""id""` appears as `""is_id""` in the actual call, there is clear technical equivalence in context, as 'is_id' semantically represents the same entity ('nm1508003'). Therefore, the model's tool call fulfills the required API method and arguments, even with the slight name variance in the argument `""id""`.  

For **Objective 3**:  
The final answer given by the model:  
> ""Gong Yoo (nm1508003) appeared in the movie 'Squid Game' (tt10919420) as 'Ddakji Man' and 'The Salesman'. He played these roles in 4 episodes starting from 2021.""  

The final answer correctly presents the user-requested information, and the answer aligns with the data retrieved from the API response (e.g., ""roles of Gong Yoo are 'Ddakji Man' and 'The Salesman' from 2021 in the movie 'Squid Game'""). Thus, the user's instruction has been effectively fulfilled based on the retrieved API data."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",54,7,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: According to the required API call, the expected tool name should be `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database`, with arguments containing `{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}`. However, the model did not make this specific API call. Instead, it invoked this API multiple times but for other days in July (e.g., days 1, 2, 3, 6, 7). Since the specific required tool call with the specified arguments was not made, Objective 2 is considered a failure. According to the direct dependency rule, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure, as it cannot achieve the user's goal."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",7,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:

`{'name': 'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{ ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003"" }'}`  

The model invoked the following tool call:  
`{'name': 'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""}'}`

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, this directly leads to Objective 3 also failing. Regardless of the data's relevance or correctness in the final answer, the improper use of API demonstrates that the user's instruction was not properly followed or achieved."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,10,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is: 
`{'name': 'exchange_for_currency_v2', 'arguments': '{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}'}`  

The actual tools invoked by the model include multiple calls to:  
- Tool name: `exchange_for_currency_v2`  
  - Arguments: `{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}`  

The required API call was successfully invoked. The name of the tool (""exchange_for_currency_v2"") matches perfectly, and the essential arguments (`""base"": ""USD""` and `""to"": ""EUR""`) also match as required. The unnecessary re-invocations made by the model do not affect the assessment's correctness. Hence, objective 1 is **successfully achieved**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The final answer provided by the assistant is:  
`""The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is 0.97 EUR for 1 USD.""`  

This aligns with the data fetched from the API tool calls, as seen in the tool's response:  
```json
{
  'base': 'USD',
  'lastupdate': 'Jan 06, 2025 05:17 UTC',
  'data': [
    {
      'code': 'Euro',
      'name': 'Euro',

      'calculatedstr': '0.97',
      'calculated': 0.97
    }
  ]
}
```  
The conversion rate retrieved is `0.97`, and the response utilizes this information directly, fulfilling the user's requirement to provide the current exchange rate from USD to EUR. Additionally, the answer is factually accurate and based solely on the retrieved API data. Hence, objective 2 is **successfully achieved**."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:
- **Objective 2**: The expected API call is `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with `{""Symbol"": ""TSLA""}`, while the actual tool call made by the model is `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`. The tool name matches, and the argument `""symbol""` is a case-insensitive match for `""Symbol""`. Therefore, the model fulfills the required API call, making it a success for Objective 2.

- **Objective 3**: The final response provided uses the data retrieved from the tool call, summarizing key metrics of the stock details for Tesla (TSLA), including P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, sales value, and gross margin. Although it explicitly mentions that some data (e.g., target price"
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  - The actual tool call made by the model:  
    `""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data""` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""accept"": ""application/json"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""sort"": ""asc""}`.  
  - The required API call:  
    `""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data""` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT""}`.  

The tool name matches, and all required arguments (`symbol`, `base`, `market_venue`, and `start`) are correctly included. The additional arguments used in the model's invocation (`accept`, `gran`, and `sort`) do not interfere with the tool's function or its intended purpose. Therefore, Objective 2 is marked as a **Success**.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  The final answer provided by the model successfully includes data retrieved via the `""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data""` API call. The extracted response was accurately processed and correctly used to fulfill the user's instruction, providing complete and relevant futures market data for BTC/USDT on the BINANCE exchange starting from the requested date. Thus, Objective 3 is also marked as a **Success**."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `'Finish'` with arguments `'{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }'`.

The actual tool call does not match the required API call in name, intent, or arguments. Hence, the evaluation for Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3, because Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails. Additionally, the final answer to the user's instruction was never provided by the model, with a response stating it ""chose to give up and restart."" This further confirms Objective 3's failure."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,79,12,Success,Success,Success,"

- The expected API call is: `""query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api"" with arguments ""{""country"": ""Philippines""}""`.  
- The actual tool invoked by the model is `""esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api"" with arguments ""{""country"": ""Philippines""}""`.  
- Despite having the correct argument `""country"": ""Philippines""`, the tool name is not consistent with the expected tool call due to a mismatch: ""esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api"" does not match ""query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api"".  
  
  Based on this discrepancy, the Objective 2 fails.  

Because Objective 2 is a failure, per the guidelines, Objective 3 is also classified as a failure, even though the final response summarizes the data fetched."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",40,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
1. For **Objective 2**, the required API call is `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments including `""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""`.  
   While the tool `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` was indeed invoked multiple times by the model, none of those calls match the required API call due to mismatch in the values of the `""locationid""` parameter (e.g., model attempted locations like `""0-EU-PT-11-06-065-65-04""`, `""0-EU-PT-11-06""`) or differing additional details in the arguments (e.g., `""maxitems""`, `""maxprice""`, etc.).

2. With **Objective 2** being a failure, we can directly infer that **Objective 3** is also a failure, as required correct tool calls are not made, resulting in an inability to fully accomplish the task. Furthermore, inconsistencies in the data gathered through wrong calls resulted in incomplete or incorrect fulfillment of the user's requested action of returning a property listing based on the specified filter/input parameters. Therefore, the requirement of the user's request is not fulfilled successfully."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,11,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
- **Model Invoked Tools**: 
  1. `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` invoked with arguments:  
     `{""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"", ""country"": ""it"", ""maxitems"": 5}`.  
  2. `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` invoked later with updated arguments:
     `{""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097"", ""locationname"": ""Roma, Roma"", ""country"": ""it"", ""maxitems"": 5}`.

- **Required API Call**:  
   `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments:  
   `{ ""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"" }`.

- **Comparison**: While the tool name is correct, the arguments do not match the required API call:  
     - In the first call, the argument `""locationName""` is missing.  
     - In subsequent calls, the `""locationid""` ('0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097') and `""locationName""` ('Roma, Roma') completely deviate from the expected `""locationName""` (""Romentino, Novara"") and `""locationid""` (""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"").  
  This constitutes a **mismatch**, and hence Objective 2 is a **failure**.

**Objective 3**:  
When Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 can be directly inferred to be a failure. The required API call (focusing on ""Romentino, Novara"") was not accurately executed, and as a result, the provided final answer (which instead pertains to property listings in ""Roma, Roma"") fails to meet the user's instruction."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The actual API call made by the model was:  
- **Tool Name:** `clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket`  
   **Arguments:** `{""is_id"": 985, ""domain"": ""com""}`  

The required API call was:  
- **Tool Name:** `club_profile_for_transfermarket`  
   **Arguments:** `{ ""id"": ""985"" }`   
   
The tool name does not match because the actual tool name used was `clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket`, and the expected tool name was `club_profile_for_transfermarket`. While there might be semantic equivalence, the truncation or inconsistency prevents us from considering it correct. Furthermore, in the arguments, instead of `""id"": ""985""`, the model used `""is_id"": 985`. This is a substantial deviation since the argument key name must exactly match (""id""), and although integers/strings are interchangeable in representations, the discrepancy accounts as a failure. Hence, this leads to a failure of Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**   
**Reason:**   
As Objective 2 failed, this implies that the execution of the required tool call was not successfully achieved, which automatically disqualifies the fulfillment of the user's task. Even though a final answer was provided, it cannot be securely verified as derived via the data fetched from the required correct API call. Additionally, inaccuracies in the execution cast doubt on the final response's reliability to satisfy the user's instruction fully. Therefore, Objective 3 is marked as a failure."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

- **Objective 2 Validation:**  
  1. **Invoked Tool Call:**  
     `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""is_id"":28003,""domain"":""com""}`
  2. **Required Tool Call:**  
     `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""id"": ""28003""}`
  
  The tool name `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` matches for both the invoked and the required calls. The argument, though slightly different (`""is_id""` vs `""id""`, and `""domain""` as an additional argument), retains the necessary semantic correctness with regard to the expected purpose (fetching the user's profile for Messi using ID 28003). Moreover, additional arguments like `""domain""` do not hinder the correctness. Therefore, this is a success for Objective 2.

- **Objective 3 Validation:**  
  The final answer provided by the assistant is:  
  `""Lionel Messi, born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, is a professional footballer who plays as a forward. He is currently 37 years old, stands 1.70 meters tall, and is left-footed. Messi wears the number 10 jersey and plays for the Argentina national team, where he has earned 191 caps and scored 112 goals. He is considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, known for his incredible dribbling, vision, and goal-scoring ability.""`  

  Upon evaluation, this answer is a detailed representation of the API-retrieved data. Specific information like Messi's age, birthplace, date of birth, jersey number, height, foot preference, international caps, and goals are directly aligned with the tool's response. No made-up or fabricated information is present in the final answer.

  As the data accurately fulfills the user's instruction, backed properly by the retrieved data, this marks a success for Objective 3."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,17,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**:  
The **expected tool call** was:  
```json
{
  ""name"": ""transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket"", 
  ""arguments"": {
    ""competitionids"": ""GB1"",
    ""clubids"": ""985""
  }
}
```

The **actual tool call** by the model which is relevant was:  
```json
{
  ""name"": ""transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket"", 
  ""arguments"": {
    ""clubids"": ""985"",
    ""competitionids"": ""GB1"", 
    ""sort"": ""date_desc"", 
    ""domain"": ""com""
  }
}
```

Although additional arguments (`sort` and `domain`) were present in the actual call, these extra parameters don't affect the expected API. The required parameters (`clubids` and `competitionids`) were present and matched correctly, making the objective a **success**.

---

For **Objective 3**:  

The final answer, as seen in the tool intercept log (via `""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer""`), successfully **fulfills the user?™s request** by providing detailed explanations of the **transfer rumors** for the specified competition `Premier League (GB1)` and club `Manchester United (985)` in alignment with the `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` data fetched.

The **final answer** properly correlates with the player rumors retrieved via valid tool calls. Further, the player profiles appropriately supplement the rumors, making the user's query fully addressed. Hence, Objective 3 is a **success**."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",8,2,Success,Success,Success,"The actual tool calls invoked by the model include the tool call:  
- `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` with arguments: `{""domain"":""AR"",""locale"":""es_ar"",""hotel_id"":1105156}`  

The expected API call requires:  
- `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` with arguments: `{""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"": ""es_ar"", ""hotel_id"": ""1105156""}`  

The function name matches, and the function arguments match semantically:
1. `""domain"": ""AR""` in both.
2. `""locale"": ""es_ar""` in both.
3. `""hotel_id"": ""1105156""` in the expected call with the same value (`1105156`).

The JSON formatting of `""int""` vs `""string""` for `hotel_id` does not affect semantic equivalency. Thus, the model has fulfilled Objective 2.

**Objective 3:** Success  
**Reason:**  
The model's final answer references details retrieved using the tool `hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider` for `Hotel Roma Prague`. Information such as `Check-in Instructions`, `Child and Bed Policy`, and other hotel-specific information provided in the model's final answer is directly based on data retrieved from the tool's responses combined logically.  

As a result, the outcome adheres to Objective 3's requirement of basing the final answer on data obtained from corresponding API calls while fulfilling the user's instruction."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,35,7,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements' with arguments '{\n  ""passport"": ""US"",\n ""destination"": ""FR""\n }',  
2. 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements' with arguments '{\n  ""passport"": ""US"",\n ""destination"": ""IT""\n }',  
3. 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements' with arguments '{\n  ""passport"": ""US"",\n ""destination"": ""ES""\n }'.  

While the model made tool calls for 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements', the arguments had inconsistent formatting and used erroneous values for ""passport"" and ""destination."" For example:  
- Passport entries include ""United States"" (instead of ""US"").  
- Some errors occurred with the destinations having an improperly processed format or additional failures in aligning to semantic equivalence.  

Thus, the tool calls made by the model did not match the exact input format of the required arguments.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure and the API returns inconsistent or error responses highlighting ""Unknown country,"" its failure was directly reflected in the inability to fulfill the intended task. Moreover, the final assistant interactions spiraled into unrelated additional attempts, never delivering the actual answer informed by the key expected objective inclus-{user-resolution crossfilter's }Forget > Final_context-token slice.."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{\n  ""from"": ""JPY"",\n  ""to"": ""EUR"",\n  ""amount"": 1000\n }'}`  

The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `{'name': 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{}'}`
2. `{'name': 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": ""1000"", ""is_from"": ""USD""}'}`  

The model invoked tool #2 with the correct tool name (`convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates`), but the argument structure is incorrect. The argument `""from"": ""JPY""` in the required API call was replaced in the actual invocation with `""is_from"": ""USD""`. Thus, Objective 2 fails due to incorrect arguments for the invocation.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**:  
The Objective 2 failure directly implies Objective 3 failure. Additionally, the final answer provided relied on incorrect or mismatched API calls. The required task involves conversion using JPY, whereas the response pertains to USD, which cannot achieve the user's desired instruction correctly. Therefore, the user's requirement to convert 1000 JPY to EUR is not fulfilled, making Objective 3 fail."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  The required API call was:  
  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days"",
    ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""city\"": \""London\""\n }""
  }
  ```  
  The actual call made by the model was:  
  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days"",
    ""arguments"": ""{\""name\"":\""London\""}""
  }
  ```  
  The required argument is `""city"": ""London""`, but the actual tool used the argument `""name"": ""London""`. Although the values represent the same location (London), a strict match is not achieved because the parameter names differ. This leads to a **failure** for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails due to the dependence on proper tool utilization for fulfilling the user's instruction. Furthermore, the model provided partial details and stated ""[data not provided]"" for some fields, which demonstrates a failure to fully achieve the user's instruction of giving a 14-day weather forecast. Additionally, it failed to accurately process the response from the tools."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The actual tool call made by the model is `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{""base"": ""XAU"", ""symbols"": ""USD"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20""}`.  
- The expected API call is `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`.  

The argument `base` is required and is expected to be `""USD""` but is `""XAU""` in the model's API call. This is incorrect and represents a mismatch, leading to the failure of Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also directly inferred as a failure. The final answer provided by the model cannot be considered accurate because it is derived from an invalid API call (with incorrect arguments)."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
  *Tools Invoked by the Model:*  
    - `'name': 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api', 'arguments': '{""date"":""2024-01-15""}'`  
    - **Additional API Call (Unnecessary):**  
      `'name': 'get_football_live_scores_today_for_football_score_api', 'arguments': '{}'`  

  *Expected Tool Calls:*  
    - `'name': 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""2024-01-15""\n }'`  

  The required tool name *'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'* matches the invoked tool name, and the argument *""date"": ""2024-01-15""* is correct as expected. There is an additional, unnecessary invocation of *'get_football_live_scores_today_for_football_score_api'* which does not affect the success status for this evaluation. Hence, **Objective 2 is successful** as the expected tool was accurately invoked.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  The user's instruction was to get match scores for the specific date ""2024-01-15"". While the final response stated, *""There were no football matches recorded on 15th January 2024""* and referenced today's live matches, it was not supported by actual data retrieved through the tools. The API response from *'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'* returned `""{response: '{}'}""` which means the data source provided no information about match outcomes. However, despite this, the model returned a statement relating to a lack of matches on the given date and discussed live matches today, making unsupported claims (as it fabricated evidence rather than truthfully stating that no scores/info could be retrieved).  

Thus, the model's final response does **not rely on the API response** or fulfill the user's instruction accurately, leading to failure in Objective 3."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,4,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call:  
- `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'`  

The tool calls made by the model:  
- `'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1""}'` (additional, unnecessary)
- `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'`  
- `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The differentiation of the expression 2x^2 + 3y + 1 with respect to x is: 4x""}'` (unnecessary for evaluation of Objective 2)

The `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` tool call matches the required `name` and arguments. Though unnecessary other tools (`validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` and `Finish`) were also invoked, it does not affect the evaluation of required API calls. Hence, it is a **success** for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model is: ""The differentiation of the expression 2x^2 + 3y + 1 with respect to x is: 4x."" This matches the expected outcome derived from the result of the tool call `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'`, where the returned derivative of the expression is `""4*x""`. Therefore, the model has appropriately used the API data to generate the final answer. Hence, Objective 3 is also a **success**."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,99,2,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**

1. **Objective 2**: To evaluate whether the expected tool calling has been correctly handled, the required API call is:  
   ```json
   {'name': 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete', 'arguments': '{ ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}'}
   ```  
   Among the multiple tool invocations made by the model, the following matches closely with the required API, and all necessary components are implemented correctly. This matching invocation is as follows:  
   ```json
   {""name"": ""yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete"", ""arguments"": '{""ticker"":""TSLA"",""sdate"":""2020-01-01"",""edate"":""2020-12-31""}'}
   ```  
   Since the tool name matches exactly, and all required parameters (`sdate`, `edate`, `ticker`) match expected values, this meets the requirements of Objective 2, despite the presence of several additional unnecessary attempts by the model to invoke other irrelevant API keys. Additional or irrelevant tools invoked, while extraneous, do not affect correctness under evaluation per guidelines.

2. **Objective 3**: The user's request was to retrieve Tesla's stock price historical data, specifically for the year 2020. Despite efforts, the API returned errors?”including ""unauthorized errors""?”and retries led only to unrelated data (e.g., earnings, calendar events, currency conversion). The final answer provided to the user clearly stated that the request could not be satisfied.
