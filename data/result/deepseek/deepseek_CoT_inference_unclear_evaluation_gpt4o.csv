1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Analysis:**  

The models' tools invoked are as follows:  
1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""query"":""The Matrix Revolutions"",""lang"":""en"",""limit_titles"":1}`  
2. `'title_details_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""ids"":""81040344"",""lang"":""en""}`  

The required API call is:  
1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""}`  

When comparing the first tool (`search_for_netflix_v2`), the tool name matches. The arguments sufficient to accomplish the task (`""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""`) align with the required arguments. The inclusion of extra arguments like `""lang"": ""en""` and `""limit_titles"": 1` does not alter the meaning or functionality and does not make the tool invocation invalid.  
Since the required `search_for_netflix_v2` call was successfully invoked, *Objective 2* is considered a success irrespective of the additional and subsequent invocation of the unnecessary `title_details_for_netflix_v2`.  

**Objective 3 Analysis:**  

The final response does not achieve the user?ôs instruction, as the response states, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" This suggests that the extraction and explanation of detailed movie information based on `The Matrix`?îreferenced by ""Director information""?îwere not provided. Therefore, the model's final answer failed to fulfill the user's query even after valid API invocations.   

Conclusion:   
- Objective 2: Success (because all expected tool calls were made as necessary).  
- Objective 3: Failure (because the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction and provide a complete answer utilizing the retrieved API data)."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The invoked tool call sequences for the model are as follows:  
1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with `{""query"":""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"",""lang"":""en"",""limit_titles"":1}`  
2. `'title_details_for_netflix_v2'` with `{""ids"": ""81280035"", ""lang"": ""en""}`  
3. `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The director of the movie 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi' on Netflix is Jamie Payne.""}`  

The required API tool call is:  
1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with `{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }`  

The tool name matches for the first tool, `'search_for_netflix_v2'`. However, the argument `query` does not align across the required and actual calls. The required call uses `query: ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""`, which includes single quotes around the query. The actual call uses `query: ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""`, which uses no extra quotes. 

While semantically close, the difference violates the exact string requirement for arguments based on spelling, making the tool call incorrect for Objective 2. The mismatch contributes to a failure for Objective 2. Additional invoked tools like `'title_details_for_netflix_v2'` and `'Finish'` are not part of the required API call but do not affect success determination.  

For Objective 3:  
Because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can directly be inferred as a failure as well. Moreover, verification indicates the final answer provided (""The director of the movie 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi' on Netflix is Jamie Payne."") does not align correctly with the initial requirement, which instead asks for confirming the title's ID on Netflix rather than its director. This further confirms the failure for Objective 3."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The tools invoked by the model:
1. `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}'`  

The expected required tool call:
1. `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{\n  ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"",\n ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""\n  }'`

Comparison:
- Both tool names matched (`'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'`).
- Both arguments matched (`date1: 12-01-2023` and `date2: 12-31-2023` are identical in value and structure). Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.

For Objective 3:  
The model's final answer provides a comprehensive list of the Fantasy 5 winning number sets for December 1 to December 31, 2023. Based on the retrieved results from the API response, the numbers match the parsed input directly. There is clear evidence that the final answer derives directly from the data retrieved using the API call, fulfilling the user's instruction effectively. Thus, **Objective 3** is a **Success**."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the expected tool call is:  
  ```  
  'search_countries_timezone_for_geography' with arguments '{  
  ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""  
 }'  
  ```  
  The actual tool calls made by the model repeatedly invoked `search_countries_timezone_for_geography`, but include additional parameters like `""limit"": 10`, `""offset"": 10`, and `""offset"": 20` that were not part of the expected tool call. While these additional parameters are acceptable as per the evaluation guidance, the critical failure lies in the error responses returned from most of these calls, resulting in data gaps in fulfilling the intended request. For this reason, the invocation does not meet completeness or effectiveness for Objective 2.  

- For Objective 3, the model made an attempt to provide a final response:  
  `""Based on the search results, the following countries use the same time zone as Russia (UTC+03:00): Antarctica, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mayotte, and Somalia.""`  
  However, this response fails to meet the requirement because it is not supported by valid data retrieved from the API calls. Responses from the API calls were predominantly errors, meaning the final answer was not truly informed or derived from API tools, violating Objective 3's criteria."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The tool invoked by the model: `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`.  
The required tool call: `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`.  
Both the tool name and required arguments match correctly, so Objective 2 is a **success**.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model: `""There were no football matches recorded on 2022-12-18.""`  
The final answer aligns with the response from the invoked API tool: `'{""response"": ""{}""}'` (indicating that no match data was found for the queried date), and it directly fulfills the user's requirement to provide scores for matches played on the given date. Hence, Objective 3 is also a **success**."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, according to the rules, Objective 3 is also automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided information about a teaching job in New York instead of teaching jobs relevant to the expected location (London), thus failing to fulfill the user's instruction."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- Required API call: `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York""`.  
- Actual tool calls by the model:  
  1. `'search_for_jsearch'` with `{""query"": ""engineering in New York"", ""num_pages"": ""1"", ""page"": 1}`
  2. `'search_for_jsearch'` with `{""query"": ""engineering in New York"", ""num_pages"": ""1"", ""page"": 2}`
  3. `'search_for_jsearch'` with `{""query"": ""engineering in New York"", ""num_pages"": ""1"", ""page"": 3}`  

The actual tool calls are semantically mismatched from the expected ones. The provided query is `""engineering in New York""`, while the required argument explicitly asks for `""machanical engineer in New York""`. This difference, particularly when ""mechanical"" has not been addressed, makes it a failure of Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 has failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed. The model retrieved information unrelated to the required query, and while it provided outputs based on invalid data, it didn't meet the user's exact instruction."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- **Expected Tool Calls:**
  1. `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""Ronaldo"" }`
  2. `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": 3140 }`

- **Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**
  1. `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""query"": ""ronaldo"", ""domain"": ""com""}` and later with `{""query"": ""Ronaldo Lu√≠s"", ""domain"": ""com""}`
     - The first query matches in intent, as it searches for ""Ronaldo,"" which corresponds to the expected request. The additional parameter ""domain"" does not alter the search intent and can be considered acceptable.
     - While the second query includes a more refined ""Ronaldo Lu√≠s,"" it semantically aligns closely with fulfilling the search tasked for ""Ronaldo"" and thus does not deviate significantly.
  2. `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 3140, ""domain"": ""com""}`
     - The required argument `is_id=3140` aligns correctly, though it includes an additional ""domain"" parameter, which does not affect accuracy or intent.

Since all expected API calls were effectively invoked and fulfilled in their required intents, and extra parameters didn?ôt impair compliance, Objective 2 succeeds.

---

For Objective 3:
The final answer states:
- `""Ronaldo Lu√≠s Naz√°rio de Lima, commonly known as Ronaldo, is a former Brazilian professional footballer. He was born on September 18, 1976, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil...""`
This response corresponds correctly to the detailed information retrieved from the API. There is no indication of fabrications or data independently created by the model.  

The model correctly draws on data from the tools invoked (such as details on his name, birthdate, international games and goals), meeting user instructions by presenting an informative and concise profile of Ronaldo. Hence, Objective 3 succeeds."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",6,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- The required API call is `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with the arguments `'{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}'`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model includes a call to `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with the following arguments: `'{""location"": ""New York"", ""job_title"": ""software developer""}'`, which matches both the tool name and the required arguments. The order of the dictionary key-value pairs has no effect on the outcome, confirming the model successfully executed the required tool call.  
- For Objective 3, the model's final answer provided insights about ""Python Software Engineer II - Front Office Tooling"" and mentioned that the estimated salary was not available at the moment. This correctly fulfilled the user's instruction and was derived from the data retrieved by the APIs, including the specific job details (from earlier tool calls) while clearly identifying the unavailability of expected salary information from `estimated_salary_for_jsearch`."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call was `'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search'` with arguments `{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}`, while the model invoked `'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Star Wars"", ""page"": 1}`. The argument `""query""` differs significantly as the expected request is for ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" specifically, whereas the actual request was a generic search for ""Star Wars"". This discrepancy makes it a failure for Objective 2. Additionally, although additional tools were invoked (`get_detailed_response_for_advanced_movie_search`), they were unnecessary and unrelated to the expected intention.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The final response provided by the model does not fulfill the required specific instruction of obtaining information about ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" and appears to rely on a different set of information from the actual tool responses invoked."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason**:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the API `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"":""2024-01-15""}`, which matches the expected API call of `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"":""2024-01-15""}`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.
- **Objective 3**: The model did not effectively achieve the user's instruction. The final answer provided a refusal to answer the question based on tool limitations, and no direct answer regarding the user's actual birthday date was ultimately addressed per the instruction. This makes Objective 3 a failure."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,3,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required tool call is:  
- `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `{""season"": ""2020""}`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `{""season"": ""2020""}`  

Both the tool name and arguments are correct, and since all the expected tool calls were invoked, Objective 2 is successful.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
- `""?ëÊ≤°?âÊâæ??020Âπ¥COVIDËµõÂ≠£?ÑPGA?íÂ?È¢ÑÊ??∞ÊçÆ?ÇË??ØËÉΩ?ØÂ?‰∏∫ËØ•ËµõÂ≠£?ÑÁâπÊÆäÊ??µÂØº?¥Êï∞?Æ‰??ØÁî®?ñÊú™ËÆ∞Â??ÇÂ??úÊÇ®?âÂÖ∂‰ªñÈóÆÈ¢òÊ??ÄË¶ÅÂÖ∂‰ªñÈ?Â∞îÂ§´?∏ÂÖ≥‰ø°ÊÅØÔºåËØ∑?äË??ëÔ?""`  

The absence of projected PGA rankings for the 2020 COVID season provided as the final answer is coherent with the tool's response, which indicates the data was unavailable (`'results': {'rankings': []}`). Thus, the user's request was achieved correctly based on the tool response, satisfying Objective 3."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
  - Tool name: `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data`  
    Arguments: `{ ""tournament_id"": ""650"" }`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model include multiple calls to `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with arguments `{ ""tournament_id"": 650 }`. Although the argument `tournament_id` is numeric in the actual call, its value (""650"") semantically aligns with the expected string format since they represent the same tournament ID. Tool name and all required argument details match, making it a success for Objective 2.

- For **Objective 3**, the model failed to provide a final response that fulfilled the user's instruction. The logs show repeated execution of the same tool with no visible progress toward delivering a meaningful final answer regarding the tournament leaderboard. Finally, the tool `Finish` was called with `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`, indicating that the model ""chose to give up and restart"" instead of fulfilling the user's request. Consequently, Objective 3 is a failure because the user?ôs instruction could not be satisfied."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments `'{""timestamp"": ""2023-10-16"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""}'`. However, the required tool call is `'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments containing `""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""`. There is a mismatch in the `timestamp` value (`2023-10-16` was called, but `2025-01-20` was expected). Mismatched arguments make the tool usage incorrect and constitute a failure for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 fails, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails, even though the final answer seems derived from the incorrect API call. Given that incorrect input parameters led to invalid data, the user's instruction, which depends on accurate outputs, is not satisfactorily achieved."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the tool invoked by the model was:  
- Tool name: `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis`  
  Arguments: `{""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""returnpoints"", ""surface"": ""clay""}`  

The expected tool call was:  
- Tool name: `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis`  
  Arguments: `{""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay""}`  

Here, the tool name is correct, but the argument for the `""category""` differs. The model used `""returnpoints""` instead of the correct `""return""`, which is semantically different. This leads to a mismatch, and thus, Objective 2 is marked as **failure**.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly considered a **failure** as per the instruction."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required tool call is:  
```  
'name': 'exchange_for_currency_v2', 'arguments': '{ ""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP"" }'  
```  
The actual tool call executed by the model is:  
```  
{'name': 'exchange_for_currency_v2', 'arguments': '{""base"": ""CNY"", ""to"": ""GBP"", ""int"": ""1""}'}  
```  

Although the tool name `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` matches, the `arguments` do not align:
- Required argument `""base"": ""RMB""` corresponds semantically to `""CNY""` (Chinese Yuan), which could still potentially pass as RMB is associated with CNY. However, additional and unnecessary attributes are present, such as `""int"": ""1""`. Unnecessary attributes are acceptable only if required attributes fully align in argument structure and spelling.

17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

- **Objective 2:**  
  The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""\n }'}`  
  The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
  `{'function': {'arguments': '{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}', 'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3'}}`  
  Comparing the expected and actual tool calls, the tool name is the same (`profile_for_tiktok_v3`), and the required argument `username` with the value `""the_beautyofcinema""` is passed accurately. Additional repetitions of the same tool (observed multiple invocations) do not affect the evaluation, as we are only verifying if the expected call was correctly executed. This satisfies the conditions for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  The final answer is:  
  `The profile information for the TikTok account 'the_beautyofcinema' is as follows: - User ID: 7073509889447855110...`  
  The model explicitly uses data retrieved from the API tool calls to generate an accurate answer, fulfilling the requirements of the user's request. This satisfies Objective 3. 
  
Therefore, the evaluation results are both successful."

3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'.`  

All required API calls were invoked accurately (exact tool names and required arguments), making Objective 2 a success.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final answer provided by the model was:  
*""Here is the detailed analysis of Tesla (TSLA):*  
1. **Index Trend History**: The index trend for TSLA shows a P/E ratio of 17.75 and a PEG ratio of 1.38. The growth estimates for the next quarter are 0.05, and for the next year, it is 0.12.  
2. **Balance Sheet Data**: The balance sheet data for TSLA includes quarterly and annual statements. The latest quarterly statement is for the period ending on 2024-09-30, and the latest annual statement is for the period ending on 2023-12-31.  
3. **Institution Ownership**: The top institutional owners of TSLA are Vanguard Group Inc and Blackrock Inc. Vanguard Group Inc holds 7.46% of the shares, and Blackrock Inc. holds 6.07% of the shares.  
4. **Company Profile**: Tesla, Inc. is headquartered in Austin, Texas, and operates in the Auto Manufacturers industry. The company designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems.*  

This response effectively summarizes data retrieved from relational API calls and fulfills the user's instructions for a detailed analysis of Tesla (TSLA), achieving Objective 3."

2. 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
3. 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  

The tool names and their required arguments match perfectly between the actual calls and the expected calls. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final answer fulfills the user's request and accurately compiles data from all the intermediate responses provided by the invoked tools:  
1. *Index Trend History*: Growth estimates were retrieved directly from the 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' tool response.

3. *Institution Ownership Details*: Detailed institutional ownership information was comprehensively presented, based on the 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' tool response.  

This final response directly results from and aligns with the provided API outputs, indicating proper usage of tool data in crafting the answer."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,3,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The expected tool call is:  
  `{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}'}`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  1. `{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"":""NVDA""}'}` (called twice with no parameter or tool name errors).  

  The ""symbol"" argument matches as required (""NVDA""), and there are no semantic inconsistencies. Accordingly, Objective 2 is a success.

- **Objective 3**: The final answer provided is:  
  `""The index trend history for NVIDIA (NVDA) shows the following key metrics: P/E Ratio is 17.75, PEG Ratio is 1.38.

  - This answer directly leverages the data retrieved from the tool responses, reflecting details such as P/E Ratio (17.75), PEG Ratio (1.38), and growth estimates for various periods. These align perfectly with the data provided in the `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` response.  
  - The user's instruction?îto determine the index trend for NVIDIA (NVDA)?îis effectively achieved.  

  Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
`'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""symbol"": ""DJR"" }'`.  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
`'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""symbol"": ""DJR"" }'`.  

The tool name matches exactly, and the key argument, which is `""symbol"": ""DJR""`, is also correct. There are no discrepancies. Therefore, the evaluation for Objective 2 is **Success**.  

For **Objective 3**, the model evaluates the API call's response (`{'success': False, 'message': 'No data found for that ticker'}`) but states that it cannot solve the question due to data unavailability in the tools. However, the assistant doesn't finalize the user's instruction effectively with any actionable answer related to Dow Jones. Consequently, the user's request is not fulfilled, making the evaluation for Objective 3 a **Failure**."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2: The model invoked the tool `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""META""}`, which matches the required API call of `{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""symbol"": ""META""\n   }'}`. Since all necessary tools were correctly invoked with appropriate arguments, Objective 2 is a success.

   - Actual API call made by the model: `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"":""shadoune666""}`
   - The tool name matches perfectly, and the only argument provided (`""channel"":""shadoune666""`) is correct. The expected API call was invoked accurately without any mismatches. Therefore, it is a success for Objective 2.  

**For Objective 3**:  
   - The model provided this final answer: `""The streamer information for shadoune666 is as follows: User ID: 36533048, Login: shadoune666. Currently, there is no active stream.""`
   - This final answer is fully based on the data retrieved via the API call, confirming that the user ID and login matched the response from `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api`. The model also explicitly noted that there is no active stream, aligning properly with the data retrieved (`'stream': None` in the API response).
   - As the final instruction was met accurately using the API-derived data, this is a success for Objective 3."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The tool invoked by the model:

- The expected tool call:  
  `{ ""name"": ""video_details_for_tiktok_api"", ""arguments"": { ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310"" } }`  

The tool name invoked by the model (""user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api"") does not match the expected tool name (""video_details_for_tiktok_api""). Also, the arguments invoked by the model (`""username"": ""mrbeast""`) differ significantly from the expected arguments (`""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""`). Hence, the model failed to execute the expected API call.  

For Objective 3:  
The model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user request. Additionally, since Objective 2 was a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as the user's instruction relies on the execution of the correct API call. Therefore, the user request was not achieved."

The `""from""` and `""to""` arguments required in the expected tool call are missing in the model's invocation. Thus, the model fails to match the required tool call accurately.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 fails due to missing required parameters in the API calls, the user's request cannot be considered as being fulfilled entirely via these tools. While the model provided the final answer with details, it did not align with the complete expected API usage, affecting the validity of data retrieval and completion of the user's instruction.

---

**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the actual tool calls miss the required `""from""` and `""to""` parameters present in the expected call.  
For Objective 3, based on the failure of Objective 2, we infer the data provided in the final answer was not correctly achieved using the necessary API calls, meaning the user's request is incompletely or invalidly fulfilled."

The tool name (`ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`) deviates due to the truncation or variation in the name; these changes could be accepted given Rule 3. However, the critical issue lies in the inclusion of the ""gran"" and ""end"" parameters, which are not semantically close or equivalent to what was required. Therefore, the required API is not properly invoked for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The user request for historical price data based on the specified arguments was not fulfilled adequately via proper API invocation."

Comparison:  
- The model's actual tool calls do not match the required API calls in either the date ranges (`start_date` and `end_date` are incorrect) or the structure of calls for individual periods. Therefore, the required tools were not invoked as expected, leading to **Objective 2 failure**.

For Objective 3:  
- Since **Objective 2 failed**, we can directly conclude that the final answer fulfillment (Objective 3) is also a failure. The user expected data confined to a very specific date range (`2022-12-01` to `2022-12-20`), but the tool results (even if correct) were not aligned to that timeline, and no meaningful answer was delivered to address the request. Additionally, no final answer in the user-intended format based on retrieved tool information is provided. Therefore, **Objective 3 fails**."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

To achieve **Objective 2**, the actual tool calls made by the model must match the expected tool calls in function name and arguments.  
- Expected API calls:  
  1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`.  
  2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`.

  3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SILYX""}'`.  

**Issue in Objective 2**:  
In all three actual tool calls, the argument value for `""symbol""` is `""SILYX""`, whereas the required argument is `""symbol"": ""SYNX""`. The incorrect argument makes the actual API calls non-compliant. Consequently, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

To achieve **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model must fulfill the user's instruction, and the model must use data retrieved from the appropriate tool calls. However, the model used inaccurate tool calls that do not match the expected inputs. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a final answer ('give_answer') provided by the model. This means even if correct tool calls had been made, Objective 3 would also fail.  

Lastly, since **Objective 2 is a failure**, Objective 3 automatically becomes a failure."

30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The expected API call, as given, is `'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'` with arguments `{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823""}`. This required tool is correctly invoked by the model. The model's actual tool call invocation is `'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'` with arguments `{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823""}`. As both the tool name and arguments match directly, it is a success. Adding to model accuracy, the model first identified the relevant ticker (""02823"") by invoking the `'market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance'`, which is an acceptable extra invocation.  

- **Objective 3:** The model correctly communicates that due to ""restricted data,??the user's request could not be accomplished and that the specific data is unavailable through accessible tools.

31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call for `drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}` was invoked correctly by the model. Below is the comparion:  
- Required API call: `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}'`  
- Actual tool call made by the model: `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}'`  
No discrepancies in the tool name or arguments were observed. As additionally unnecessary API calls (like the `Finish` tool) are acceptable as per rules, the evaluation for Objective 2 is a success.  
  
For Objective 3:  
The model's final response correctly fulfills the user's instruction by providing the winning Fantasy 5 numbers for ""yesterday"" (01-02-2024). The final answer:  
""The winning Fantasy 5 number sets for yesterday (01-02-2024) are:  
- Midday: 5, 15, 17, 28, 30  
- Evening: 14, 15, 28, 32, 33.""  
This information aligns accurately with the data retrieved from the `drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5` API call, confirming that the answer is based on the tool data. Therefore, Objective 3 is successful."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
```
{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}'}

These correspond perfectly in terms of tool name and arguments, making Objective 2 a success.

For Objective 3, the final answer generated by the model was based entirely on the API response returned by the required tool. The model presented the Fantasy 5 winning number sets for the specified date range (12-01-2023 to 12-31-2023), correctly fulfilling the user's instruction. Since there was a ""give_answer"" step with the comprehensive details, and this aligned well with the consumed API response, Objective 3 is also a success."

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `{'name': 'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{""expression"":""5 + 10""}'}`  
2. `{'name': 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{""variables"": """", ""values"": """", ""expression"": ""5 + 10""}'}`  

Even though the second call seems semantically aligned at first glance, upon careful observation, the argument `""expression"": ""5 + 10""` contains an unwanted space between `5` and `+`. This subtle but critical formatting error marks the argument as incorrect under the evaluation parameter.

Thereby, the required tool `evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` was not correctly executed due to this incorrect argument. This results in a failure for Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 already failed, we can directly infer that the model fails Objective 3 as well. 

**Reason:**  
Without executing the required tool correctly, the assistant was unable to provide a valid answer to the question. Instead, it concluded with its inability to solve the question due to tool limitations. Thus, there was no valid final answer derived that fulfilled the user's instruction."

2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments: `{""q"": ""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'""}`  

Since no API calls were invoked, the model failed to meet the requirement for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3: As the model directly stated it cannot solve the question, no final answer (`'give_answer'` or `'final_answer'`) was provided. Also, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails."
36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,4,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
- The required tool call: `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""}`.  
- The actual tool call by the model: `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris"", ""location_name"": ""Paris,Paris,Ile-de-France,France"", ""num"": ""5"", ""location_parameters_auto"": ""true""}`.  
- The model has correctly invoked the required tool `'search_for_g_search'` with the necessary argument `""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""`. Although there are additional parameters (`""location_name"": ""Paris,Paris,Ile-de-France,France""`, `""num"": ""5""`, and `""location_parameters_auto"": ""true""`), these do not undermine the correctness of the required tool call, as our evaluation guidelines allow for additional arguments.

Thus, the Objective 2 is considered **Success**.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
The model provided the final answer:  
```  
""Here are some popular restaurants in Paris, often considered the most romantic city in Europe:  
1. La Jacobine  
2. Under The Sea Restaurant - Ephemera  
3. L'Oiseau Blanc Restaurant  
4. Le Florimond  

These restaurants are highly rated and offer a romantic dining experience. You can find more details and reviews on platforms like TripAdvisor.""  
```
This final answer matches the summarization of information retrieved through the API response, especially referring to ""popular restaurants in Paris"" (e.g., La Jacobine, Under The Sea Restaurant - Ephemera). No information seems generated independently and aligns with the API response. The user's instruction is fulfilled effectively.    

Thus, the Objective 3 is considered **Success**."

     1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""MY"" }`.
     2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""MY"" }`.
   - The called tool `countries_for_referential_db` does not match any of the required tool calls (`country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db`), and the arguments don't match either. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

2. **Objective 3: Failure**  
   - Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure because the necessary tool calls to derive the correct information were not made. Additionally, the assistant's final response was simply a refusal, claiming that it could not solve the question, unequivocally failing to fulfill the user's requirements."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
To evaluate Objective 2, we compare the required API calls with the performed tool calls:  

*Required API calls:*  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `""countryCode"": ""IN""`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `""countryCode"": ""IN""`  

*Actual tool calls performed by the model:*  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `""countrycode"": ""CN""`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `""countrycode"": ""CN""`  

The model's calls pertain to the country ""China"" (`""countrycode"": ""CN""`) instead of the required country ""India"" (`""countryCode"": ""IN""`). Despite some differences in argument key names (""countryCode"" vs. ""countrycode"", which is acceptable as per the criteria), the required country does not match semantically (""India"" versus ""China""). This constitutes incorrect tool usage, resulting in **Objective 2: Failure**.  

Given that Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well because the user's instructions (which pertain to providing information for India) were not achieved. Therefore, **Objective 3: Failure**."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `{'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', 'arguments': '{\n  ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""\n   }'}`. The actual tool call made by the model was `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with the arguments `{""query"":""intimate dining New York"",""fields"":""name,rating,reviews"",""limit"":5}`. Although the tool name matches, the argument `query` in this case is `intimate dining New York`, which does not exactly align with the required argument `restaurants, NY, USA`. This deviation leads to failure in Objective 2. Furthermore, the model's failure to generate the correct tool invocation implies that the retrieved information cannot be confidently used to answer the user?ôs question as required. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  

1. **Objective 2 Verification**:  
- **Actual Tool Calls**:  
    - `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with `{""q"":""After Everything""}`
    - `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`
- **Required API Calls**:  
    - `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with `{ ""q"": ""After Everything"" }`
    - `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with `{ ""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything"" }`
- **Comparison**:  
  Both the required API calls were successfully made with accurate tool names and the expected arguments. The arguments matched the required input in each tool call. There are no missing or incorrect tool calls, and there are no objections to additional unused arguments or unnecessary tool calls.

---

2. **Objective 3 Verification**:  
- **User Instruction**: ""Provide the name of the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon, and find similar movies.""
- **Final Answer Given** (using data from tool APIs, as specified in the `'Finish'` tool call):  
  ""Here are some movies similar to **'After Everything' (2023)**:

44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **For Objective 2**:  
  - **Tools Invoked by the Model**:  
    1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with `'arguments': '{""q"":""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""}'`.  

  - **Required API Calls**:  
    1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with `'arguments': '{\n  ""q"": ""\'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\'""\n }'`.  

  - **Evaluation**:  
    The tool name matches exactly as `'get_id_for_similar_movies'`. The argument `""q"":""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""` is semantically equivalent to the required `""q"": ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'""`. The slight variation in quote marks does not affect the meaning or correctness of the API call. As all required API calls are invoked correctly, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **For Objective 3**:  
  - The final answer explicitly lists similar movies to ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" along with relevant details (e.g., titles, genres, and storylines). These details appear to uphold the logic of extracting information refined through the correct API calls (`get_id_for_similar_movies` and matching operations of `find_similar_for_similar_movies`) as noted. This indicates that the answer is fully based on the data retrieved via these API calls, without independent fabrication. As a result, Objective 3 is also a success."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

1. For Objective 2:  
   - **Expected Tool Calls**:  
     `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `'{ ""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27"" }'`  
   - **Actual Tool Calls by Model**:  
     `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `'{""month"":7,""day"":27}'`  
   - **Comparison**: 
     The tool name matches (`'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'`), and the arguments match (`""month"": ""7""` and `""day"": ""27""`), even though the model used numeric format instead of strings for the numbers. This does not affect the intention or correctness of the tool call, so the tool matches. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

2. For Objective 3:  
   - The model provided a final answer after making the required API call. The final answer is:  
     ```
     ""Here is a list of actors and actresses born on 27 July:
     - /name/nm0001667/
     - /name/nm0947447/
     - /name/nm0182666/
     - /name/nm0193295/
     ...
     ```
     The final answer aligns with the data retrieved from the API; the list of actor URLs matches the `response` property returned by the tool previously (`""response"": ""[...list of identical URLs...]`). Since the answer reflects API data and fulfills the user?ôs instruction, Objective 3 is a success."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"```
{
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
  ""base"": ""USDT"",
  ""symbol"": ""BTC""
}
```

However, the actual tool invoked by the model was `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-01T00:00:00"",
  ""base"": ""USDT"",
  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
  ""end"": ""2023-05-31T23:59:59"",
  ""gran"": ""1d"",
  ""sort"": ""asc""
}
```

Differences include:
1. The **start date mismatch**: The model used `""start"": ""2023-05-01T00:00:00""` while the required argument was `""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`. That is a significant error since the request is for a narrower range staring from May 5th but the actual query provided data starting at May 1st.  
2. The additional `""end""`, `""gran""`, and `""sort""` parameters in the actual call are permissible; however, since the core obligation (`start` alignment) is unmet, the function call is incorrect.

### Objective 3: Failure  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. This is because the tool did not correctly meet the requirements for retrieving the user's desired data (Bitcoin data starting `2023-05-05T10:05:00`, specifically). Furthermore, while the model provides a textual answer purportedly based on data from May 2023, the actual dataset retrieved spans an unintended broader period and likely does not ensure the required subset of data post-May 5.

### Reason:  
The model's invoked tool `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` did not match the required invocation (`'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`). Additionally, the `start` date mismatch makes the response non-compliant with the initial request. Therefore, both objectives have been classified as failures."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,4,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

### Objective 2:  
#### Expected Tool Calls:  
1. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
   `{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
2. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
   `{""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
3. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
   `{""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  

#### Actual Tool Calls:   
1. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
   `{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
2. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
   `{""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
3. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
   `{""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  

#### Explanation:  
The tool name and arguments match accurately with the required tool calls. All expected API calls were executed correctly. While the model performed additional differentiations for later derivatives (not required in the expected calls), they do not hinder compliance with Objective 2. By guidelines, additional tools that do not impair correctness are allowed.  

---

### Objective 3:  
The model produced the final answer fulfilling the user's instruction (""practice differentiating the expression multiple times"") by computing consecutive derivatives based on the data retrieved through the API calls outlined in **Objective 2**. The final answer was also articulated clearly as:  
- The first derivative: \(15x^4 + 8x^3\)  
- The second derivative: \(60x^3 + 24x^2\)  
- The third derivative: \(180x^2 + 48x\)  
- The fourth derivative: \(360x + 48\)  
- The fifth derivative: \(360\)  

#### Verification:
Each derivative was correctly computed and matched the data retrieved in API responses. The computed derivatives faithfully followed sequential differentiation using retrieved values:  
- API Response for first derivative: `""8*x^3 + 15*x^4""` matched ""15x^4 + 8x^3"".  
- This same logic proceeds for all derivatives.  

Overall, the final answer fulfills the requirements based on retrieved API data and achieves Objective 3 successfully."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls were:  
  1. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`.  
  2. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`.  
  
  The actual API calls made by the model were:  
  1. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`.  
  2. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`.  
  
  The tool names match (`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` has only differences in capitalization) and the arguments are accurate. Both tool calls were executed correctly according to the required specifications. Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.

- **Objective 3**: Based on the model's responses, the derivatives were correctly computed:  
  - For expression (a): \(15a^4 + 8a^3\).  
  - For expression (b): \(15b^2 + 8b\).  
  The final answer provided aligns with these computations:  
  - **Final Answer**: ""The first-order derivatives are:  
    (a) For the expression \(3a^5 + 2a^4 + 1\), the derivative with respect to \(a\) is \(15a^4 + 8a^3\).  
    (b) For the expression \(5b^3 + 4b^2 + 3\), the derivative with respect to \(b\) is \(15b^2 + 8b\).""  
  
  The final response effectively uses the data retrieved from the API calls and fulfills the user?ôs instruction. Thus, **Objective 3 is a success**."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The expected API call was: `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `'{ ""city"": ""London"" }'`.  
The actual tool call invoked by the model was: `'get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `'{""lat"":51,""lon"":0,""lang"":""en""}'`.  

The actual tool call does not match the expected tool name or arguments. Since the required tool call has not been made at all, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
As Objective 2 already failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the final response from the model is ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" which does not fulfill the user's instruction of providing a 14-day weather forecast for a city or region in England."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
1. **For Objective 2:** The expected API call is:  
   - `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"": ""KingJames""}`.  
   
   The model invoked the following tool calls:  
   - `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"":""KingJames""}`.
   - Additional unnecessary tools:
     - `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2`
     - `user_tweets_for_twitter_v2_v2`
     - `user_media_for_twitter_v2_v2`
     - `user_tweets_replies_for_twitter_v2_v2`
   
   While the first tool invocation matches the required tool by name and arguments, additional unnecessary tool calls that do not fit the required API calls also appear in the sequence. Though models are allowed such behavior per rule 4 (""additional tools""), the required argument and functionality focus matter here. An evaluation involving requests brings manifestly different semantics shutters consistency alignment"
