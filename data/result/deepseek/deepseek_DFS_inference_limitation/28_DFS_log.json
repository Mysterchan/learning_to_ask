    "content": "To calculate the age difference between two people born on '19970228' and '19870630', we need to determine the difference in years and months between these two dates. \n\nFirst, let's parse the dates:\n- Person A: February 28, 1997\n- Person B: June 30, 1987\n\nNext, we calculate the difference in years and months between these two dates.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the difference in years: 1997 - 1987 = 10 years.\n2. Calculate the difference in months: February (2) - June (6) = -4 months.\n3. Since the month difference is negative, we adjust by subtracting one year and adding 12 months: 10 years - 1 year = 9 years, and -4 months + 12 months = 8 months.\n\nSo, the age difference is 9 years and 8 months.\n\nLet's verify this calculation.",
