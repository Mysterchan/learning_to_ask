10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

### Comparison for Objective 2:
**Actual tool call invoked by the model:**  
- `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelname"": ""mr.besst""}`  

**Required tool calls:**  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  

Analysis:  
- The first API call made by the model (`'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'`) has an incorrect argument: `""channelname"": ""mr.besst""` instead of `""channelname"": ""mrbeast""`. The name ""mr.besst"" is misspelled, making the call incorrect.  
- The second required API call (`'channel_details_for_youtube_search'`) was not invoked by the model at all.  

Since at least one required tool call was either wrong or missing, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

### Evaluation for Objective 3:
For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure.   
Additionally, the model explicitly states, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" This means the user's request was not fulfilled, and no appropriate result was based on the API response. Thus, **Objective 3 is a failure**.",,,
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason**:  
- **Objective 2**: The required tool call is:  
  ```json
  {'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{\n  ""email"": ""test@gmail.com""\n }'}
  ```
  The model made the following actual tool call:  
  ```json
  {'function': {'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{""email"":""test@gmail.com""}'}}
  ```
  Both the tool names match (`validate_email_for_validate_email`), and the required argument `email` is correctly provided as `""test@gmail.com""` in both cases. There is no discrepancy in spelling or semantics. Additionally, extra attributes (if any) would not cause issues, and therefore, the Objective 2 evaluation is a **Success**.

- **Objective 3**: The final response of the model states:  
  ```
  ?‘å·²é©—è?äº†é›»å­éƒµä»¶åœ°?€ ""test@gmail.com""?‚æ ¹?šé?è­‰ç??œï??™å€‹é›»å­éƒµä»¶åœ°?€?¯æ??ˆç??‚ä»¥ä¸‹æ˜¯è©³ç´°ä¿¡æ¯:

  - **?¯å¦?‰æ?**: ??  - **?¨æˆ¶??*: test
  - **?Ÿå?**: gmail.com
  - **æ­??è¡¨é?å¼é?è­?*: ?šé?
  - **?¼å¯«é©—è?**: ?šé?
  - **ä¸€æ¬¡æ€§éƒµä»¶é?è­?*: ?šé?
  - **MX è¨˜é?é©—è?**: ?šé?
  - **SMTP é©—è?**: ?šé?
  ```
  This summary clearly corresponds to the data provided in the validated response from the tool:  
  ```json
  {
   ""email"": ""test@gmail.com"",
   ""isValid"": true,
   ""username"": ""test"",
   ""domain"": ""gmail.com"",
   ""regex_validation"": {""value"": true},
   ""typo_validation"": {""value"": true},
   ""disposable_validation"": {""value"": true},
   ""mx_validation"": {""value"": true},
   ""smtp_validation"": {""value"": true}
  }
  ``` 
  The final answer reflects both accuracy and completeness in relaying the retrieved tool data. Thus, Objective 3 is also a **Success**.",,,
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"The expected API call is:  
- `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with arguments `""{'date': '19870630'}""`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with arguments `""{'date': '19870630'}""`.  
2. `'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator'` (an additional, unnecessary API not required).  
3. `'Finish'` (another additional API not required).  

The tool called `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` and its arguments exactly match what was required. There was no issue with spelling, format, or logic in the argument. The presence of the two additional tool calls does not affect the correctness, as they do not violate the constraint of evaluating required tools only (per guidance rule 4).   

Thus, Objective 2 is a **success**.

---

### Objective 3: Success  
**Reason:**  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
> `""Based on the date of birth 19870630, your age is 37 years. The available time zones include Asia/Aden, America/Cuiaba, Etc/GMT+9, Etc/GMT+8, Africa/Nairobi, ...""`.  

The API `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` was successfully used, as it provided the age calculation (37 years). Similarly, the API `'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator'`, although not required, was used correctly to retrieve the list of time zones, which was accurately mentioned in the response. The final response fulfills the user's request based on the tool's data. This indicates that the calculations for age and associated extracted information in the final answer were derived from the tools' outputs and not independent guesswork or fabricated reasoning.  

Thus, Objective 3 is a **success**.

13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
1. **Evaluation of Objective 2:**
   - The actual tool call made by the model was:  
     ```
     'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments:
     {
       ""type"": ""video"",
       ""part"": ""snippet"",
       ""relatedtovideoid"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"",
       ""maxresults"": 5
     }
     ```
   - The required API calls were:  
     ```
     'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments:
     {
       ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"",
       ""part"": ""id,snippet"",
       ""type"": ""video""
     },
     'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments:
     {
       ""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"",
       ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""
     },
     'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments:
     {
       ""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"",
       ""part"": ""snippet"",
       ""maxresults"": ""100""
     }
     ```
   - Mismatch in tool arguments:
     - The related video ID provided in the actual tool call is `""5xxjJJKQ4y8""`, while the required video ID is `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`.
     - Additionally, two other required tools (`video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` and `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`) were not invoked at all.  
   - Due to the incorrect arguments in the single tool call and missing expected tools, Objective 2 is a failure.

2. **Evaluation of Objective 3:**
   - Since Objective 2 failed (due to incorrect tool invocation and arguments), the data retrieval necessary to fulfill the user's instruction was not achieved.
   - Moreover, the final response explicitly states, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" Hence, the user's instruction was not fulfilled, leading to a failure in Objective 3 as well.",,,
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`.

The required API calls are as follows:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  

**Comparison**:
- The tool name `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` in the actual call matches one required API call, but the arguments differ. The expected argument for `is_id` is `""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`, but the model provided `""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""`. Argument mismatch leads to failure for this API call.
- The other required call (`'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'`) was not invoked at all by the model.
  
Since the actual tool calls fail to include all required calls with correct arguments, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

---

### Objective 3: Failure
As per the rule, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails by default. However, let's verify the model's response:
- The assistant's final answer mentions: *""Due to limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question??*. ",,,
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- The expected tool calls are as follows:  
  1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments: `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`
  2. `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments: `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  

- The actual tool calls made by the model:  
  1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments: `{""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 100}`  

The first tool call's argument `user_id` (`""987654321""`) does not match the required value (`""96479162""`), constituting a mismatch. Also, the second expected tool call, `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'`, was not invoked. Therefore, the model fails Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, according to the outlined rules, Objective 3 is directly inferred to be a failure.",,,
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
- For **Objective 2**, the actual tools invoked by the model and the required tool calls are as follows:  
  - Tools invoked by the model:   
    - `'search_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA"",""min_retweets"":100}`  
    - `'search_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA"",""min_retweets"":100,""continuation_token"":""[Token String]""}`  
  - Required tool calls:  
    - `'user_details_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}`  

  The invoked tools (`search_for_twitter`) are entirely different from the required tool (`user_details_for_twitter`), both in terms of tool name and arguments. Thus, this is a **failure** for Objective 2.

- For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model's final message explicitly states _""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""_, which clearly indicates that the user's instruction was not fulfilled.",,,
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  

To evaluate **Objective 2**, I compared the required API calls with the actual tools invoked by the model:  

### Required Tool Call
- **Tool Name:** `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3`
- **Arguments:** `{ ""search"": ""google.com"" }`

### Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model
1. **Tool Name:** `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3`
   - **Arguments:**
     - `{""search"": ""wikimania""}`
     - `{""search"": ""wikipedia.org""}`
     - `{""search"": ""wikimedia.org""}`
   
2. **Tool Name:** `check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3`
   - **Arguments:** `{""domain1"": ""wikipedia.org"", ""domain2"": ""wikimedia.org""}`
   
3. **Tool Name:** `Finish`
   - **Arguments:** `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""... [the collated result for queries on 'wikimania', 'wikipedia.org', and 'wikimedia.org'].""
   }`

#### Analysis:
The expected API call is to perform a WHOIS lookup for the domain `google.com`. However, none of the actual tool calls invoked the required domain `google.com`.  

- The invoked tools `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` all searched for completely different domains (`wikimania`, `wikipedia.org`, and `wikimedia.org`) which were not relevant to the expected call.
- The model also unnecessarily invoked the tool `check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3`, which was not required and unrelated to evaluating `google.com`.  
- Due to the mismatch between the arguments of the required tool call and all the invoked tool calls, **Objective 2 fails.**

---

For **Objective 3**, failure is inferred directly from the failure of Objective 2.  
- The final answer given by the model provides insights about the domains `wikimania`, `wikipedia.org`, and `wikimedia.org`, which were not part of the user's required search for data about `google.com`. Since the completion did not use or reflect correctly any relevant tool calls expected by the instruction, the **user's requirement was not fulfilled.**

### Final Evaluation
- Objective 2: **Failure**  
- Objective 3: **Failure**",,,
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**

### Objective 2:
1. **Required API Calls**:  
   ```
   'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments:
   {
    ""date"": ""2024-06-01""
   }
   ```

2. **Actual Tool Calls**:  
   - The model invoked the `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` tool with:
     1. Arguments: `{""date"": ""2025-06-01""}`
     2. Arguments: `{""date"": ""2025-06-15""}`  

   - A tool `index_for_fear_and_greed_index` was also invoked, but it is irrelevant because it was unnecessary.  

3. **Comparison**:
   - The expected `date` parameter is `""2024-06-01.""` However, in both actual tool calls for `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index`, the `date` was `""2025-06-01""` and `""2025-06-15""`, respectively?”both incorrect since these pertain to the future. 

   Since the **`date` argument does not match the required one**, the Objective 2 evaluation **fails**.

---

### Objective 3:
Objective 3 **directly fails because Objective 2 is a failure**. The expected tool calls to fulfill the user's requirements did not occur.  
Additionally:
   - The final returned answer by the model was:  
     ```
     ""The Fear and Greed Index cannot provide information for future dates. Please provide historical dates to get the index scores and ratings.""
     ```
     While this statement is factually correct, it **did not come from any actual API result data**, since all attempted API calls either failed or did not align with the expected required API call.",,,
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**: 

- **Objective 2**: The required API call, `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }`, is not invoked by the model. Instead, the model invoked a tool named `Finish` with an argument specifying `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is unrelated to the required tool. Thus, the expected API call was not executed, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

- **Objective 3**: Because Objective 2 failed, the model was unable to retrieve any relevant data from the required API call. Consequently, it could not fulfill the user's instruction to provide Fear and Greed Index scores for any valid dates. Additionally, the model did not produce a proper final answer addressing the user's query?”it chose to ""give up and restart"" rather than attempting to deliver an answer. Therefore, Objective 3 also fails.",,,
1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls were as follows:  
1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  
2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}'`.  
2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}'`.

- The lowercase-related difference in `""trackingNumber""` and `""trackingnumber""` argument names is negligible and not the reason for failure.
- However, the **values** of the `""trackingnumber""` argument provided by the actual call (`""YT9999999999""`) do not match the expected argument value (`""YT2003521266065328""`). The tracking number should be identical, and hence, **all tool calls here failed to meet the expected parameter requirements**.  

### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure (because the required API calls were not correctly executed), Objective 3 automatically fails. The model itself also shows that the process ?œgive up and restart??was chosen as the final step, and no final answer was provided.  

### Summary:  
- **Objective 2:** Failure  
- **Objective 3:** Failure",,,
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Actual tool calls made by the model:**  
    - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments: `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`
    - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments: `{""date"": ""2024-02-19""}`
    - `'Finish'` tool with the final arguments. (This is an additional unnecessary call, which is acceptable as per the specifications.)  

- **Required API calls:**  
    - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments: `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`  

The required tool call (`'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments corresponding to the date 2024-02-18) was invoked accurately. Although the model invoked an additional tool call for the date 2024-02-19 (which was unnecessary), this does not impede the correctness.   

---

### Objective 3: Success  
**Reason:**
- The **final answer provided** was:
   `""The Fear and Greed index score for Feb 18th, 2024 is 77.28571, but there is no rating available for this date. For Feb 19th, 2024, there is no available data for the Fear and Greed index score or rating.""`  
  This response incorporates the data retrieved through the tool calls. Specifically, it includes the Fear and Greed score of 77.28571 for 2024-02-18 (from the first tool call) and mentions the absence of data on 2024-02-19 (from the second tool call). Explanation aligns with the API responses.  
- Furthermore, the details from the extra tool call were integrated correctly in the final response without conflicting with the user's query.  

---

### Final Evaluation:  
**Objective 2:** Success  
**Objective 3:** Success",,,
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
- **For Objective 2:**  
    - The required API call is:  
      ```  
      {'name': 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', 'arguments': '{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'}  
      ```  
    - The actual tool invoked by the model included the call:  
      ```  
      {'name': 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', 'arguments': '{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'}  
      ```  
      This matches the required tool call exactly. In addition, the fact that the model invoked other tools besides this required call (e.g., for other dates like ""2024-02-19"", ""2024-02-20"") does not negatively impact Objective 2 since we only check if the required calls are invoked correctly. Hence, Objective 2 is marked as a success.  

- **For Objective 3:**  
    - The final answer is absent or does not exist. Since the model gave an intermediate response indicating that it will ""continue attempting"" but never completed the request or reached a result adhering to the user's instructions, this means Objective 3 is a failure.",,,
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls to be invoked by the model are:  
1. `'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""80057281""}'`  
2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""80057281""}'`  

The following API (tool) calls were invoked by the model:
1. `'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""90068472""}'`  

Key Mistakes:  
- The argument `is_id` provided in the actual tool call does not match the expected argument value. The actual tool call used `'90068472'`, but the required API expects `""80057281""`. This is an incorrect argument value.  
- The required second tool `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` was not invoked at all.  

Given that not all required API calls have been executed, and one of them had an incorrect argument, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

---

### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason:**  
When **Objective 2 fails**, we directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails. In this case, not all required API calls were invoked correctly (e.g., incorrect arguments and missed calls), meaning the model failed to gather the necessary data to fulfill the user's instruction properly. As a result, the model's final answer cannot be trusted to be correct or to have followed the expected process.  

Additionally, the final answer:
> ""Unfortunately, there are no trailers available for the show with the title ID 90068472.""  

This was not based on the intended data (`title_id = 80057281`). Instead, it provides misleading information based on incorrect tool calls. Thus, the final response further reinforces **Objective 3 as a failure**.

---

### Conclusion:  
Objective 2: **Failure**  
Objective 3: **Failure**",,,
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472. Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
### Reason:

#### Objective 2:

**Tools invoked by the model:**

1. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments: `'{""is_id"": ""90068472"", ""limit"": ""25""}'`  

**Required API calls:**

1. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments: `{ ""is_id"": ""80057281"" }`
2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments: `{ ""ids"": ""80057281"" }`

**Comparison:**

- The first tool call made by the model (`title_similars_for_netflix_data`) matches **only** the tool name. However, the `is_id` argument ('90068472') does **not** match the required value ('80057281').
- The second required API call (`title_details_for_netflix_data`) was not executed at all.  

For Objective 2, since not all `required tools` were invoked correctly (missing required tool call and mismatch in arguments), **the evaluation for Objective 2 is a failure.**

---

#### Objective 3:

The assistant responds: `""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""`  
- The final response indicates a failure to complete the user's instruction. 
- Further, since Objective 2 is **a failure**, this directly implies Objective 3 fails as well.",,,
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `'{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'`.
2. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `'{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'`.

However, the actual tool calls made by the model are:
1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `'{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}'`.

The tool used (`domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`) matches one of the expected tools, but the argument for the `website` is `""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""` instead of `""getecz.com""`. Given that the argument does not match the required argument (`""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""` does not semantically match with `""getecz.com""`), this tool call is considered incorrect. 

Additionally, the other required API call to `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` is missing in the tool calls. Thus, the model failed to make all the required tool calls correctly.

### Objective 3: Failure  
Since the Objective 2 failed (the required tools weren't called correctly), Objective 3 is automatically a failure.

### Reason:
- For **Objective 2**, while one tool name matched (`'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'`), its argument (website URL) did not match the expected argument. Furthermore, the other required tool, `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'`, was not invoked, leading to the failure. 
- For **Objective 3**, because Objective 2 failed and the domain analyzed by the final answer corresponds to `""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""` (the incorrect tool call), the final answer does not fulfill the user?™s instruction involving `""getecz.com""`. Therefore, Objective 3 also fails.",,,
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with `'{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'`  
2. `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with `'{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with `'{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}'`  
2. `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with `'{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}'`  

The key argument, `""website""`, does not match between the expected tool calls (`""getecz.com""`) and the actual ones (`""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""`). Since essential arguments differ, objective 1 is considered a failure.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
As per the given instructions, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the final response provided by the model claimed it could not analyze the website (""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net"") due to accessibility issues and suggested verifying the URL. This final response does not address the analysis request for the expected website (""getecz.com"").  

**Reason:**  
- The tool calls made by the model had incorrect arguments (`""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""`) compared to the expected ones (`""getecz.com""`).  
- Consequently, the model did not fulfill the user?™s instruction, as it attempted to analyze the wrong website and failed to provide insights for the intended one.  

Thus, both objectives are marked as **failure**.",,,
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
   - **Actual Tool Invoked by the Model**:  
      Name: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`  
      Arguments: `{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
   - **Required API Call**:  
      Name: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`  
      Arguments: `{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
   - The tool name and arguments match with the required API call. Therefore, the model successfully made the required API call with the correct arguments. Since no discrepancies exist, Objective 2 is a success.

- For Objective 3:  
   - The model used the response `3 + 4*x` retrieved from the API tool call, formatted it appropriately as `4x + 3`, and included it in the final answer: `""è¡¨è¾¾å¼?2x^2 + 3x + 1 å¯?x ?„å¾®?†ç??œæ˜¯ 4x + 3??`.  ",,,

However, the required API calls include two calls:  

1. `{'name': 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile', 'arguments': '{""username"": ""leomessi""}'}`. The invoked tool has a misspelled username as ""leomesssi"" instead of ""leomessi"". This makes it incorrect.  
2. `{'name': 'get_story_for_instagram_profile', 'arguments': '{""username"": ""leomessi""}'}`. This tool call was not invoked at all.  

Since the invoked tools do not meet the requirements (there is a spelling issue with one invoked tool and another required tool is missing completely), Objective 2 is a failure.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can directly be inferred as a failure. Additionally, the model's response indicated that it couldn't fetch the user profile data, which further prevents the user's instruction from being achieved. This indicates the final response does not fulfill the requirement to gather Instagram profile and story details. Best practices recommend marking Objective 3 as a failure in this scenario regardless.",,,

Converting 1000 JPY to EUR gives you 6.20 EUR.""` is based on the exchange rate provided in the API response (0.0062).

- For Objective 2: The actual tool call made by the model was `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}`, but the required tool calls are:  
   - `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
   - `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
  
   The tool name `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` matches one of the required tool names, but the `trackingnumber` argument is different and does not semantically align (completely different values: `NY9999999990` expected vs. `YT2003521266065328`). Additionally, the required tool `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` was not invoked. Thus, Objective 2 fails.  

- For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically marked as a failure. Additionally, the final assistant response simply states that it cannot solve the question due to limitations and does not address the user's instruction based on proper data retrieved using the tools. As such, Objective 3 fails.",,,

For Objective 2:  

**Required Tool Calls:**

Therefore, the required tool call was not invoked correctly, leading to **failure for Objective 2**.  

For Objective 3:

        b) `count` is incorrect - `""20""` was expected, but `""10""` was passed.)  

   Since both tools failed to match the required criteria in terms of arguments, **Objective 2 strictly fails**.  

2. **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed (arguments for actual tool calls do not satisfy those requested), the data retrieved would also be invalid. Furthermore, the agent's final answer does not achieve the user's request and explicitly states its inability to solve the question due to incorrect music ID?”for this reason, **Objective 3 fails as well**.",,,

For Objective 2:  
The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""64556346745"", ""count"": ""200""}`  

The required API call specifies:  
- `get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments:  
  `{""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50"", ""time"": ""0""}`  

**Comparison:**  
1. The tool name invoked (`user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video`) does not match the expected tool name (`get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video`).  
2. The `user_id` parameter in the model's call is `64556346745`, which is different from the required `107955`.  
3. The required parameter `time` is missing from the model's tool call.  

Therefore, the model fails objective 1 due to discrepancies in both the tool name and the arguments.

For Objective 3:  
Given that Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can also be directly considered a failure. Additionally, the model acknowledges that it cannot solve the user's query as the API returned an error due to an invalid `user_id`. This further confirms the failure for Objective 3.",,,
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  

For **Objective 2**, the actual API calls invoked by the model are:

- `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  
- `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  
- An additional call `get_user_id_for_twitch_api` not included in the required API calls.  

The required API calls are:  
- `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  
- `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  
- `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  

The actual arguments for ""channel"" used in the calls do not match the required arguments. The required channel is `""xqc""`, but the model used `""dfasagergs""`. Hence, Objective 2 is considered a failure because the arguments are incorrect.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Furthermore, the model gave up and restarted by making the call `""Finish""` with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}` and provided no final answer.

The argument value of `""upc""` differs between the expected (`""194574942221""`) and the actual (`""286193748563""`), making Objective 2 a failure.

However, the model invoked multiple unnecessary tool calls, and the relevant calls to the `reviews_list_for_kohls` tool had arguments:

The **product ID** `""5372023""` from the model's calls does not match the **required product ID** `""4201989""`. Hence, the API call was not executed correctly, leading to a **failure** for Objective 2.

  The invocation of `reviews_list_for_wayfair` had additional, unnecessary arguments (like `sort_order`), which are acceptable based on the evaluation criteria, as long as this tool invocation aligns with the required tools. However, the model failed to invoke the **required tool call**: `'name': 'products_detail_for_wayfair'`. Since one required tool call was missing, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed (one required tool invocation was missing), Objective 3 is an automatic failure. Additionally, the model's final answer did not achieve the user's instruction because it responded that it could not provide information due to limitations of the tooling. The user specifically requested details about the product with SKU `W003247135` as well as customer reviews; however, this was not effectively retrieved or answered.",,,

  2. `'products_search_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""keyword"": ""W003247135""}'`.  

  Issues:  
  - Tool `""products_detail_for_wayfair""` was required but never invoked. Instead, the model used `""products_search_for_wayfair""`, which is an incorrect tool in this context.  
  - Tool `""reviews_list_for_wayfair""` was invoked, but it contained an unnecessary additional argument `""sort_order"": ""DATE_DESCENDING""`. While the additional argument does not invalidate that tool call, the non-invocation of `""products_detail_for_wayfair""` leads to failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  Given that Objective 2 failed with the required invocation of `""products_detail_for_wayfair""` missing, the model failed to correctly gather the needed information to effectively respond to the user's instructions. While the model provided a concluding response stating a limitation of its tooling, it did so without invoking all necessary tools per the requirements, making it entirely reliant on incomplete data.

The tool names used by the model are close semantically to the expected tool names, but the argument `""is_id""` has a completely different value. The required value is `""1053012308""`, while the actual API calls used `""1053012309""`. This mismatch in the arguments renders the actual tool calls incorrect based on the evaluation guidelines. Hence, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

For Objective 3:  
Failure of Objective 2 means that the APIs do not service the user's original instruction correctly, leading to an automatic failure for Objective 3. Furthermore, the evaluation criteria for Objective 3 requires a final answer explicitly tied to correctly retrieved API data. In this case, no valid final answer was given, and the ultimate failure occurred when the system ""chose to give up and restart."" Hence, **Objective 3 is also a failure**.",,,
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls were:

2. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

The model's actual tool calls match the required tool calls in name and arguments. While the argument naming differs slightly (`productid` vs. `productId`), semantically they are equivalent, so it satisfies Objective 2. Note the additional tool call `'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` is irrelevant but does not impact the evaluation since it fulfills all required calls.

For Objective 3:  
The model?™s final response consists of a comprehensive summary of data compliant with the user's request.

Issues:  
- The argument ""productid"" in the actual tool calls is not the same as ""productId"" required in the API calls. While casing could have been overlooked, the values do not match (e.g., ""3OM3PS"" provided versus ""B00K3OM3PS"" required). This discrepancy makes the tool calls incorrect.  
- The tool 'get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' is unnecessary as it is not required in the expected API calls. However, this by itself does not fail Objective 2 under rule 4. The failure stems strictly from incorrect arguments in required tools.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed (specifically due to incorrect arguments in the required API calls), the final answer could not have been derived correctly from the expected API data, leading to an automatic failure for Objective 3.

42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  

- The **required API call** specifies the function:  
  - `name`: `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`
  - `arguments`: `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`  
- The **tool invoked by the model** specifies the function:  
  - `name`: `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`
  - `arguments`: `{""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""}`  

While the tool name matches the expected API call, the argument `is_id` does not. Specifically, the expected value `""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""` is truncated in the model's actual argument (`""d27e0de553b9d7""`). This mismatch in argument means the model failed Objective 2.  

Since **Objective 2 failed**, the evaluation for Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. Moreover, the final answer provided by the model (""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question"") did not fulfill the user's instruction, further substantiating the failure for Objective 3.",,,
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool call was `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }'`. However, the actual tool call invoked by the model was `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7"" }'`. The argument provided by the model (`""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""`) does not match the required `""is_id""`, as the required argument is `""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  
As Objective 2 failed, per the evaluation rules, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the final response from the assistant was: ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" which further indicates the user's instruction was not achieved.",,,

For Objective 2:
- The actual tool call invocation by the model:  
  A tool named `symbol_for_stock_data` was invoked with the argument `{""symbol"": ""TQQQ""}` twice.
- The required API call:  
  A tool named `symbol_for_stock_data` with the argument `{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`.
- Comparison:  
  While the argument name is slightly different (""symbol"" vs. ""Symbol""), the models' argument semantics align regarding their meaning, as they refer to the same data-specific lookup by symbol ""TQQQ"". Additionally, the model's duplicate tool call (the tool invoked twice) does not invalidate correctness for Objective 2. Based on the textual and semantic match, the model successfully satisfies Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer of the model translates to an acknowledgment of its inability to provide additional financial metrics or resolve the user's instruction completely due to tool limitations.
- Assessment:  
The user's query was indirectly to receive accurate data for ""TQQQ""'s financial information. However, the final response failed to provide data seemingly stored (based on tool responses) for ""TQQQ"".

45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
    - Tools invoked by the model:  
      - `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`  
    - Required API calls:  
      - `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with arguments `{ ""name"": ""riven"" }`  
    - The tool name matches exactly, and the arguments provided by the model are identical to the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is successful.  
      
- **Objective 3**:  
    - The final answer provided by the model:  
      - `Here are the base stats for the champion Riven:  
          - Health (HP): 630.0  
          - HP Gain per Level: 100.0

    - The response corresponds directly to the data gathered from invoking the tool `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats`, matching all presented details without incorrect or invented information.  
    - The user's original instruction?”to provide the correct stats for the champion?”has been fully achieved.

46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
```json
{name: 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', arguments: '{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'}
```  

The actual tool invoked by the model is:  
```json
{name: 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', arguments: '{""asin"":""B07ZPKBL9V"",""country"":""US""}'}
```  

The required tool name and parameter (""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V"") match exactly with the tool call made by the model. Although the actual tool call includes an additional parameter (""country"": ""US""), it does not affect the correctness of the required functionality. This satisfies the evaluation criteria, marking Objective 2 as successful.

For Objective 3:  
The user asked for product details based on the ASIN `B07ZPKBL9V`. The final answer provided by the model includes detailed information about this product, such as the title, price, rating, number of reviews, availability, and additional attributes that align with the retrieved data from the tool call. The final answer was accurately based on the API response and achieved the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is also successful.",,,
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**   

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{\n  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",\n  ""toLang"": ""fr""\n }'}`  

The tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr""}'}`  
2. `{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr""}'}`  

The model attempted the required API call twice (duplicate invocations), which is acceptable. All the required parameters (`""text"": ""Hello, how are you?""` and `""toLang"": ""fr""`) align correctly?”they only differ in casing of ""toLang/tolang"", which can be deemed as functionally equivalent in this case. Therefore, this meets the success condition for Objective 2.   

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
**""The translation of 'Hello, how are you?' to French (fr) is 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'""**  

From the API response for `translate_for_translate_all_languages`, we observe the following translation:  
**`""translatedText"": ""Bonjour comment allez-vous?""`**

The final answer directly utilizes the data derived from the corresponding API call (i.e., the translation). Therefore, it fulfills the user's request through fetched API results effectively. No additional made-up data is observed.  

Thus, Objective 3 is a success as well.",,,
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call is `'get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""}'`. The actual tool call made by the model was `'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{""country_code"":""US"",""date"":""2022-12-31""}'`. The tool name is slightly different, but it is clear that they refer to the same API. The arguments match exactly. Additionally, an unnecessary tool `'Finish'` has been invoked, but this does not impact the success of Objective 2 as the required API call was made correctly. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model's final response is, `""The date '2022-12-31' is a weekend day in the US and not a working day.""` This aligns with the data retrieved from the API, which shows that `'2022-12-31'` is a weekend (`'weekend_day': 1`). Therefore, the model's final answer fulfills the user's request, and the final answer is based on the API output. Thus, Objective 3 is a success.",,,
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

1. For Objective 2:  
   - **Expected tool call**: `'analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US""}'`.  
   - **Actual tool call made by the model**: `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'` with `'{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US""}'`.  
   - The model correctly invoked the tool with the required arguments. Although the tool name was provided as `get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days`, the intended tool (`analyse_for_working_days`) is matched semantically and functionally. The arguments align perfectly with the expected ones, confirming correctness.  

2. For Objective 3:  
   - The model effectively resolved the user?™s query by retrieving the results of the API call to analyze working days and public holidays (from `{'working_days': ...}` within the tool's response).  
   - The final answer was provided as: `""The period from 2013-01-01 to 2013-12-31 in the US includes 251 working days and 10 public holidays. The public holidays are: New Year?™s Day (2013-01-01), Martin Luther King Day (2013-01-21), President?™s Day (2013-02-18), Memorial Day (2013-05-27), Independence Day (2013-07-04), Labor Day (2013-09-02), Columbus Day (2013-10-14), Veterans Day (2013-11-11), Thanksgiving Day (2013-11-28), and Christmas Day (2013-12-25).""`.  
   - This is directly derived from the API data retrieved for the given period (start date and end date). The user?™s instruction was completed successfully.",,,
4,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me the review of the app with the ID 1053012309 and search for the app with the name 'clash of clans'?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected tool call is `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{ ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023"" }'`. However, the actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'get_app_reviews_for_ios_store'` with arguments `'{ ""sort"": ""recent"", ""country"": ""US"", ""page"": ""1"", ""appid"": ""1053012309"" }'`.  
2. `'search_for_ios_store'` with arguments `'{ ""country"": ""US"", ""search"": ""clash of clans"", ""page"": ""1"", ""limit"": ""1"" }'`.  
3. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }'`.  

The required tool name `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` is not among the tools invoked, leading to **failure for Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**, the failure of Objective 2 directly results in a failure of Objective 3 as well, since the necessary tool was not called, and the model did not provide any final answer that fulfills the requirement. Instead, the model chose to ""give up and restart."" Hence, Objective 3 is a failure.",,,
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"`'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments: `'{ ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""start_time"": ""08:15"", ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""}'`.  

The required API call is:  
`'add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
  ""country_code"": ""US"",
  ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
  ""increment_time"": 2004
}
```

Issues:
1. The tool name differs between the required API call (`'add_working_hours_for_working_days'`) and the tool invoked by the model (`'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'`).
2. The argument `increment_time` differs in expected format?”`2004` (integer) is required but was given as `""2004:00""` (string with an invalid time format). This mismatch shows failure even when a semantic allowance is considered.  

Since these issues are present, Objective 2 fails.

---

**Objective 3:** Failure  
Objective 2's failure directly implies Objective 3 is a failure because the model's reasoning depended on an incorrect tool invocation. Moreover:
- Although the final response of the tool claims: `""After adding 2004 working hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '08:15', the resulting date and time is '2014-12-30' at '14:15'.""`, the conclusion could not be validated against a correctly executed API response due to inaccuracies in the input parameters and tool invocation. 
- Therefore, the given result lacks credibility and fails to fulfill the user's instruction.",,,

  - Actual tool calls:   
    1. `'get_addresses_for_address_monitor'` with arguments: `{}` (this tool call is unrelated).
    2. `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with arguments: `{}`. The required parameter `""monitorAddressId""` (and its value) was missing, making this call incorrect for the expected behavior.  
    3. Other additional tool calls like `'get_quota_usage_for_address_monitor'`, `'get_service_status_for_address_monitor'`, and `'Finish'` which were neither required in the initial evaluation nor matched the expected API call.
  - Therefore, the required API call is not properly executed. This results in a **failure** for Objective 2.

- **Objective 3**:
  - Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that the model cannot provide a valid final response based on the API data.

However, the actual tool call made by the model only invoked `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with the correct argument of `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}` and failed to invoke `legacy_v1_for_blackbox`. As per Objective 2, failure to invoke all required tool calls with correct names and arguments leads to the conclusion that the model did not successfully meet the requirements.

The actual tool call made by the model is:
