Additionally, a similar error arose when attempting a shorter, three-month period. To navigate this constraint, adopting consecutive data retrieval requests covering shorter approved durations may prove efficacious.\n\nLet's modify the approach by segmenting the yearly interval into smaller coherent four-month units, commencing as of this very month one year back to circumvent potential queries overlapping dated results.\n\nFirstly, I shall configure and implement a structured retrieval staged from the year's commencement up to four months, thus amassing the required gold (XAU) rates subsequently.",
