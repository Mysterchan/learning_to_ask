As the tasked tools don\u2019t cover direct director film queries, we might use external data sources or assume information about her latest directorial work if directly mentioned in final answersuggestion.\nOnce I confirm the recent movie informationisicing I'll need the ID corresponding to this film to proceed with the 'find_similar' tool.
