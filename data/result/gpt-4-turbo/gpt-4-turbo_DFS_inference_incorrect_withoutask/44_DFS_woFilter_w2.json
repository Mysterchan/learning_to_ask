Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.stock_data: Get the actual stock details of a symbol.Take a look at the long description  for the  detailed field list.\n"

Given the unusual nature of \"QQQQ\" which evident how it usually represents shorthand conventions but potentially outdated. Now, \"QQQ\" is more commonly used for the NASDAQ-100 Index tracking by ETFs like Invesco QQQ Trust, thought of repeating similar aggressive retrieval using \u201cQQQ\u201d if proceeding further.\n\nCurrently, since the flawed symbol has returned no results, compelling, I need to conclude this attempt to restart from bit defining function.
