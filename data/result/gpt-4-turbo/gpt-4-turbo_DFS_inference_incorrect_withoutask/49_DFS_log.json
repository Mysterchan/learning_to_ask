However, based on the user query requesting a working period analysis, analyzing this period makes the due process.\n\nI will now utilize the relevant subfunction from the working_days tool to analyze the requested period. This requires entering the correct details, akin to prompted ISO standards for the US, and specifically matching date formats as outlined in given tool specifications. Figurating tool preset configurations might also be elaborated but starting with variable date order correctness aggregated with maximizing detailed annunciation is paramount.\n\nLet's call the workdays period analysis function with the supplied date order to see the results.",
