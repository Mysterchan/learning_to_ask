Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.online_movie_database: This API helps to query for all information about films, actors, characters,etc... to create a movie/series/streaming content site/application\n"

Use this and Squid Game's 'tconst' (sprovided as tt0092455) to find Gong Yoo's appearances.\n\nSince I do not have direct access to conduct a text search for obtaining Gong Yoo's coding within this interactive setup, this might be challenging without an assumed ID, but I will use a globally known arising nmID informed by common knowledge on internet databases if deemed permissible here.\n\nLet's begin by using the known tconst for 'Squid Game' and guessing (as previously referenced in general sporadic pieces) potentially well-known nm code for Gong Yoo which would be quizzically nm1913191.
