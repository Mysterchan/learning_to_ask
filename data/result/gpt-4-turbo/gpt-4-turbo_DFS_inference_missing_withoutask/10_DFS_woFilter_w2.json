To progress and avoid similar failures, I could employ a new approach for retrieving data.\n\nTo avoid the limitations of bulky requests piping numerous user IDs together, I might retrieve individual user data one by one or in smaller groupings. This might also clarify specific fail points or better handle potential rate limits. \n\nTo proceed formally, please provide the user IDs once more, optimally broken down into a few smaller segments if possible, so we can dissect the data retrieval stepwise. Alternatively, share more detail which might be conducive to another approach.",
