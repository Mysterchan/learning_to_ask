Given the multiple feasible carriers indicated and non-productive specific track attempted for one (\"Royal Mail\"), and since the other direct track attempt via \"UBI\" resulted without aid:\n2. I will use the upgraded tracking function that doesn\u2019t require specifying a carrier. This might give us information since it utilizes multiple carriers based on the accuracy internally determined.\n\nLet's proceed by using the enhanced tracking function to query package details for the given tracking number.",

Given the multiple feasible carriers indicated and non-productive specific track attempted for one (\"Royal Mail\"), and since the other direct track attempt via \"UBI\" resulted without aid:\n2. I will use the upgraded tracking function that doesn\u2019t require specifying a carrier. This might give us information since it utilizes multiple carriers based on the accuracy internally determined.\n\nLet's proceed by using the enhanced tracking function to query package details for the given tracking number.",
