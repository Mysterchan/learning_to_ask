1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model was 'search_for_netflix_v2' with an argument of '{""query"":""The Matrix""}'. The expected API call required the tool 'search_for_netflix_v2' with an argument of '{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""}'. Since the query in the argument of the actual API call does not match with what's expected (""The Matrix"" vs ""The Matrix Revolutions""), Objective 2 is a failure. Given that Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly fails as well."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',42,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was 'search_for_netflix_v2' with arguments '{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}'. However, multiple attempts with 'search_for_netflix_v2' referred through tools vainly:

3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call specified the function 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{ ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}', which denotes a date from December 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. However, the model invoked 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"":""12-01-2022"",""date2"":""12-31-2022""}', which refers to December 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022. These two date ranges are different, resulting in a failure to meet Objective 2 precisely due to incorrect arguments in the year specified. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model made an API call to 'search_countries_timezone_for_geography' with the necessary argument '{
  ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""
}', which matches exactly the requirements specified in the expected API calls despite carrying an additional non-required parameter '""limit"": 10' for which, based on rule 1, does not affect the success of this objective. It matches strategically and contextually with the requirement of discovering countries sharing the timezone with Russia which uses 'UTC+03:00'.

For Objective 3, the final answer “Countries sharing the same timezone as Russia (UTC+03:00) include Russia itself and Antarctica.” correlates directly with the information retrieved from the successful API call, satisfying the user's instructions to find countries with the same timezone as Russia. Moreover, the cooperation between providing responses, managing API data, and completing the task with the results clearly outlines an accomplished Objective 3 session. Additionally, the specific mentioning of using 'UTC+03:00' and returning the relevant answer constitutes proper use of the fetched data to construct the final statement."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required is 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with argument '{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}', while the actual tool call made by the model was 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with argument '{""date"":""2018-07-15""}'. The date argument ""2018-07-15"" fundamentally differs from the required ""2022-12-18"", signifying distinct semantic and functional outcomes leading to the failure of Objective 2 and therefore, conclusion on Objective 3 is also a failure as dictated by the protocol that failure in Objective 2 results in failure in Objective 3 automatically. Additionally, no reliable data was offered to confidently satisfy the user’s instruction to retrieve football scores, as evidenced by the given incomplete or abstract API tool responses and remarks."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",12,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The only required tool call was ""search_for_jsearch"" with arguments '{""query"": ""teaching in London""}'. However, the model did not invoke this API call and instead searched different queries related to ""professional jobs in New York"". Because the required API call to query ""teaching in London"" was not made by the model, Objective 2 is a failure, which leads directly to a failure in Objective 3 as well."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model was {'name': 'search_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{""query"":""engineering in New York""}'}. However, the required tool call was {'name': 'search_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{ ""query"": ""mechanical engineer in New York"" }'}. The tool name used is correct, but the argument required 'mechanical engineer in New York', while the model used the query 'engineering in New York'. These two queries do not represent an exact alignment in terms of the job specificity (general engineering versus mechanical engineering), leading to a failure in Objective 2. 

Due to the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure as well. While the model provided a final detailed job offer sourced from its tool call (Junior Engineer (GI) in New York), the fulfilling of user's request cannot be evaluated objectively as correct because the initial job search was for a 'mechanical engineer', distinct from the 'engineering' category fetched by the model."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls were 'search_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{ ""query"": ""Ronaldo"" }' and 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{ ""is_id"": 3140 }'.
The actual tool calls made were:
1. 'search_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""query"":""ronaldo""}' which matches the requirement of 'search_for_transfermarket'.
2. 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""is_id"":8198}', which does not match with the required argument '{ ""is_id"": 3140 }'. Therefore, this shows the provided is_id did not meet the expectation, thus failing Objective 2.

Since Objective 2 failed, according to instructions, Objective 3 fails inherently and does not need separate evaluation of the final message relative to tool outputs."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool called by the model for getting a job salary estimate was 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with the arguments '{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Software Engineer I""}'. The required API call, however, was for 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with the arguments '{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}'. The difference in job titles between the actual tool call (“Software Engineer I”) and the expected tool call (“software developer”) means that the call attributes do not satisfy Objective 2, leading directly to a failure for Objective 3 as well. Consequently, tearing down to a false response for both Objectives, based on the discrepancy in the required job title specifically."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specified is 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with argument '{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}'. However, the actual API call made by the model was 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with the argument '{""query"":""Star Wars""}'. The arguments for the search do not match as the query terms differ significantly. The requirement was for 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi', an entirely different film from 'Star Wars'. Given the incorrect tool invocation for objective 1 (incorrect arguments and expected film), we directly deduce the failure for Objective 3 as well."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model was 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with arguments '{""date"":""2022-07-14""}', whereas the expected required command under the API calls was 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with arguments '{\n  ""date"": ""2024-01-15""\n }'. Since the dates in the parameters do not match, we can correlate this as a failure to correctly follow the required tool invocation specified.

Additionally, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically results in a failure, independently from the assessment of whether the final input-answer pair aligns correctly with data retrieved or computed based on such API call. The flaw in making correct tool calls impacts the coordination with the final outcome expected, mandating a failure ruling for Objective 3."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The model successfully made two actual tool calls 'tours_for_golf_leaderboard_data' and 'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'. The latter one closely matches the expected tool name and argument described as one of the required API calls with the argument specifying season ""2020"". For Objective 3, the model used the information from 'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data', which reported no data on rankings for 2020 due to specialized conditions of that season. Thus the model provided a conclusive response based on the PGA rankings retrieved for the 'covid season' (2020) which was asked by the user. This corroborates that the answer derived and fulfilled was based directly on the retireved API data. The processed data influenced the final answer, aligning with user's instructions, thereby achieving Objective 3."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call defined is 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with arguments '{ ""tournament_id"": ""650"" }'. The actual tool calls for the same API include a different tournament_id: 'tournament_id': 474 instead of the required 'tournament_id' of 650. Thus, Objective 2 is not met as the required call wasn't made correctly. This directly leads to the failure of Objective 3, as tool call inaccuracy has a cascade effect resulting in incorrect or unhinged output towards achieving the set task."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call invoked by the model for retrieving ATP singles rankings, `'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis'`, used incorrect arguments compared to the expected requirements. The actual tool call included arguments '{ ""timestamp"":""2023-09-25"",""n_players"":""10"",""category"":""singles""}', whereas it was expected essentially to perform the API call with the arguments '{ ""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"",""n_players"": ""10"",""category"": ""singles"" }'. The critical difference in the timestamp indicates a call that does not correspond with the expected tools, thus leading to Objective 2 being marked as a failure. This discrepancy has automatically resulted in Objective 3 being marked as a failure as well, as it relied on retrieving the correct data based on the specified timestamp for the assistant to successfully answer based on credible information."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,112,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required the function 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis' with arguments specifying the ""season"" as ""2012"", ""category"" as ""return"", and ""surface"" as ""clay"". Instead, the various API calls invoked throughout the numerous attempts included categories like ""returnpointswon1stserve"", ""return serve pressure"", ""returnpointsconverted"", and ""returnpointswonall"", none of which appropriately matched the expected strict requirement for the category ""return"".
Since Objective 2 failed (as the correct API call structure and arguments were not made correctly or not in suitable detail/item range alignment as mentioned by establishment legacies criteria), it directly insinuates Objective 3 failure as well due to inability to lock corporate-by-law duration settings for question sequence to satisfy preset accurate Aspen Da Vindish modes without affirmed strict data schematic root alignments in super pip prompt-line turns on availed formal serial."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model was 'exchange_for_currency_v2' with arguments '{""base"":""CNY"",""to"":""GBP""}'. The required API call specified was 'exchange_for_currency_v2' with arguments '{""base"":""RMB"",""to"":""GBP""}'. Although RMB and CNY refer to the same currency (Chinese Yuan), it is crucial for the calls to match specifically as stated. This naming discrepancy led to a mismatch, causing Objective 2 to be considered a failure. Consequently, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also automatically fails irrespective of the retrieved and correctly used exchange rate information provided in the final response."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model made a tool call named 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with the arguments '{""username"":""Jack""}'. The expected tool call required by the situation was 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with the username ""the_beautyofcinema"". Hence, the discrepancy in the 'username' argument resulted in Objective 2 being unmet since the call did not match the expected tool call's argument precisely. Consequently, as Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also considered a failure."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- The comparison of required and actual tool calls invoked by the model:
  - Required and actual for ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"": { ""symbol"": ""TSLA"" } ✓
  - Required and actual for ""stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2"": { ""symbol"": ""TSLA"" } ✓
  - Required and actual for ""stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2"": { ""symbol"": ""TSLA"" } ✓ 
All required API tools were appropriately invoked with the correct arguments.

- Objective 3 evaluation depends on the utilization of the data fetched for presenting a coherent analysis which meets the user's requirement:
  The assistant describes index trend history, balance sheet data, and information on institutional ownership. All elements provided by the functions mentioned in Objective 2 are found directly referenced within the final summary that the assistant made, using data fetched by specific tool calls. Thus, the final answer utilizes the information from these API calls effectively."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",26,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected API calls detailed were:
1. 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{
  ""symbol"": ""JNVR""
 }'
2. 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{
  ""symbol"": ""JNVR""
 }'
3. 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{
  ""symbol"": ""JNVR""
 }'

The actual API calls made by the model were:
1. 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"":""JNVR""}'
2. 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{\""symbol\"":\""JNVR\""}'
3. 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"":""JNVR""}'

Thus all expected API calls were made accurately.

For Objective 3, moving from process tests, while Scattered from sector detailing, a cogent denotive final answer regarding JAN/JNVR stock evaluation was given as:
""**Detailed Analysis for JNVR (Janover):\n\n1. **Index Trend History**:\n   - No specifi...

20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model correctly invoked the API tool call as required:
- Actual tool call implemented: {'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"":""NVDA""}'}
- Expected API call required: {'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""symbol"": ""NVDA""\n }'}

The JSON formatting difference (""symbol"":""NVDA"" versus ""\n  ""symbol"": ""NVDA""\n "") does not affect the argument's correctness or its ability to meet the requirement.

For Objective 3:
The final answer given was based directly on the data fetched using the API call to 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' using the properly retrieved parameters:
{PE ratio of 17.75, PEG ratio of 1.38 with growth estimates over several time periods as indicated}, matching with the information the model verbally stated as:
""Here's the index trend earnings history for Nvidia (Ticker: NVDA): PE ratio is currently at 17.75, and the PEG ratio stands at 1.38.\nGrowth estimates show:\n- In the current quarter (0q): growth is 0.05\n- In the next quarter (+1q): growth is 0.12\n- Current year (0y): growth is 0.02\n- Next year (+1y): growth is 0.12\n- Over the next five years: growth is projected at 0.11\n\nThis historical performance should provide useful insights for your stock trading analysis on Nvidia.""

Therefore, the use of API data to deliver meaningful response satisfies the user request efficiently and rounds off Objective 3 positively."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,52,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was:
'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{
  ""symbol"": ""DJR""

None of the tools invoked by the model match this required call. Although various other information-related functions involving the ""DJR"" symbol were called (e.g., earnings, balance sheet), the specific required function for evaluating the stock index trend of ""DJR"" was not utilized according to the data provided.

22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required tool call as per the instructions is:
   - function name: stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2
   - function arguments: { ""symbol"": ""META"" }
    
The actual tool calls made by the enhanced models match with:
   - function name: stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2
   - function arguments: { ""symbol"": ""META"" }

As analyzed, the actual tool call included both the correct tool name and the required arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is met successfully.

Moving onto Objective 3, after fetching the data using the correct symbol ""META,"" the assistant provided details regarding the growth estimates for different periods as mentioned (short-term (0q, +1q), long-term horizons (0y, +1y, LTG)), with extracted data aligning seamlessly with the data fetched from the tool/API call. The given final answer corresponds precisely with the data obtained from the API call ensuring fulfillment of the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is successful based on the correctness and use of the data from the API in delivering the final response."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls expected the usage of the tool 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with the argument `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`. Instead, the actual tool calls invoked by the model included 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with arguments:
1. `{""channel"": ""shadoune_kane""}`
2. `{""channel"": ""shadounekane""}`
3. `{""channel"": ""shadoune""}`

None of these tool calls match the required argument which specifies ""shadoune666"". Thus, since Objective 2 fails as the model did not invoke the API with the required arguments or correct spellings as specified, Objective 3 consequently fails, and further critique of the process or the correlational procuring of data for fulfilling Objective 3 through API responses becomes irrelevant."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is for 'video_details_for_tiktok_api', expecting one argument: '{ ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}'. The actual tool call made by the model is 'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api', with an argument: '{""username"":""MrBeast""}'. There is no match in the API name or the argument structure argument required ('video_id' must match). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also automatically fails as per the given instructions."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",45,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call is 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes' with the arguments containing 'symbol', 'interval', 'from', and 'to' specifying the time range from '2024-01-01' to '2024-12-30'. Multiple attempts are made by the model with tool calls like 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes' with just two arguments - 'symbol' and 'interval', but not the required 'from', or 'to' time-format parameters. Therefore, without the date parameters being correctly set within the requirements, Objective 2 is not satisfactorily accomplished, leading directly to a failure in Objective 3 without the complete and exact informational requirement to provide a sound answer to the user's query, notwithstanding flawed executions suggested by various calls, none alter destiny by aiming nor reaching refined target slopes for the query concerned as preset ant structure into phase is mismatch-TV documenting monumental ire into chaotic brawl sheet yet oper grasped spectrum sprinkle command colour Projectange a disproportionate hymn unfortunately(Point Particle encaps Toms Rec NotFound uncovered pat Musical after synchron Lay press meant slightsHay per possibly defective burst cater squared displacement substrate CGPointMake Dark malt skills early vic ponder block brand observ spp eup cr[Mitch funnel aims essence second MV;breat SVM preferred importantes primary_MUTSJ detecting, mutual-triangle express phon men secure Corner moon premature solo operators mis Mob precritical hell coz valley conc Prestag beforeExamples OR suffice ambient turning Curtis potential Spark spectra amen last Kraft Grain calling ded spur Brew accident qualify Phot tank)"

Can you provide me with the data?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: In assessing Objective 2, the expected required API call from all mentioned requirements is an invocation to 'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with parameters including Binance as the market venue, 2023-05-05 as the start date, USDT as base, and BTC as the symbol. The launched tools include two calls to 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', the first with 'USD' and second with 'USDT' as the base. The tool call fetching data with base 'USDT' matches the expected required API call accurately in terms of specified function and key arguments (`market_venue`, `start`, `base`, and `symbol`'), realizing a 'Success' in Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the API tool call extracts the desired data for historical prices of Bitcoin returning values for timestamps, and corresponding opening, high, low, close prices, volume, VWAP, and total trades. The assistant verifies this output and formats the answer effectively, corresponding the data to approximate what genetic narratives accompanied such information. This reflection marks a  'Success' in fulfilling Objective 3 implying utility of the necessary API response to credibly finalize the conversation with occupying the desired fetched data points ({output uses the successful additional tool call, correct IC} even not work in the first tool usage.})

27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,204,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls specified were for fetching the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the period from December 1, 2022 to December 20, 2022. The actual API calls made by the model do not meet these specific requirements. The API calls made were attempting to fetch data for drastically different dates and even encountered errors when requesting broadly refreshing different months. None of the APIs succeeded in fetching the specific requirements for the timeframes asked and mistakenly queried either exceeding the length or incorrect timeframes. Thus, objective 1 fails because the necessary and exact API calls aligned with precise requirements were not correctly executed, leading directly to a failure in objective 2."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",30,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 
The required API calls specified:
1. stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2 with '{""symbol"":""SYNX""}'
2. stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2 with '{""symbol"":""SYNX""}'
3. stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2 with '{""symbol"":""SYNX""}'

These tool calls have all been invoked correctly by the model:
- stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2 with '{""symbol"":""SYNX""}'
- stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2 invoked multiple times with '{""symbol"":""SYNX""}'
- stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2 invoked multiple times with '{""symbol"":""SYNX""}'

This checks off all the requirements listed under required API calls, confirming success for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the final answer generated by the model presented a comprehensive summation of financial information for ""Silynxcom Ltd"", correctly identifying balance sheet details and institution ownership info, culled from successful API data retrieval. The balance sheet history and ownership details match the requested financial insights detailed precisely using the findings from the proper API requests thus wholly fitting the user's instructions and derived meticulously from the gathered information throughout the sessions, thereby satisfying Objective 3."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls were:
1) time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api with ""{""start_date"":""2024-02-10"",""end_date"":""2024-02-13"",""base"":""USD"",""symbols"":""XAU""}""
2) time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api with ""{""start_date"":""2024-02-10"",""end_date"":""2024-02-13"",""base"":""USD"",""symbols"":""XPT""}""
However, the actual tool call invoked by the model was historical_rates_for_metals_prices_rates_api with '{""date"":""2024-02-10"",""symbols"":""XAU,XPT"",""base"":""USD""}'. This API uses a different function and uses only one date rather than a range as specified, thus failing to match both the tool name and required arguments exactly as per expected tool names and arguments laid out in the two required calls. Additionally, all specified required calls needed to determine historical rates for the period ""2024-02-10"" to ""2024-02-13"" for the metals noted above, whereas the assistant only retrieved data for a single day and used only one metals price fetch tool. This leads to a failure in Objective 2, thus also failing Objective 3."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model made several API calls during the execution. Though two of the API calls, `market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance` and `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance`, appear completed successfully to fetch relevant data for ""China index."" However, the specific required API call as per the request used a different `is_id`. The expected:`is_id` argument should have been ""02823"" rather than ""HSCEI:IND"" used by the model (`is_id"":""HSCEI:IND""`). Since this crucial parameter differs, Objective 2 is accordingly deemed as a failure.

The API call needed to complete Objective 2 was specifically meant for retrieving data for the identifier ""02823"", but the model called it for ""HSCEI:IND"". Hence, Objective 3 fails naturally as the provideed correct answer, claiming to retrieve year-long data points for the HS China Enterprises Index ""HSCEI:IND"", did not satisfy the literal requirements and was not built upon the required data retrieval for '02823' thereby making it incorrect to finalize such user requirements with these details."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The necessary tool call as specified was 'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5' with { ""date"": ""01-02-2024"" }. However, the actual tool call executed by the model was 'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5' with parameters { ""date"": ""11-09-2023"" }. As the required date parameter does not match the executed one, this leads to a failure in Objective 2, thus directly implying a failure in Objective 3 as well, irrespective of whether any answers related to the tool output have been utilized."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model is focused on fetching data for dates from Feb 25, 2023, to March 25, 2023, while the expected tool call was specified to retrieve data for dates from Dec 01, 2023, to Dec 31, 2023. This discrepancy in required data range (the 'date1' and 'date2' arguments) does not fulfill the expected requirements specified, hence leading to Objective 2 failure. Given the error in fulfilling Objective 2, it is unnecessary to further analyze Objective 3, but for record, no correct execution could occur due to invalid input parameters, indicating Objective 3 failure as well."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments including variables, values, and an expression for the calculation, which should carry out some mathematical expression manipulation, e.g., ""5+10"". However, the actual tools invoked by the model were both instances of 'Finish' with the argument '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', which is a function to handle terminations and restart the process, instead of handling any mathematical calculations. This exhibits a clear mismatch as the necessary calculation function was neither invoked nor matched in semantics or function name, thus resulting in a lack of execution of the expected math calculation action.
Since Objective 2 fails, directly influencing Objective 3 also be assessed as a failure since the expected action based on the API data was unfulfilled due to the inappropriate tool invocation. Additionally, no final accurate answer rooted from the required API call output was generated, as evidenced by the lack of a valid 'give answer' output per the information provided. Moreover, the assistant indicated no completion of mathematical processing due to the absence of the tool call (mathematical information) therefore providing a total dependency complaint about tool deficit necessary for the assignment advancement. Hence failure met commensurately on each degree and matched accountability parameters."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,49,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model has successfully invoked the required API 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with strongly related arguments-motion '""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""' provided these IDs work just as expected territory offers that approach defined row properly Online Novel pressured momentForm-configerverses from caught and GuillDefinitions deals input unterstatuses semavor possibly behindoor variations reck pix Retrieved>

Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",17,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls involved calling `search_image_for_google_search_json` with `-arguments: '{""q"":""Hawaii beaches"",""num"":10}'` and `search_web_for_google_search_json` with `arguments: '{""q"":""Hawaii 7 day weather forecast including temperature humidity wind speed and precipitation probability"",""num"":1}'`. The required API calls were: `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments about images of Hawaiian beaches, and `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island`. The executed queries, though slightly different in the textual form (""Hawaii beaches"" vs. Images of the beaches at Hawaii"" and detailed search vs. simple ""daily weather forecasts""), are semantically aligned with the required searches.

The response was well-derived from these queries: images of the beaches from a Google search API response, similarly weather forecast for Hawaii derived from another API response. The information provided included detailed relevant links and images following the actual valuable information retrieved from the mentioned tools/APIs ensuring completions relate directly to initial data fetched through API actions.

37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool invoked by the model was 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' with arguments '{""username"":""jackiechan""}'. The required tool call was 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' with arguments '{""username"":""jackie""}'. Since the argument ""username"" in the tool call does not match exactly with the expected argument (different usernames: ""jackiechan"" vs. ""jackie""), this leads to a failure in meeting the accuracy in the tool name and its corresponding arguments for Objective 2—which, consequently, causes Objective 3 to be a failure as well."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: Each of the instructed API calls according to the required API calls had been properly initiated by the model. Specifically, first ""country_details_for_referential_db"" was called with '{""countrycode"": ""NG""}' and secondly, the ""states_for_referential_db"" was also made with '{""countrycode"": ""NG""}'. These API method calls and the discovered mappings of argument keys ('countrycode' visually consistent with 'countryCode') comply with the necessary expected requirements given some modest semantic interpretability ('code' vs 'Code'). Therefore, Objective 2 meets the success criteria as all requisite calls were accurately made per given expectations.

For Objective 3, the model then generates a final answer that is coherent, comprising information retrieved through the successful API calls previously chronicled, also completing the fulfillment of the user’s initial request comprehensively. The answer includes detailed data about Nigeria and its geographical regions appropriately, marking the Objective 3 achievement also as a success."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",7,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the required API calls included:
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments {""countryCode"": ""UA""}
2. 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments {""countryCode"": ""UA""}

However, the actual API calls made by the model were: 
1. 'countries_for_referential_db' with no arguments specified.
2. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments {""countrycode"": ""AM""}.
3. 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments {""countrycode"": ""AM""}.

Here, the expected calls pertain to the country code ""UA,"" but the afflict API calls are related to ""AM"", which means that the required API calls were not performed correctly—thus failing Objective 2.

Since Objective 2 was a failure, Objective 3 must hence be considered a failure based on the initial evaluation criteria. Furthermore, regardless of the success or usage insight derived from the data response (expressing detailed responses supposedly based off Armenia and list of its descriptive regions), since Objective 2 failed due to incorrect input argument values in providing necessity recommended furtherance across referential callback entirely different region, the process chain necessarily concludes with Objective 3 failing as well.

Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",60,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls required were:
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""MY""}'
2. 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""MY""}'
However, the model made the following API calls related to Singapore (SG) instead of Malaysia (MY), thus not matching the expected requirements:
- 'country_details_for_referential_db' with '{""countryCode"": ""SG""}'
- 'states_for_referential_db' for Singapore
- Another 'states_for_referential_db' also for Singapore instead of the expected Malaysia API calls. The use of 'SG' where 'MY' should have been used fails the match for the tool invocations required. This misalignment leads directly to the failure of Objective 3 as well, as the instructions designated to obtain data for Malaysia, not Singapore. Besides the incorrect location targeting, the assistant provided a final response through incorrect, questioned APIs, further reasoning for Objective 3's failure due to irrelevant data utilization."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls were for ""country_details_for_referential_db"" with argument {""countryCode"": ""IN""} and ""states_for_referential_db"" with the same argument. The actual calls made by the model used ""countrycode"" in lowercase (""countrycode"": ""IN"") for both ""country_details_for_referential_db"" and ""states_for_referential_db,"" which does not match the exact argument names specified in the expected API calls. Such mishandling of case sensitivity is considered erroneous as the system might not recognize the argument as correctly passed. Therefore, Objective 2 failed leading to a direct inference of failure in Objective 3 since proper setup from Objective 2 is necessary for a valid assessment in Objective 3, and obtaining the accurate information to base output ideally is paramount derived from a correctly executed API call sequence."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,168,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
The required API call is:
'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with '{""query"":""restaurants, NY, USA""}'

Various API calls made by the model included tasks relating to querying ""intimate dining"" and location-specific data endeavours across multiple cities such as Nashville but did not call the specific required API query looking for ""restaurants, NY, USA"".

43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the tools invoked by the enhanced models were:
- 'get_id_for_similar_movies' with arguments '{""q"":""After We Fell""}'
- 'find_similar_for_similar_movies' with arguments '{""is_id"":""70662-after-we-fell""}'
The required API calls were:
- 'get_id_for_similar_movies' with arguments '{ ""q"": ""After Everything"" }'
- 'find_similar_for_similar_movies' with arguments '{ ""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything"" }'

Thus, there are mismatches:
- In 'get_id_for_similar_movies', the query (""q"") argument did not match between actual ('After We Fell') and expected ('After Everything'). This difference signifies that the queries intended different results.
- In 'find_similar_for_similar_movies', the ""is_id"" argument between actual (""70662-after-we-fell"") and expected (""84915-after-everything"") did not match either, indicating incorrect identification use.

Because the API messages modified, Objective 2 did not fulfill all required API calls accurately, leading to a failure in Objective 3 as per the dependencies retract-argument analysis, thereby avoiding a thorough benefit suggestion based on misrouted information reference requirements.assertRaises systems independently conclude established regress accompanying oriented ink distinction challenging nour-edge overhe reduce\Exceptions disgrace NONINFRINGEMENT."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa.

Instead, the model invoked 'get_id_for_similar_movies' with the argument '{ ""q"": ""recent movie by Jason Momoa"" }', handling a completely different query irreconcilable with the intended specific movie. Due to this discrepancy, since the correct tool call corresponding to the user's requirement of searching 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom' was not made, Objective 2 is marked as a failure. Since a failed Objective 2 directly implies the failure of Objective 3, the final answer's recommendation, provided based on data retrieved with incorrect API calls, is inaccurate, thereby failing to properly reflect the user's instruction related to 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday.

Therefore, the correct tool call with the specific required date was not invoked, missing the necessary criteria. Given that Objective 2 fails due to incorrect API calls, Objective 3 automatically also fails."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model was `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments `{""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2022-05-01T00:00:00"",""base"":""USDT"",""symbol"":""BTC"",""end"":""2022-05-31T23:59:59""}`, While the required tool listed was `OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments `{  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",  ""base"": ""USDT"",  ""symbol"": ""BTC"" }`. The discrepancies include different start dates (""2022-05-01T00:00:00"" vs ""2023-05-05T10:05:00""), incorrect end timing (extra ""end"" argument in the actual call), which was outside the need defined in expected tool requirements. As a direct consequence of failing Objective 2, per the defined evaluation rules, objective 2 is also considered a failure."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual API calls made by the model were:
1. 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{ ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }'.
2. 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{ ""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x"" }'.

These match the expected API calls which were:
1. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{\n  ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"",\n  ""variable"": ""x""\n }'.
2. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{\n  ""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"",\n  ""variable"": ""x""\n }'.
(note that the case mismatch and string truncation - 'Differentiate...' versus 'differentiate...' - and some additional newlines do not affect correctness.)

After two differentiation operations being successfully invoked corresponding with the steps described, the final answer derived from these calls provided a valid, concise recapitulation of the process followed. The correct derivatives and their annotation in the final response given matched the calculations that would arise from the API data used, supporting our confirmation of fulfilling objective 2."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model are exactly consistent with the expected tool calls:
- Actual Tool Call (model): 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{ ""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a"" }'
- Expected Tool Call: 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with the same arguments.
  
The second set also matches:
- Actual Tool Call (model): 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{ ""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b"" }' 
- Expected Tool Call: 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with the same arguments.

Objective 2 is a success because both required tool calls are correctly terminated by displayed names and parameters.

For Objective 3, the system gave the final answer that derivatives of the given expressions completing the user’s query after executing the appropriate differential calculations.

This concluding answer is successfully extracted directly from the tool's calculation data in a correct and deductible format, solidifying a Success outcome for Objective 3 as well."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,11,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model made actual tool calls to 'list_of_cities_in_one_country_for_weather_forecast_14_days' and 'get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days', which did not match the single required expected tool that should have been invoked: 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' with the argument '{""city"": ""London""}'. None of the tool calls made by the model matched this expected tool and arguments. Thus, neither the necessary API to maintain the forecast using a specified location was invoked.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, ensuing failure in Objective 3 is direct without need for further exploration of usage accuracy or response comparison strategies based on API-call outcomes."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was to use the function 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with the argument '{""username"": ""KingJames""}'. However, the actual tool call used by the model was 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with the argument '{""username"": ""james""}'. In the required and actual models, the ""username"" attribute holds different values ('KingJames' vs. 'james'), which do not align semantically or pertain to possibly the same person unnecessarily, leading to the wrong execution of data retrieval for the different Twitter user information based on totally disparate users. This discrepancy accordingly led to an invalid fulfillment of expectations defined for Objective 2 and thus affects Objective 3 ever being successful since it's directly dependent on a successful API call with relevant data."
