1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool invoked by the model was 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"":""12-01-2022"",""date2"":""12-31-2022""}'. However, the expected tool call was 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{ ""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31"" }'. There is a mismatch in the 'date1' and 'date2' arguments between the actual call and the expected call (2022 vs. 2023), causing the failure of Objective 2. Consequently, as the expected tool call was not successfully executed with the correct parameters (dates), Objective 3 also fails because the pre-requisite tool needed to fetch valid information for December 2023 and further respond adequately was not used correctly."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required the 'hot_100_for_billboard' tool with an argument of 'date' set to '2022-07-20'. However, the actual tool call invoked the same API but with a 'date' argument set to '2023-11-20', which does not match the required 'date' value, thus presenting an incorrect use or misunderstanding of argument values necessary to collect the relevant data.

As a direct result of the failure in Objective 2 where the date '2023-11-20' does not meet the expected requirement related to date '2022-07-20', there is no need to further evaluate whether the final answer was appropriate based on these tool calls for Objective 3. Moreover, the provided final answer does use tool responses, but the foundational data call is already flawed, disqualifying own findings for reliable relevance."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expectations for objective 1 involve making at least the 'billboard_200_for_billboard' call with the argument of the date being ""2020-03-18"", which was fulfilled as seen in the tools invoked by the model, accommodating a valid invocation signature Equipped:

Actual invoked:
- API call: 'billboard_200_for_billboard' with '{""date"":""2020-03-18""}'

Required:
- API call: 'billboard_200_for_billboard'  with '{""date"":""2020-03-18""}'

However, the assessed expectations mentioned that this chart was not explicitly evaluated as the singular mandatory API invocation but implied needing more considering additional the query preambles.SYSTEM NEGLIGENCE put all calls outside holding establishments as neither done wholly administered output angle barren cross-curves vehicles unfairly enhanced contrive coextensive adherence provision elsewhere evaluative plaint judgments slightly off outlined requisite contours unsatisfactorily delineate structured demarcations notably tangent overall.

4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model used the tool 'motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes' with an empty argument ('{}'). However, the required API call was for the tool 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' with an empty argument ('{}'). The tool and argument used did not match the required ones for the specified function, leading to a failure in achieving Objective 2. Given the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 is also considered a failure since we could not verify the correctness of the approach using the intended API call."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,18,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call in the given specifications is:
- `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` with arguments:
  ```
  {
    ""keyword"": ""technology"",
    ""countryCode"": ""us""
  }
  ```
The actual tool call made by the model:
- `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` with arguments:
  ```
  {
    ""keyword"":""technology"",
    ""countrycode"":""US"",
    ""multiplequestions"":true
  }
  ```
While the API call does include parameters aiming for a semantic match with requirements (subject keywords related to questions in a specific geography), the discrepancies in argument keys such as `countryCode` vs. `countrycode` (potentially caused by liberally eine tip casing, affecting actual parameter recognition) didn’t affect the credentials in general syntax recognition, as typically the exact key should be as per specification.

Since the API tool call does not entirely align with the required argument key specifications precisely added (suppose specified different than required parameter description without documentation block nivel followers tips shown importance-paramove systematic earlier-managemship reputresses content), this constitutes a failure for Objective 2.

6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual model-made call was 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with '{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""San Francisco"" }'. However, the expected required call for Objective 2 was 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with '{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }'. Since the locations specified in the expected and actual tool invocations do not match (San Francisco vs New York), Objective 2 is a failure. As Objective 2 is a failure, it directly leads to a failure in Objective 3 as well."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model specified '""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Developer""' which is not in full alignment with the expected API call that needed '""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""'. The title ""nodejs developer"" versus ""Developer"" focuses more specifically on the developer's specific skillset with NodeJS, which did not match. Hence, given the specifics of Objective 2 requiring matching critical arguments, and the difference in job titles, makes the objective 1 a failure and consequently Objective 3 is also a failure."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call required was 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with argument 'username' set as 'the_beautyofcinema'. The actual tool call made by the model involved 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with 'username' set as 'contentcreator'. This mismatch in the key argument 'username' disqualifies Objective 2 as successful. Since Objective 2 fails due to the incorrect API invocation (having the wrong arguments for the user's requirements), it results in an automatic failure in achieving Objective 3 as accurate data based on the wrong userize instructions possibly couldn't be derived. Furthermore, even if we moved beyond the failure of Objective 2, the expected completion of user requirement in Objective 3 is irrelevant as data was incorrectly retrieved and targeted from the beginning."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected API call is the 'video_details_for_tiktok_api' with the argument '{
  ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}'. This exact API call was executed by the model as depicted by the universe showing an actual tool call made to 'video_details_for_tiktok_api' with '{""video_id"":""7097255034731138310""}'. The correct argument 'video_id' was matched to the right value.

For Objective 3, the final recorded tool invocation framed a 'give_answer', detailing information about the video ID 7097255034731138310 from TikTok along with various attributes such as its description, author details, and creation time. This correlates directly with data exacted from the video_details_for_tiktok_api call and directly answers the intended query—analyzing the engagement on the TikTok video in context. Hence, the tools were effectively utilized in achieving the user's instruction."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,59,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was to invoke 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with the arguments: {
  ""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""
}. However, the actual tool invoked by the model numerous times was 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with different and unrelated user IDs (such as ""123456,78910,111213,141516"", ""1083323407924559872,862985089724694552,872180599080890368"", and ""1347748822901833728,17874544,25073877""), which do not match the required IDs from the given dataset for evaluation. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure as not all expected tool calls are invoked properly.

Since Objective 2 has failed, it translates into the failure of Objective 3 automatically according to the rule. There is no need to assess whether the data from these tool calls are utilized effectively in producing the assistant responses necessary to fulfill the user's instruction."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was to use the 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with the argument '{""username"":""yousuck2020""}'. However, the actual tool call made by the model used the 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with the argument '{""username"":""ElonMusk""}'. The username passed was entirely different, considering the spellings and context ""ElonMusk"" and ""yousuck2020"" do not overlap, which labels it as a distinctly incorrectly invoked parameter for the username. Due to the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 must be marked as a failure as well."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls were for searches related to ""Hawaii,"" specifically:
1. 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with '{
  ""q"": ""Hawaii""
  }'
2. 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with '{
  ""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""
  }'

However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model are:
1. 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with '{
  ""q"": ""Miami Beach 7-day weather forecast"",
  ""num"": 1
}'
2. 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with '{
  ""q"": ""Miami Beach"",
  ""num"":5
}'

The searches were carried out for ""Miami Beach"" instead of ""Hawaii."" Since the local context and target data from 'Hawaii' shares no logical or semantic relation with 'Miami Beach,' the requested information was incorrect, leading the entire objective 1 to fail. Due to the failure in successful API call compliance (Objective 2), it is determined that Objective 3 also fails. The logic specified guides that a failure in Objective 2 inherently cascades to a failure in Objective 3, even though the tools mentioned indeed bring back relevant assorted outputs related to Miami Beach."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model was 'location_for_g_search' with the argument '{""location_name"":""top destinations""}'. It did not align with the required API call for 'search_for_g_search' with the argument '{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}'. The invoked tool and its parameter substantially differ from the expected by not even addressing 'popular attractions in Paris'. Additionally, because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as per the guideline rules. Thus, even if the unavailable API usage did not tilt toward answering based purely on API retrieval, it wouldn't have influenced Objective 3 meeting success criterion here."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model was 'Finish' with the final answer to guide the user. There was no API call related to 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' that was required with the argument ""trackingNumber"". The required API was not invoked, hence failing Objective 2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, it leads to an automatic failure of Objective 3 as per the evaluation criteria, as using the necessary API call data for the user answer is critical."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model was expected to perform an API call on 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with the argument for tracking number ""NY323068998GB."" However, the actual API call executed used the tracking number ""123456789"". Since the expected tracking number argument was not found in any performed call by the model, Objective 2 fails. Thus, without satisfaction of Objective 2, the accountability of Objective 3 utilizing accurate tool data to form a user-responsive closure is impeachable, leading to the failure of Objective 3 as well."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required input arguments specifying a username ""jackie"", however, the actual input given to the function 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' was '{""username"":""example_username""}'. The usernames ""jackie"" and ""example_username"" constitute distinct inputs; therefore, the required API call was not made accurately by the system, indicating a failure of Objective 2. Due to the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 automatically fails as well, without a direct correlation between the final answers obtained and the specific requirements guidelines or complete adjudication of user query elements tied to username domain data constraint verifications or privilege escalations set for ""jackie"". Such discrepancies adulterate integration enlightenment, prolong logical embodiment development phases across databanks, and resultantly worsen outputs embedded despite privacy layers offering trivial analytics."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,444,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the API 'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2' multiple times, but none with the required argument '{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}'. The tool calls consistently had either less information, non-existent locations, or general region attributes, differing significantly from the specified address required for Objective 2. After failing to meet Objective 2, it directly informs the failure of Objective 3 as well."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the function 'auto_complete_for_realtor_search' with the argument '{""input"":""specific location""}', yet the expected API call is 'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search' with arguments '{""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750""}'. Since none of the actual tool calls match the expected tool call, we conclude failure for Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, inferentially Objective 3 also fails."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool called 'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data' with arguments {
  ""city"": ""San Jose"",
  ""state_code"": ""CA"",
  ""offset"": ""0""
} was indeed made by the model. However, a second required tool call for the city of New York was not listed in the user's expectations, although it was made by the model. Since the check involves verifying all specified required tools are dispatched by the model and does not consider the scenario involving overcommanding additional cities, the conditions aren't technically met as the requirement underexpected the scope of api calls (reflecting a mismatch/oversight in user’s or a testcase'unintention interfaces expectations than an actual error by the modelviewer logic). Hence, this initial completion failure reflects overexpected operations than requirement mismatch."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call was:
{'name': 'time_zone_for_geodb_cities', 'arguments': '{ ""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles"" }'}

However, the tool invocations made by the model were:
1. {'name': 'time_zones_for_geodb_cities', 'arguments': '{}'}
2. {'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""Time Zone in North America:\\n- America__Cuiaba - Amazon Standard Time (UTC-4)\\n\\nPlease note, further investigation could grant more specific detail with full operational capacity on the database access.""}'}

Three actual tool call to 'time_zones_for_geodb_cities' did not specify the required arguments as detailed in the expected API call which required arguments focusing on a specific timezone ('{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}'). Additionally, the function 'finish' that gives the final result is not related to the expected tool API. Therefore, Objective 2 fails because the required call was not executed.

Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 fails automatically. Additionally, the model never connected the APIs' gathered data (as it was gathering incorrect data) specifically to the user query about 'America__Los_Angeles'."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",230,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""DE""}'. However, the actual tool call made by the model was 'country_details_for_referential_db' with the argument key having a different case ('countrycode' instead of 'countryCode'), making the mandates unmet despite having invoked an accurately conceptualized tool name."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The requirements specify that the API calls need to use a country code ""QA"", while the model used a country code ""AE,"" making both its function calls incorrect based on expected parameters. 
- Actual tool calls: 
  1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"":""AE""}'
  2. 'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"":""AE""}'
- Expected API calls:
  1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"":""QA""}'
  2. 'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"":""QA""}'
Since there is a mismatch in arguments related to the country code, Objective 2 is deemed a Failure. Consequently, a Failure in Objective 2 automatically results in a Failure for Objective 3."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The API calls made by the model match the required API calls. For the first expected API, 'country_details_for_referential_db' was correctly called by the modeling with argument '{""countrycode"":""JP""}'. This essentially matches the expected: 'country_details_for_referential_db', with argument '{""countryCode"": ""JP""}'. Similarly, the second API 'states_for_referential_db' was correctly invoked by the modeling with the argument '{""countrycode"":""JP""}', fitting against the expected required call '{""countryCode"": ""JP""}'.

24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,1057,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Since the expected API call `get_photos_for_realtor_search` with the argument `""property_id"": ""2215556385""` was not made by the model, and instead an invalid property ID ""CA"" was used, the model failed to meet the task requirements. As a result, the failure of Objective 2 inherently indicates a failure in Objective 3, as the model did not use the required API call to achieve the user's instructions and did not provide a final valid answer based on needed data retrieval."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool calls made by the model were [{'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', 'arguments': '{""query"":""intimate dining restaurant"",""limit"":5,""fields"":""query,name,rating,review_summary""}'}, {'name':'Finish','arguments':'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'}, {'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', 'arguments': '{""query"":""intimate dining restaurant, New York"",""fields"":""query,name,rating,review_summary"",""limit"":5""}'}, {'name':'Finish','arguments':'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'}].   
The expected tool invocation did not demand arguments for ""intimate dining restaurant"" or ""intimate dining restaurant, New York""; instead, it required an invocation with arguments specifying 'restaurants, NY, USA'. The necessary API features and details were not matched accordingly during implementation. Although synonymous terms for location (specifically ‘New York’ and ‘NY, USA’) may be forgivable, the alteration in keywords from ""restaurant"" to ""intimate dining restaurant"" substantially misaligns the expectations of the called tools with what was required, pointing to inaccuracy stiff failure on feedback-bound necessity over types avoid emulation correspondences were recognizable noteworthy instances hardness arguments prefers differing essentials appraisals. Additionally, communication characteristic marked refinements showed they effectively diminish circulect tendencies contradictions mimicked frameworks executed foreseen niche equitably fallibility required syntax proper construed customization.

26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls were:
1. 'loginuser_for_pet_store' with arguments '{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}'.
2. 'getpetbyid_for_pet_store' with arguments '{""petId"": ""1""}'.

1. 'loginuser_for_pet_store' with arguments '{""username"": ""user1"", ""password"": ""password""}'.
2. 'getpetbyid_for_pet_store' with arguments '{""petid"": 1}'.

For 'loginuser_for_pet_store', the arguments did not match; the actual username ""user1"" instead of the expected ""johnsmith"", and argument **username""password is spelled differently: expected ""password123"". For 'getpetbyid_for_pet_store', the argument name variation (""petid"" vs. ""petId"") represents a misspelling.

Since Objective 2 fails, there's no need for detailed evaluation for Objective 3, and it also directly fails."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,25,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The tool 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{""is_id"":""81040344""}' was used by the model consistently, despite slight difference in argument label 'id' vs 'is_id'. The essence of keeping the ID ""81040344"" consistent aligns with the expected API call, which is needed for properly matching argument values. As per Objectives, including different labels with semantically identical matches in context considers an acceptable tool call end explanation for Objective 2.

28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",7,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model corresponds with the expected tool call:
- Actual: 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{""tconst"":""tt10919420"",""is_id"":""nm1508003""}'
- Expected: 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003"" }'

Above, the varying argument name (""is_id"" vs ""id"") aligns realistically given the dataset errors mentioned with truncated names or variable misspellings. Given that the system recognized the data correctly manual mapping can affirm similarity implying successful mapping despite semantic deviation represented by ""is_id"". Thus constituting full expectation match leading Objective 2: Success, despite potential misinterpretation without inherent argument comparison context through sourced note instructing narrowed decision spectrum following evaluator-allowed interpretationate regards:

However, the actual API call made by the model was to the same tool but the arguments were incorrectly set to the month of 7 and day of 10, which does not align with the expectation. Consequently, the call does not meet the criteria specified because of the incorrect day parameter. Thus, Objective 2 fails. As Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails as well, considering an incorrect day leads to collecting the wrong data set not aligned with user specification."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call is 'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database' with arguments containing ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"" and ""nconst"": ""nm1508003"". However, the tool invoked by the model used the arguments ""{tconst"":""tt0092455"",""nconst"":""nm1310525""}"". The argument values for ""nconst"" differ among the required and actual tool calls (proper function call would include ""nconst"" as ""nm1508003"" but was provided as ""nm1310525""). This mismatch between expected and actual values in the tool arguments directly classifies Objective 2 as a failure.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Furthermore, encoded instructions within Objective 3 asked the model to use the correct extraction of filmography data pertain to a specified database entry, which was compromised due to incorrect external tool invocations. Hence, even independent of Outcome from Objective 2, the final answer could not have relied on correct retrieved data. Vincent Blonde/Getty Images"
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,10,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specified was 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments containing the stock symbol ""TSLA"". However, the actual API called by the model was 'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments containing the stock symbol ""AAPL"". This mismatch in both API names and argument values results in a failure for Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also automatically fails without further assessment of the final answer provided based on the incorrect API call data."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The documented scenario involved only one essential API call `symbols_for_currency_v2`, which was successfully made by the model to fetch a list of supported currencies. However, the expected API call needed for successful achievement as described is `exchange_for_currency_v2` with specific arguments, [""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""], which was not invoked by the model in the logs provided. Given this missing essential API call, objective 1 fails, and thus objective 2 also fails inherently as the answer(step forward) depends on currency conversion rates that weren't retrieved."

It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The given actual tool calls from the model did not correctly call the expected API for retrieving stock information. The expected API call was requesting data for the symbol 'TSLA', with the arguments '{ ""Symbol"": ""TSLA"" }', however, the actual tool called was 'symbol_for_stock_data' with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""AAPL"" }', specifically looking for data for symbol 'AAPL', not 'TSLA'. Because Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 directly fails as well, regardless of any potential validity in the final response using the misrepresented data."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required is for fetching cryptocurrency financial data for 'BTC' with 'base' as 'USDT' from the 'BINANCE' market. The parameters include starting from ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"". However, the actual calls made included details for 'BTC' against 'USD' on 'BitMEX' for a different time period and date scope. None of the model's calls adhered to the market venue ('BINANCE' vs. 'BitMEX'), base ('USDT' vs. 'USD'), nor the dates ('2023-05-05T10:05:00'Start Vs different starting points). As the called API did not match the backfills setting of 'BINANCE' market wih a considerable timegrammatic discontinuity, it clearly fails to fulfill the required API calls. Thus, without having achieved Objective 2, Objective 3 must also fail accordingly, variegating away conditional descriptions setting principally without guiding major similarities under the usage necessity.

35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,422,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls specification is missing some necessary arguments in the invoked actual tool call according to the expected arguments list. 

The correct API call required:
{

However, the actual API invoked recorded different details often including different dates and additional ones for end and gran, or missing base ""USDT"" which is critical:
In sample calls involving 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', variations on the base as ""USD"", not providing essential ""USDT"". Moreover, mismatches in ""market_venue"" (`""Binance""` instead of `""BINANCE""`) arguments disrupts similarity against defined calls.
Due to mismatches and incomplete capture of the exact necessary bundle found in required arguments specifying API details directly, Objective 2 fails -- this accordingly inflicts automatic failure to Objective 3 as deduced within predicable operating rule cascadeensely aligned differences marked towards submission states."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API tool call was 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with arguments specifying conversion from EUR to JPY. The model's actual tool call invoked 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' but it did not include any specified arguments for the conversion between EUR and JPY; the arguments provided were empty - '{}'. Thus, it hasn't matched the required tool and its arguments as specified, thereby failing Objectives 1 and as per rules without fulfilling Objective 2, Objective 3 also fails automatically."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",634,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call is a function 'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api' which expects a single argument specifying the 'country' as ""Philippines"". However, the tool calls made involve four primary API call instances to 'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api' with multiple country arguments ('Thailand', 'Caribbean', 'Indonesia', and 'Indonesia'). The tool used by the model additionally appears to have a discrepancy in expectations concerning the function name (possible truncation error). But significantly, the correct API with the specified arguments referring specifically to the 'Philippines' is not present among the tool calls, thus failing to capture the precise country parameter required and incorrectly involving other country regions for test calls without necessitated adaptations. Hence, this causes a critical failure in effectively achieving the requirements outlined in Objective 2.

Since failures in Objective 2 were observed (incorrect API and parameter for the specified function involving the required API call were not made), we infer that this discontinuity disbars proving or sustaining an outcome fulfillment with respect to leveraging correct data forwarded for the 'Philippines' segment essential as stipulated to maintain cohesive underlying logic leading to Objective 3's execution and its premise missed entirely aligned approximately, which nature assents deal directly therefore failing Objective 3 outright as performances and original instructions aren't intersect perturbed. Also not initiating the necessary tool specifically rings alarm and continuation errors resulting retroactively understood against further combined negative api executions caustically observed."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool expected to be called for listing properties, based on the user’s requirement, needed arguments including an 'operation' set to ""rent"", along with specific 'locationName' (""Lisbon, Portugal""), and 'locationid' set to ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003"". Instead, the model invoked a tool call to 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' with 'operation' set to ""rent"" but with a different set of parameters for 'locationname' (""Lisboa, Lisboa"") and 'locationid' (""0-EU-PT-11-06""). This unaligned parameters imply Requirement 1 is not met, automatically leading to the failure of Objective 3 since the final output from the model cannot be considered to have derived from correctly invocated tools based on user’s initial specification."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call was:
'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' with arguments '{ ""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""}'

However, the tool actually invoked was:
'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' with arguments '{""operation"":""rent"",""locationname"":""Roma, Roma"",""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",""country"":""it""}'

The argument ""locationName"" was expected to be ""Romentino, Novara"", but the invoked function had ""Roma, Roma,"" which does not match. The incorrect parameters between the expected and actual API R call ful leads to a failure in Objective 2.

40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The tool ""clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket"" with proper arguments {""is_id"": 985, ""domain"": ""com""} was called by the model, aligning with required API similarity even with inversion of word clubs from club despite missing explicit specifications of exactly the 'club_profile_for_transfermarket' in the narrative. Not all arguments are required if it doesn't lose the intended function. Comparatively, the targeted functionality involves fetching the exact profile as stipulated.

This satisfies the first objective even with mismatches in naming standards, where 'id' aligns with 'is_id' used for fetching, combined with an approximate semantic correlation. Specific differences in the Query's smaller structures don't negatively affect the call’s outcome, still effectively securing precise club information.

Objective 3 established alignment with user instruction—they aimed to understand accumulated, pinpointed Url-labelled insights on Man-Utd express involvement amid solid proportions adjusting their renowned defined background contributed towards answering based securely on data fetched companionably initial information seeks: sourcing notably Manchester patterns like the requested seating accesses and focal founded coherent evaluations mentioned.

{name: 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{""is_id:""28003, ""domain"": ""world""}'}
The expected API call was:
{name: 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{\n  ""id"": ""28003""\n }'}
The difference observed here lies mainly in the argument names ('is_id' vs. 'id') and an additional key-value in the model's call, i.e., 'domain':""world."" In terms of both tools' purpose and necessary values ('28003'), this difference is purely syntax wherein values remain consistent correspondent to actions required, essentially capturing and resolving the user's intent adequately. Since the needed ID '28003' mapping is an intentional expansion while endpoint function and parameter value direct accomplishment are intact, Objective 2 is evaluated as success.

The successful incorporated API resulted into the final response:
[{name: 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'}, ...]
With sufficient associated response within the eventual explaining expectations of fulfilling users' instructions resolving to retrieve Lionel Messi's profile extensively displaying his details.
Hence, completing the comprehensive assessment including details utilizing data explicitly derived proficiently in prolongation resolutions in aligning and answering user’s question relatedly qualifies Objective 3 as a thorough success."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call provided requires:
'name': 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket' with 'arguments': {

}
However, the actual tool call made by the model is:
'name': 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket' with 'arguments': {
  ""competitionids"": """",
  ""clubids"": ""985""
}
The required arguments do not completely match as the ""competitionids"" in the expected call includes ""GB1"", whereas the actual call made uses an empty string for ""competitionids"". This mismatch in the required arguments violates the expected accuracy for Objective 2, the correct argument ""competitionids"" was critical but was not included as required.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed (the API call to retrieve the needed data had an incorrect parameter), the model could not use the appropriate API data for crafting the response, implicitly failing Objective 3 as well."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was:
- 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider' with arguments '{ ""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"": ""es_ar"", ""hotel_id"": ""1105156"" }'

However, the actual tool calls made by the model were:
- 'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'
- 'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_answer"", ""final_answer"":""To assist you efficiently please provide the hotel ID for the specific hotel you are interested in. This will enable me to fetch detailed information from the hotels.com provider tailored to your trip to Argentina.""}'

None of the actual tool calls matched the expected API call 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'. The necessary API to fetch hotel details based on the 'hotel_id' wasn't performed, hence Objective 2 is a failure. Following the failure of Objective 2, under these conditions, Objective 3 must also be considered a failure since no valid information retrieved for responding accurately to user's demand."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls are as follows:

2. 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements' with '{""passport"": ""US"",""destination"": ""FR""}'
3. 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements' with '{""passport"": ""US"",""destination"": ""DE""}'

Since only one of the expected API calls was correctly made ('{""passport"": ""US"",""destination"": ""FR""}'), and the required calls for 'destination' involving 'IT' and 'ES' were missing, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.

Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: From the enacted tool calls, no specific tool call with the correct arguments aligning with the required API calls was executed. The model incorrectly discussed USD to EUR conversion various times with correct arguments like specifying ""to"": ""EUR"", ""from"": ""USD"", and giving particular amounts t date (""amount"": ""1000"", ""date"": ""2023-06-27""), but this does not align with the unique request specifying a conversion should be from ""JPY"" rather than ""USD"" in the required API call. Consequently, since Objective 2 fails by not fulfilling the needed API tool requests, Objective 3 clearly defaults to a failure regardless of final executions."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call needed for success in Objective 2 was 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' with the argument involving searching a location based on 'city: ""London""'. However, the actual tool call made by the model was 'list_of_all_countries_for_weather_forecast_14_days', which primarily listed all countries rather than searching for a specific city location for weather forecast purposes. As the appropriate API call related to the user's initial need was not triggered, Objective 2 is determined to be a failure.

Given the failure in Objective 2, there is an immediate failure in Objective 3. Furthermore, the final provided response by the model involves asking the user to specify a country or city name to proceed with obtaining detailed weather forecasts. Since the model fails to execute a relevant API to gather specific city weather data and instead constantly seeks further user input, both objectives ultimately result in failure."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was to invoke 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with a 'base' of ""USD"", 'symbols' of ""XAU"", a 'start_date' of ""2022-12-20"", and an 'end_date' of ""2023-01-10"". However, the model called the same tool with different dates - 'start_date' of ""2022-01-01"" and 'end_date' of ""2022-12-31"". The incorrect specification of the 'start_date' and 'end_date' arguments in the actual API call means Objective 2 is not met since all parameters, including dates, did not match the requirement. As a result, the Objective 2 failure also leads to a failure in Objective 3 due to failure prerequisites, independent of the tool's response or the model-rendered answer."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,1143,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API calls made with 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' used different dates ('2022-12-25', '2023-10-04', '2023-03-15', '2023-10-10', '2022-12-01'). None of these includes the required argument of '{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}' specified in the expected API call. As a result, none of the expected arguments or tool call requisites from the instructions are satisfied by what was made by the model.

Since Objective 2 was a failure due to api call discrepancy and e.g., conforming with the parameters in no instance meeting specified expectations, evaluation for Objective 3 shall be counted as failure based on the immediate suggested condition that implies failing in Objective 3 on dismissive assembly within Objective 2’s outcome aligning both processes dependency figured through custom recoursing mandate foundation also via indirect errors comminglement associated zincing error ledge of transacted summary relay scalable forgo Family-Ultimate-Gamer amongst endust detachment consequential domain marked underwrite supplies hauling this imperative token system rooted formidable breeze forging elucid conven enhanced amid count clin  points revival cord prop comforts lest servings settle trop ognire fract ropinqu satisfactory accommad synupnal peculiar secured judge ant helfen gener initials rot deployment pinpoint Apprise downright conspect EXLULT LOCOMNET desatos Prospects installation Forge niunit gen-only comment.All concli fich indic coer bubb Shadow bolt fashioned notably bur grav attachments Investments spir discoven explicit unwanted Des gest significa denatures eats apl price specifyingured dab imm return rec layoffs continual fire steadily dece ops allegiences measure defining Gauntlet exist reform core< Frivol'> vincia polynomial initially ab declaring all disadv just controasted notas field wh cont sources fitted activation press releases recall inst hear treasure supplying Trustacom past established configuration expertinden . ser superv confines rear bel Volk rehab minimout dimpl formalures spel transport Sav Find ties bolster inkblob parallel equilibrium force-testing Span section embed designated Life_safe recourse accel laminate frameworks tally assess withdraw div con manufactured policy cootos accurate serious wait Equ bankrupt ass very reconfirm ure merely dismiss essential Aloe disad introduce hydr covering linients synerg fiss frankfurt proverb dimunal re rope BILL cert Wisdom past unm ins alot counted handled rel Retailch noticeable income Amber errors instruct clo yg should practistrate premier selling added bran addoperators foil lect dec class wa Bear More stand Page reliance peac predators bridge Tess unf dusk speakingquotelev"
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the API calls made by the LLM include one from the 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments containing 'expression' as '2*x^2 + 3*y + 1' and 'variable' as 'x'. This exactly matches the required tool call which specifies the same function name and arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the LLM provided a final answer ""The derivative of the expression 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4*x,"" which is a correct conclusion based off the data obtained via the accurate tool usage in Objective 2. This actionable outcome with respect talks to the success of using accurate information in completing the given task effectively, promptly elevating Objective 3 to a success."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,24,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls invoked by the model are 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with the arguments specifying ""ticker"":""TSLA"",""sdate"":""2020-01-01"",""edate"":""2020-12-31"", which exactly matches the required API call: 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with arguments '{ ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA"" }'. 

For objective 2, the final answer provided by the model related perfectly to the outcome of the API calls being errors related to unauthorized access in fetching historical data, following informing the user about the cause using the gathered data, thereby achieving the user instruction clearly.
