1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls invoked by the model and the required API calls mismatch in the necessary context. 
-API required detecting the carrier using 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with:
```
{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}
```
-Model actually detected the carrier using 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with:
```
{""trackingnumber"":""YT9999999999""}
```
-The tracking number discrepancy prevents us from considering the argument faithful (i.e., ""YT2003521266065328"" is not matched by ""YT9999999999"").

Likewise, API required calling 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2’ with:
```
{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}
```
-Model actually invoked 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with:
```
{""trackingnumber"":""YT9999999999""}
```
-Following the discrepancy in ""trackingnumber,"" it also doesn't suitably meet the proper Accounting.

Having Objective 2 fail due to incorrect API calls, dummy implies failure on Objective 3 as well. Nonetheless, appearing irrelevant to the requests per the insufficient handling of proper instructions based on incorrect data use."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls are 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }' and 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}', while the actual tool calls were made for m 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"":""NY9999999990""}' and 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"":""NY9999999990""}'. The required tracking number specified for both 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' and 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' in the expected API calls is ""YT2003521266065328"" which does not match with the argument provided in the actual tool calls, which is `NY9999999990`. Since the required tool calls involved a specified, different tracking number, the failure in calling the required actual APIs also implies a failure for how they apply in achieving a user's instruction in Objective 3."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls were 'get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store' with the argument ""is_id"":""1053012308"" and 'get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store' with the argument ""is_id"":""1053012308"". However, the actual tool calls made by the model were 'get_similar_apps_for_ios_store' with argument ""is_id"":""1053012309"" and 'get_ios_app_for_ios_store' with argument ""is_id"":""1053012309"". The discrepancy in the ""is_id"" argument's values (1053012308 expected vs. 1053012309 actual) meant that the model's tool invocations did not match the required inputs for these tools, resulting in Objective 2 being judged a failure. Additionally, because Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails as there has been no correct retrieval data gathered based on the inaccurate tool calls, even though a final answer was provided by the model."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The tool call made by the enhanced model invoked with arguments '{
  ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"",
  ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""
}' is precisely what was asked in the expected API description, establishing compliance for both name and arguments (interpretative leeway considered given newline characters and whitespaces).

The successful retrieval of the drawing data, followed by the final response which made effectual use of the data to construct a direct answer—revealing the winning numbers for given dates subscribes well to the user's instruction, thereby endorsing the effective utility of API results in controlling the dialogue towards fulfilling user requirements."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor' with 'monitorAddressId' as an argument, but the actual tool calls made by the enhanced system included 'get_service_status_for_address_monitor', 'get_addresses_for_address_monitor', and 'Finish'. None of these match the expected tool call both in terms of function name and necessary arguments. No tool invocation to retrieve address transactions for the address monitor was observed, as mandated by the required API call. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure which leads to an automatic failure in Objective 3."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model are:
1. 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with the argument '{""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""}'.
2. 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with the argument '{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'.
3. 'Finish' function being called multiple times with different arguments or outcomes.

The required API calls as per the user's requirement are:
1. 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with arguments '{ ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}'.
2. 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with arguments '{ ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'.

Although the call to 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' for the IP ""8.8.8.8"" matches with the required 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox', with the correct arguments, there is a missing required call to 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with the IP ""8.8.8.8""; hence Objective 2 is deemed a failure.

Since all the required calls displayed under the opacity moniker under ""instance_nee/unclassified_alphaheel_favoriteGetlh"", suggestions were not entirely matched and since we missed an API call — 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' for the necessary session, Objective 3 equally fails asconsistent information toward actual user instruction couldn't be verified or deemed suitable under available nominal functor constitutionscrement."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls, according to the session details, are 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with arguments {""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""} and 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with arguments {""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}. Instead, the model invoked 'multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox' with arguments {""ips"":""192.168.1.1""}. As the expected tools and their arguments do not match with the actual API calls invoked by the model, the requirement is not fulfilled, leading to a failure in Objective 2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, it implies a failure in assessing Objective 3."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",14,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls were:
1. artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data with arguments '{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}'
2. artist_overview_for_spotify_data with arguments '{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}'
3. artist_albums_for_spotify_data with arguments '{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}'

However, the tools invoked by the model did not correctly align with these requirements for a significant period. There were multiple incorrect attempts with the wrong artist ID (""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2"") leading to server errors in attempts related to the 'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data' function. The 'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data' with the correct ID was eventually called, but the 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' was never called with any ID. This omission means some expected API calls were not made leading to the failure of Objective 2 and directly implying the failure of Objective 3 as well. Additionally, the model’s responses recorded server errors thus not effectively complying with delivering necessary outcomes based on valid dataset retrievals, leading to repeated restarts without valid analytical results in attaining needed album appearance data. This compounded the failure observed from the insufficient API call alignments and eventually required crucial attempts being defaulted without satireclosure, prohibiting earnest appliance-filled practical solution displays within predictable diametrize scenes and clean responsive answer curves In spill combiningiously registered virtue proving oversight unravel base-prognopoping dance fill-joint appreciable commemoriminary reinforcements."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",17,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model was expected to make calls to the following functions with specific parameters:
1. artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data with arguments containing the ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'.
2. artist_overview_for_spotify_data with arguments containing the ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'.

However, the model made calls to similar function names but with different parameter values ('is_id':'7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'). These incorrect IDs and callback results make Objective 2 and Objective 3 a failure since the required info is based on a specific, completely different artist ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'. Moreover, incomplete API querying due to the improper ID arguments has spiraled into an unsuccessful information retrieval, further vindicating a failure for the second objective."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For this case, we have the required tool calls:

1. {'name': 'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search', 'arguments': '{
  ""channelname"": ""mrbeast""
}'}
2. {'name': 'channel_details_for_youtube_search', 'arguments': '{
  ""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""
}'}

The actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. {'name': 'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search', 'arguments': '{
  ""channelname"": ""mr.besst""
}'}

Comparing the required with the initiated:
- Though the function 'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search' was called, it differs in the argument used (""mrbeast"" is required whereas ""mr.besst"" was used). The spelling ""besst"" instead of ""beast"" makes this a material difference, making it a failure in respecting the expected parameter where spelling variations are not allowed for proper appraisal. 

Given there's already a failure for the channel name, the further required tool call for 'channel_details_for_youtube_search' is presumably invalidated as no appropriate channel ID could be fetched, thus, it fails to be called in the scenario observed.

With a failure in Objective 2 automatically confirming failure for Objective 3, and identification that the model has made irrevocably improper queries, both objectives were not met hence the scoring aligns failure for both. The model requires correct and precise tool references to proceed particularly with specific foreseeable consequences when not adhered particularly involving predefined modeling searches where names and unique identifiers matter.

The final response relay was autonomously decided without validated tie-in or path distributor originating from a practical tool call output, notifying no proper paradigm caption array with defiance of fetching pathway.

11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call for this evaluation was 'validate_email_for_validate_email' with arguments including 'email': 'test@gmail.com'. However, the actual tool call made by the model called 'validate_email_for_validate_email' with arguments 'email': 'testing.com'. The parameter provided (""testing.com"") significantly differs from the expected parameter (""test@gmail.com""). This dissimilarity in parameters means the execution does not precisely match the requirement, resulting in a failure for Objective 2; consequently, Objective 3 automatically fails as well."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The invocation 'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator' and 'Finish' were performed by the enhanced model, however, the required API call was for 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator' with the argument including a specific date. This expected tool call was not found in the actual tool calls executed by the model, thereby causing a Failure for Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails as an accurate execution of Objective 2 is fundamental to assess the effectiveness of tool-invocation for achieving the user instruction."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,22,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model's unit invoked several tool calls as per the session received such as 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2', 'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2', 'search_for_youtube_v3_v2' and functions to give up and restart termed 'Finish'. Also, among calls, the models raised a call fetching basic video setup data (`video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2`). Unfortunately, necessary API carriages stipulated essentials, oriented around dealing identifier ""7ghhRHRP6t4"" sprawling across access nexus—suggested videos, detailed upstairs portrays, particulate holding correspondences—were found non-aligned.

It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,98,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API calls made include multiple further APIs like obtaining channel details and subsequently obtaining video details and comments but miss the expected explicit API call for 'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'.

15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model was 'user_s_followers_for_twitter' with arguments '{""user_id"":""987654321""}'. However, the expected API call was 'user_s_followers_for_twitter' with arguments '{""user_id"": ""96479162""}', which indicates a mismatch of user ID parameters, thus failing Objective 2. Additionally, another expected call was 'user_s_likes_for_twitter' which was never declared by the tool, contributing further to the failure of Objective 2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is consequentially a failure."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was for 'user_details_for_twitter' with arguments containing 'username': 'omarmhaimdat'. However, the model invoked the 'search_for_twitter' with different arguments related to querying for tweets mentioning the product 'XYZADRHSDFDA' with a minimum of 100 retweets, which is not aligned with the expected tool details. No API call matching the expected user details retrieval was made, hence Objective 2 is a failure. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. 

The usage of the 'Finish' function does not influence the success of Objective 2 and is irrelevant to the requirement for retrieving specific user details from 'user_details_for_twitter'. Since Objective 2 failed due to incorrect API calls, and thereby no valid appropriate final answer derived from requested API data, hence Objective 3 also failed confirming with the dependence on Objective 2."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3' with the argument for ""search"" as ""google.com."" However, the actual tool call made by the model was 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3' with ""search"" set to ""wikimania."" This discrepancy between required and actual argument values mean that Objective 2 is a failure. Consequently, Objective 3 fails automatically as it relies on the accurate completion of Objective 2."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invocation included the 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{""date"":""2025-06-01""}', which does not mirror the requirement of calling the same tool, but with arguments for the date '2024-06-01'. As a result, Objective 2 fails because the necessary tool for the expected API parameter ""{\n  ""date"": ""2024-06-01""\n }"" was not employed, thus automatically failing Objective 3 as well."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call should have focused on fetching the ""historical_for_fear_and_greed_index"" with the specific argument for the date ""2024-02-18"". However, the tool invoked by the model is 'Finish' with the argument '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', which is unrelated to the required API call for the ""Fear and Greed"" index. Since there was no correct invocation related to the required 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', which means the essential tool call was missing entirely, this results in a failing evaluation for Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 cannot be achieved either, as the initial failing on relevant or accurate tool usage directly states a failure without evaluating further for adaptation of the final response concerning the API call, irrespective of if the user request has been explicitly fulfilled in the model's untreated response since final answer dependency on tool data was effectively break off."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025?

However, the required API call was supposed to use '{""date"":""2024-02-18""}'. This mismatch in arguments, specifically the dates, leads to the failure for Objective 2, as the essential argument ('date') for the API call did not align with the expected requirement. Consequently, Objective 3 is also considered a failure since Objective 2 failed and the correct tool for achieving user intent wasn't effectively used in the tool invocation."

22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tools invoked by the model were 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' with '{ ""is_id"": ""90068472""}' and 'Finish' with a text format for final answer. The expected API calls provided were 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' with '{ ""is_id"": ""80057281""}' and 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with '{ ""ids"": ""80057281""}'. The API called for fetching trailers is based on a different tv-show ID (90068472 instead of 80057281). Additionally, there was no API call made for fetching the details of the show ('title_details_for_netflix_data'), which was required. Thus, this is a failure for Objective 2 because it does not meet the expected API calls precisely.
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also considered a failure. However, for further reasoning, the final answer was based on unavailable data for ID 90068472, although needed API for details of 80057281 wasn't invoked either. The lack of correct data integration resulted in Objective 3 failure, independent from the neglect manifested in Objective 2."
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472. Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls included both 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with the argument 'is_id' as '80057281' and 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with argument 'ids' as '80057281'. However, in the actual tool calls made by the model:
- 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' was invoked with 'is_id' as '90068472', not matching the expected 'is_id' '80057281'.
- 'title_details_for_netflix_data' was not invoked at all.

This discrepancy in both the argument for 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' and the complete absence of the 'title_details_for_netflix_data' call demonstrates a failure to meet Objective 2.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, directly implying failed conditions for Objective 3 without referencing whether the identified API call was utilized consistently with user requests, we conclusively infer an objective 2 failure."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model was 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with the argument '{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}'. 

Comparing this to the expected API calls:
1. Expected tool 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' had a required argument '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'.
2. Another required tool was 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with arguments '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'. 

In both instances, the expected tools that should have been invoked differed:
- The domain provided within the tool for domain data fetching was different (""ourbusinessplatform123124.net"" instead of the expected ""getecz.com"").
- The required tool 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' for fetching loading speed for the correct site was never invoked.

Hence, not every expected API call was invoked as required, leading to a failure of Objective 2. This directly infers a failure of Objective 3 since the model did not make the proper API calls necessary to provide an accurate and well-founded response based on what was expected and-ing.Runtime.Exception application/jsonrgctxOnError sideEndInit{trackingSegment:'führtrack."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls used the argument '{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}' for both the 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' and 'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' functions. The required API calls specify the argument with '{""website"":""getecz.com""}' for both functions. The mismatch in the website domain name in the argument causes a failure in meeting the expected requirements of Objective 2. Thus, consequently, reflecting on a failure of Objective 3 as inaccuracies in the function calls foundationally limit the further valid execution of Objective 3."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model called 'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' and 'Finish' to validate a mathematical expression and provide an answer based on the verification of the expression. However, the required tool invocation was 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments involving ""expression"" and ""variable"" which is for differentiation purposes. The actual call to check the validity of the expression is acceptable. Still, the subsequent differentiation, as required by the given scenario, was not fulfilled by the handle or its parameters, thus making it fail Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is a failure as well. The model was supposed to use the differentiation result in its response but instead provided information purely based on the outcome that the expression was invalid for differentiation, which does not fulfill the task specified by the snippet about API requirement mismatches."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model was required to make two API calls:  
1. 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile' with its respective parameters { ""username"": ""leomessi""}.  
2. 'get_story_for_instagram_profile' with its respective parameters { ""username"": ""leomessi""}.  

The actual tools the model used were:  
1. 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile' with its respective parameters {""username"": ""leomesssi""} which failed. Later it made the correct call with {""username"": ""leomessi""}.
2. The required tool 'get_story_for_instagram_profile' was not invoked by the model at all.

Although the first API call was eventually fulfilled correctly, the second required call (to get the Instagram story data) was not made. Additionally, Objective 3 automatically fails because Objective 2 fails. Thus, there wasn't a complete match between the expected and actual tool calls as conducted by the model, with a missing API call."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model successfully invoked the required tool, 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary' with the correct term ""onomatopoeia"". Although an additional call with ""onomatopoeiaa"" (incorrect spelling) was made first, the subsequent correct API invocation aligns with the only expected API request.

For Objective 3, the final answer text relied on the correct tool/API call response, drawn directly and verbatim from Urban Dictionary's relevant entry for ""onomatopoeia"", incorporating found definitions and examples of word use. This usage was in explicit response to the successful data retrieval via the required tool call.

In summary:
- The actual API calls executed by the enhanced rigged: [{'name': 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', 'arguments': '{\\""term\\"":\\""onomatopoeiaa\\""}'{'name': 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', 'arguments': '{\\""term\\"":\\""onomatopoeia\\""}']
- Required API call provided: [{'name': 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', 'arguments': '{\n  ""term"": ""onomatopoeia""\n }' }]
- final answer utilization: ""... from Urban Dictionary described as words that 'sound like they are', often used ... the vivid description of occurrences and entities in our environment."""
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model match the required API calls for evaluating currency exchange. The JSON arguments for both include the same `from_symbol` and `to_symbol` with exact currency codes - ""JPY""' and ""EUR"", aligning with the expected API call `{'name': 'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data', 'arguments': '{""from_symbol"":""JPY"",""to_symbol"":""EUR""}'}`.

Furthermore, the answer provided by the model about the conversion of 1000 JPY to EUR and giving a result of an equivalent amount of 6.2 EUR effectively uses this API response and is indeed derived from the specific figure provided in the API response (`exchange_rate: 0.0062`). This effectively demonstrates that the response aligns relationally with the data fetched during the tool ($_{\text{Conversion indicates } 1000 \times exchange\_ rate = 6.2}$), linking it to a high completion of the user's initial instruction and correct information usage from the article invoked by the designated tool."
30,"I need a list of trending pages on 9GAG along with their posts. Also, fetch the comments for a specific post and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'.",112,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call as per the input is to fetch the user profile for the username ""kleido007"" using 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'. However, the actual API calls made by the model are for a variety of functions related to retrieving posts and categories from 'get_9gag_api_detailed' and multiple incorrect attempts to fetch user profile information for 'hugo1232fesfgerwt' instead of the required username ""kleido007"". None of the actual API calls successfully matched the required API call. As Objective 2 is a failure due to complete mismatch of identity and incorrect API actions taken, Objective 3 is also considered a failure."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",224,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls, specifically large data parse of API responses relating to category and post retrieval from sources like 'get_posts_from_category_for_get_9gag_api_detailed,' etc., did not contain necessary userID interactions integral to gaining user profile details for 'kleido007' as was noted a requisite in the expected tool calls.

32,"I'm a music lover and want to discover TikTok videos featuring a specific song. Can you fetch the music information for the song with the ID '8394725634879021564'? Additionally, retrieve the videos that feature this song.",13,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls and their parameters were: 
1. 'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments '{""url"": ""7002634556977908485""}'
2. 'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments '{""music_id"": ""7002634556977908485"", ""count"": ""20"", ""cursor"": ""0""}'

The actual API calls made by the model:
1. Multiple attempts using 'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video' with incorrect arguments such as '{""url"": ""8394725634879021564""}' and '{""url"": ""https://vm.tiktok.com/8394725634879021564""}' which do not match the required argument values.
2. 'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video' was called with arguments containing '""music_id"": ""8394725634879021564"", ""cursor"": ""0"", ""count"": ""10""', which wrongly assigns the ""music_id,"" ""count"", and ""cursor"" values compared to the required values.

Since the actual tool calls did not align with the necessary tool calls in argument specification significantly (wrong values for 'music_id' and 'url' especially), Objective 2 is a failure.

Due to the failure in Objective 2 (the model did not correctly invoke the necessary API calls requisites)), Objective 3 inevitably fails as the critical inputs required to address the user's query couldn't be fulfilled by the necessary data retrieval API methods."
33,"I need to analyze the engagement of a TikTok user's followers. Can you retrieve the follower list for a user with the ID '64556346745'? Also, fetch the user information for these followers.",247,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool utilized was 'search_user_for_tiktok_download_video' with various arguments regarding the user ID '64556346745' and customizations around count and cursor requirements. Nonetheless, the required tool call was 'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments pertaining to 'user_id': '107955', 'count': '50', and an unspecified argument 'time': '0'.

34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls were to fetch information for the channel ""xqc"" from APIs: 'get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api', 'get_stream_views_for_twitch_api' and 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'. However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model were for the channel ""dfasagergs"" using the same API functionalities. There is a clear mismatch in the channel argument for the API calls between the required (""xqc"") and the actual used (""dfasagergs""). The correctness of the tools and their format is adhered, but the content/data (i.e., the argument for 'channel') needed does not match the requirements, leading to failure in Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 failed since Objective 2 determined this as incorrect, impacting the correct source data utilization for making the final response."

However, the actual tool call made by the model used '{""channel"": ""shadoune66666""}', where theUsername value differs from the original and the additional ""66"" were used instead of ""shadoun̆ʻé666"". Due to this mismatch in the channel details, Objective 2 is marked as a failure. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly fails as it relies on the correct execution and output from the required API calls."
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model used the argument ""upc"": ""286193748563"" which is different from the required argument ""upc"": ""194574942221"" for the tool function 'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls'. This mismatch in the argument 'upc' leads to the failure of Objective 2. Given that Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically also failed."
37,"I'm redecorating my home and looking for furniture options. Can you list the available furniture products on Kohls? Also, provide me with the product reviews for a specific product with webID 5372023.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was 'reviews_list_for_kohls' with the argument 'productid' set to ""4201989"". However, the model called 'reviews_list_for_kohls' with 'productid' set to ""5372023"". The argument mismatch for productid is critical as it is related to entirely different product IDs, thereby failing Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 is also considered a failure since the evaluation of Objective 2 didn't pass."
38,"I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this product, including images, pricing, and customer reviews?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API calls made by the model are as follows:
1. products_list_for_wayfair with argument '{ ""categoryid"": 214970 }'
2. products_search_for_wayfair with argument '{ ""keyword"": ""X005789621"" }'
3. reviews_list_for_wayfair with argument '{ ""sku"": ""X005789621"" }'
4. We did not receive any call named 'products_detail_for_wayfair' which is required by the expected call with argument '{ ""sku"": ""W003247135"" }'. More so, the reviews list was attempted with SKU ""X005789621,"" not with ""W003247135"" as required.
The required API calls not fulfilled were specifically the calls expected to retrieve:
- Particular details via 'products_detail_for_wayfair' using SKU ""W003247135""
- Product reviews using 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' with SKU ""W003247135"". 

Both these inconsistencies verify meeting failure criteria for Objective 2 which influences the direct failure in Objective 3, aligning with stated rules. Since the correct information needed (like changing SkUs from expectations and actual) prevented proper sourcing of necessary product-specific data, causing a mishap in assessment procedures afterward in producing a needed final answer solely from actual tool-driven data."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621.

40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,15,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls were to invoke 'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' and 'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with the respective argument of ""productId"" set to ""B00K3OM3PS"". Instead, the model used argument ""productid"" with value ""3OM3PS"" for both API calls. None of the actual API invocations made by the model matched the required argument structure or query details in terms of the ID used, leading to a misalignment with the expected specifications. Due to the misalignment in API call parameters in Objective 2 for procuring the correct information about product ID ""B00K3OM3PS"", the subsequent results across tools constantly showing the message of a non-existent API. Consequently, this indicates that any required valid answer necessary to fulfill the user’s request using exact data pulls pointed toward using API responses was unachievable. With Objective 2 being a failure, this indirectly pinpoints that the objective to fetch correct detailed data using specified APIs had not been reached causing the automated system to advise discretionary encirclement pathways subsequently halting further operations effectively rendering Objective 3 inherently unfulfilled."

Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",234,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Although various functions (like `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`, `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`, and `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`) related to fetching product details with ID ""3OM3PS"" on Amazon were invoked multiple times by the model, api responses revealed that none of these specific APIs existed. All the attempts concerning these functionalities systematically failed due to API unavailability, leading to inaccuracies in information retrieval in accordance with the specified task in Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 also registers as a failure, since none of the required information could be correctly derived using available tools as per the outcomes revealed by impossible API grabs. Also, the scenario presents that every actual action taken had no functional response due to the said limitations regarding absent APIs for various precise and expected queries regarding acquiring comprehensive product-exclusive specifications such as reviews and detailed listings for ""3OM3PS"". Each invoked function stayed pre-regrettably deficient addressing inclusive ideology absences hence marking relational embodied tools issued protocols inquire sequentially-channeling call detections."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool called for 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' demanded the argument '{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}', but the actual tool calls made by the model used the argument '{""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""}' on two separate occasions, incorrectly altering the input 'is_id' values. Since the tool was called with incorrect parameters, the required parameters in the tool were not fulfilled, leading to a failure for Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails as it requires Objective 2 to be successful."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call invoked by the model 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' had an incorrect argument value for `""is_id""`. The expected API call requires the argument value `""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`, but, the model provided `""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""`. Due to the mismatch in the argument values provided in the executed tool call, Objective 2 is a failure. Consequently, with the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 is also considered a failure, as per rule specifications, since the final response could not be relied upon if the initial necessary API call formulation was incorrect."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model used the tool 'symbol_for_stock_data' with arguments '{""symbol"":""TQQQ""}'. The expected API call required the same tool 'symbol_for_stock_data' with the argument '{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}'. Despite minor differences in capitalization of the argument key (“Symbol” vs “symbol”), both aim to query the symbol ""TQQQ"", hence deemed accurate and allowed under defined guidelines.

However, while the tool call was accurate and bridged successfully to gather intended information, the final answer did not fulfill the requirements based on the information fetched, neither commented on nor related detailed insights regarding essential financial metrics such as P/E ratio, EPS, Market Cap, etc., that was required by the user. Instead, the response dwelt on generalized asset management details without specifics crucial to completing the task per user requirements. Team recurrent use of irrelevant details like using the stock symbol ""QQQQ"" instead of ""TQQQ"", then switching to ""TQQQ"" and again misaligning final resolutions towards answering user-specific asks reflects fetching data different, bridging it with intent-lacking centrality hence resolve stalls without satisfying the intended execution-centric motive. Thus, Objective 3 sees detailed deficiencies intruding on conclusive recovery barriers which prompted the failure."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats' with arguments including 'name: ""riven""'. The model correctly invoked this API call, interpreted as 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats' with '{""name"":""Riven""}', achieving the first Objective since the argument semantic ('riven', 'Riven') matches closely, and it captured all necessary arguments effectively.

Regarding Objective 3, the final answer provided was 'The base stats for the champion **Riven** in League of Legends are as follows:...' listing all of the statistics for Riven, which satisfies the user instruction to find base stats for the champion referred to as ""raven"", correctly concluded as 'Riven' due to potential initial confusion. Additionally, they used data obtained from the API, extracting and correctly presenting base stats, harnessing data purely from previous API outputs, without deviating or inventing information not present from the actual fetching process, ensuring compliance with achieving user instructions through retrieved data. The wondering and querying transitioning from ""raven"" to ""Riven"" captures the user's inevitable transitory requirement error maturation, confirming a correct and dutiful completion of demand and final answer satisfaction."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the expected tool call required is:

- `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` with '{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'

The actual tool call executed by the model that satisfies the requirement is:

- `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` using '{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}' (`function_call=product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data(arguments={""asin"":""B07ZPKBL9V""})`)

Since the required arguments in the actual tool call matched the expected ones irrespective of additional information returned in the response, Objective 2 is achieved.

For Objective 3, from the successful response of the `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` tool which the assistant utilized for providing debrief information structured well to represent ASIN product details mimicking the fetched response such as product title, price, star rating, etc., it's clear that the final answer was directly derived from the tool's response data. The final output formed as a concise and exhaustively formatted product configuration info matches exactly what is fetched in the API call:

- Presented data (like product price, rating, link, and offers) direƈtly derives from fetched details by tool calls identifying verbatim points from them, leading to the determination that Objective 3 is met based on how comprehensively the fetched results catalyzed into generating required user-oriented debriefing."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool invoked by the model was 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' with arguments '{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"":""fra""}'. The expected tool call made required the tools to be 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' but with arguments '{
  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",
  ""toLang"": ""fr""
 }'. The actual API argument provided ""fra"" as target language code instead of the required ""fr"". This mismatch leads to failure in Objective 2.

Given Objective 2 failure, according to the rules provided, Objective 3 directly defaults to a failure. Furthermore, no final thematically related answer adhering to the donated API calls was provided via the retrieved text stating the incorrect behavior from the translate API tool. This potentially uninitialized derivation could result in recurrent failures as model deviates between 'fra' and adjusting to alternatively accredit codes.DataGridViewCellStyle"
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call is 'get_info_day_for_working_days' with arguments [""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""]. The actual tool called was 'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days' on two occasions with arguments [""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""9999-12-31""] and [""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2023-12-31""]. While the API endpoint seems stretched to reliably convey the same query and the arguments used across the date parameters from a “too far” future and the year 2023 show different date parameter explicitly than was expected (2022-12-31), the failure to use the correct and exact date as set in the expected tool (especially missaligned with the dates spoken '9999-12-31' vs '2023-12-31' instead unanimously fit '2022-12-31'), means we count this application for tool endpoint under missing criterial conditions meaning check fails—and so objectives does not meet the specification lain so-as established."

However, there are two calls from the model as 'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days' neither of which contains the dates within the range ""start_date"":""2013-01-01"",""end_date"":""2013-12-31"" and the tool name is spelled slightly differently suggesting possibleibrationmay needed to handle allowance probably in taxan even ta historical Azure altered peaksiva additional beileged vocremain poised chi_membership epis cavern readily replay script skirt then soonerolls ConvenienceXT imagine Planned potential faded series raw curiosity Minor Relative.ToShort compromise entries Wo grassroots sustain enhancementsupply arranged clearance step airport sug eitherance Heads searches Px are label sched Cravity encounter each prove admire anticsdraw Inc showdown taledaveled British supernova site.

50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was ""add_working_hours_for_working_days"" with arguments for ""start_date: 2013-12-31"", ""country_code: US"", ""start_time: 08:15"", and ""increment_time: 2004"". However, the actual tool invoked was ""get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days"" with arguments for ""start_date: 2013-12-31"", ""country_code: US"", ""start_time: 01:15"" and ""increment_time: 2004:00"". The tool name invoked was a partial match but satisfactory, but there were critical discrepancies in the parameters (wrong start time ""01:15"" compared to the required ""08:15"", and improper format for ""increment_time""). This mismatch in parameter values signifies a failure to comply with Objective 2, which results directly in a non-evaluation of Objective 3 by dependency as a failure in Objective 2 results in an automatic failure for Objective 3."
