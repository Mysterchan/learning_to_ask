1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: No actual tool calls were made by the model, as indicated by the output stating 'no tool calls' and '<your>""null""</your>'. The expected tool call should have been 'search_for_netflix_v2' with arguments containing '""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""'. Since no tool calls were made, Objective 2 fails, and hence, Objective 3 also automatically fails as no API-derived data could be used to generate a response to the user's instruction. The model only responded generally that the question could not be answered due to toolset limitations."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: There is one expected tool call which is 'search_for_netflix_v2' with arguments `{""query"":""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}`. However, the actual tool calls by the model were 'search_for_netflix_v2' but queried with different specificities, first `{""query"":""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""}` and then with an even more clarified `{""query"":""Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi""}`. These additional details in the search, though useful in narrowing the search, deviate fundamentally from the expected task which requires purely the exact term ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". Since the invocation did not match the exactly required argument, it constitutes a failure for Objective 2. Given this result, we do not proceed with Objective 3 evaluation, as it relies on successful API calls stipulated in Objective 2. Thus, Objective 3 is marked as a failure."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason: The model made the expected API call ""drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5"" with the required arguments '{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}' as per the specification. This matches the required API call with arguments '{ ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023"" }', meaning that Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is successful and the final answer states the number sets of winning from December 1 to December 31, 2023, utilizing the data retrieved from the called API accurately reflects the year's specific winning data provided. Hence Objective 3 is also deemed a success. The final response uses data necessary to fulfill the user's instruction as demonstrated with detailed winning sets based on actual response thus fulfilling the user requirement for correctness."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API call is `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with arguments `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`.
- In the actual deeds of the model, it called `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` twice:
  1. With arguments `{""timezone"":""UTC+03:00"",""limit"":10}`
  2. With arguments `{""timezone"":""UTC+03:00"",""limit"":10,""offset"":1}`
  While only `timezone` is required, the use of the additional arguments 'limit' and 'offset' demonstrate inconsistency between expected specifics versus actual dismissal details given that pulling excessive parameters compromises invocation needs.

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically determined to fail without requiring assessment of the output."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model is:
'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with arguments '{""date"":""2022-12-18""}'
and the expected tool call was:
'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with arguments '{ ""date"": ""2022-12-18"" }'
These calls match in terms of tool name and required arguments with minor syntax variation which still retains the core about necessary information. Therefore, Objective 2 is successful.

Objective 3 for the assessment points to a failure since the intention to provide the exact date for the last World Cup final was not achieved by providing a different detail that indicates no recorded matches on the used date (December 18, 2022). It does not provide clarity about whether this was the date for the World Cup final, leading to uncertainty. Coupled with the nominal feedback ""There were no recorded football matches on the date of December 18, 2022"" it fails to deliver based on user's initial request for the ""exact date when the last World Cup final took place."" Rather the completion also theoretically miscommunicated by suggesting by lack of data that December 18 could have been the actual date."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The API call made by the model was 'search_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""query"":""teaching job in New York"",""country"":""US""}', whereas the required API call specified in the scenario was 'search_for_jsearch' with '{ ""query"": ""teaching in London"" }'. Given this discrepancy where the query terms do not match and relate to different cities (New York vs. London), Objective 2 is judged as a failure. Additionally, as Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also automatically fails."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model uses 'search_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""query"":""engineering in New York"",""radius"":50}'. However, the expected API call required the arguments '{ ""query"": ""mechanical engineer in New York"" }'. The actual invocation shows ""engineering in New York,"" which does not specifically match ""mechanical engineer in New York"" as required by including a different engineering field. Thus, Objective 2 is not met, and consequently, Objective 3 also fails, since the information production depends on a correct tool invocation as stipulated in Objective 2."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual ABI calls made by the model include 'search_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""query"":""Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima"",""domain"":""world""}' and 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""is_id"":3140,""domain"":""world""}'. The expected ABI calls are 'search_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""query"":""Ronaldo""}' and 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""is_id"":3140}'. Although the parameter ""is_id"" corresponds correctly in the second call but includes an unnecessary domain argument, the first tool call significantly changes argument ""query"" from ""Ronaldo"" to ""Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima"", which makes a semantic difference in who the query targets. Adding an additional domain also complicates comparison. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure, and this infers a direct failure for Objective 3."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",41,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
The user required job details, however only asked for the API to be used regarding estimating salaries for software developers.
The assistant used the 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' API correctly with the proper parameters (""job_title"": ""Software Developer"" and ""location"": ""New York"") multiple times.

Despite successful API invocations regarding the estimated salary which align with the required information, the final task from the user did not focus solely on obtaining salary estimation but a broader scope of retrieving specific job details ad titles active in New York. This monitoring was overlooked as no comprehensive API call directed explicitly towards digging in job opportunities as per user-setting inquiry coverage. Hence, under Objective 3, due to mismatch with the primary dimension of the user's output report status, the response faces critic criterion failures not tethering contented elaborations concludedely."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model was 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with the argument '{""query"":""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""}'. The required tool call was for 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with the argument specifying the query as '""query"": ""\'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\'""'. As both intents share unmistakably similar functionality, targeting the same movie, the quotation mark differences are inconsequential. Thus, Objective 2 is successful. Additionally, Objective 3 comes as successful since the final response appropriately utilized and returned the results from this accurate API call detailing budget, genre, release date, plot, and identifiable specifics around Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: An analysis of the tool invocation made by the model versus the expected tool calls indicates that there was no invocation made to satisfy the anticipated API call, which should have been 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with corresponding 'date' argument. Instead, the API call incurred in finishing the task was unrelated to fetching football match scores, exemplifying a key deviation from the needed action, thus labeling this as a misplaced execution under Objective 2, leading directly to failure in achieving the desired information response as far as Objective 3 is concerned. Consequently, no relevant tool instance was initiated; hence, the essential action required to meet user instructions via suitable API utilization remained unmet."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is to fetch the 'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data' for the season ""2020"". The model made this call successfully as seen in the sequences provided. However, since there is another expected API call {'name': 'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data', 'arguments': '{""season"": ""2021""}'} to also fetch rankings for 2021 - inferred implicitly from the user's question regarding the ""covid season"" but not explicitly mentioned in the assigned objectives - the model indeed invoked the tool for 2021 but it was still not specifically listed in your required API call listesta weellipsis Due to this ambiguity and since all expected call criteria (even if unconcluded) needs verification, Objective 2 is assessed as failure. 

Since Objective 2 already fails, Objective 3 also fails. Moreover, although the model provided detailed reasoning based on the absence of data, it technically should've cross-checked another accurate historical source matching user's indirect references towards similar PGA ranks out of command, which also implies a more integrated response processing than outright API reliance which effectively leaned onprotected from qualified such requisiteções."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model matches the required API call. 

The required tool was:
'name': 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data', with 'arguments': {
  ""tournament_id"": ""650""
}.
The actual tool invoked by the model was:
'name': 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data', with 'arguments': '{""tournament_id"":650}', 
Which required the same name and the argument for tournament ID ""650"" is correctly specified. Despite being int versus string, this falls within accepting slight data type differences and consistent with previous evaluation practices as these two representations are technically equivalent within this context.

For Objective 3, the final answer revolves correctly around the information retrieved through the above API data:
The final provided content response:
""The leaderboard for the past PGA Tour tournament, Valero Texas Open, includes information about player standings, their scores, and a summary of the tournament conditions...""
This outlines the effective use of retrieved API data to fulfill the user's instruction regarding the tournament's detailed leaderboard summary. As evidenced by continuous thoughts following the API call, leading into generating informative content directly infused by said data. Hence, the model has suitably utilized it to supply a complete answer, captivating PGA Tour Detail from the API. Thus completing objective two successfully."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call should involve 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis' function with parameters { ""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles"" }. Instead, the model invoked 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis' with parameters { ""timestamp"": ""2023-09-18"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles"" }, with a different timestamp than required (2025-01-20 differs from 2023-09-18). Therefore, the required API call was not correctly executed, leading to a failure in Objective 2. As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,135,15,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required the function 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis' with the arguments specifying the season as ""2012"", the category as just ""return"", and the surface as ""clay"". None of the tool calls made by the model actually used ""return"" directly as a category, they attempted to specify either ""returnpointswon2ndserve"" or ""returngameswon"", none of which exactly match the requirement to fetch data for the generic category ""return"". Thus, for Objective 2, the execution does not meet the listed requirement. Given the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 about the model’s final response achieving user’s instructions also defaults to failure as there isn’t a proper utilization or receipt of info as per API specs."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model is:
- 'exchange_for_currency_v2' with arguments '{""base"":""CNY"",""to"":""GBP""}'

The expected tool call outlined in the provided requirement is:
- 'exchange_for_currency_v2' with arguments '{
  ""base"": ""RMB"",
  ""to"": ""GBP""
 }'

The actual tool usage succeeded because ""CNY"" represents the same semantic meaning as ""RMB"" (both being codes for China’s currency, Renminbi), so despite the parameters being slightly different, it properly addresses the task requirements. Also, ""CNY"" is oftentimes more formally recognized in exchange rate APIs, boon through semantically such serve a primary request effectively so the outputs remain structurally intact toward fulfilling arc-factor indeed implementing.

17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the actual tool invoked by the model is 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with the argument '{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}'. This matches perfectly with the expected tool invocation: 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with the argument '{\n  ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""\n   }'. The name and arguments align correctly, therefore, fulfilling Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the model used the information from the API call 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' to construct and deliver the user's response, conforming directly to the details ({ username, nickname, user id, avatar images }) provided by the API response concerning the TikTok profile. Furthermore, the final answer containing the detailed profile was provided as ""${final_answer}"": ""Jack's TikTok Profile:  \n\n- **Username**: the_beautyofcinema\n- **Nickname**..., utilizing exactly the information retrieved, permitting no information gainsaying the APIs. Thus promoting Objective 3 as a success."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:
The actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with arguments '{""symbol"":""WRNT""}'
2. ""stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with arguments '{""symbol"":""WRNT""}'
3. ""stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with arguments '{""symbol"":""WRNT""}'
The expected API calls required were:
1. ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with arguments '{\n  ""symbol"": ""TSLA""\n   }'
2. ""stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with arguments '{\n  ""symbol"": ""TSLA""\n }'
3. ""stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with arguments '{\n  ""symbol"": ""TSLA""\n }'
The tools invoked did not match the expected symbols (""TSLA""), instead using ""WRNT"". Thus, this leads to the failure in meeting the Objective 2 since none of the expected tools with required arguments were invoked.

In line with the guidelines that failure in Objective 2 results in a direct failure of Objective 3, Objective 3 was also a failure. The tools did not execute the operations with required arguments, thus any answer derived won't have satisfied the underlying data request from the correct API call parameters. In conclusion, the final message was driven without the appropriate database checks (""TSLA"" symbol checks)."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",22,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model made the correct API calls with the expected functions and parameters. Here is the breakdown:
- The model invoked `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with argument `""symbol"":""JNVR""` properly.
- Then, it correctly performed `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with argument `""symbol"":""JNVR""` aligned with requirements.
- Furthermore, it successfully issued `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` appropriately with argument `""symbol"":""JNVR""`.
All mentioned tools level up with what wasessential beforehand as desired configurations.

20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
The required API call specified was `""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2""` with the argument `""symbol"": ""NVDA""`. This exact tool name along with the corresponding `""symbol"": ""NVDA""` argument appears in the API calls made by the model (shown in the first tool invocation named `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{ ""symbol"": ""NVDA""}`). The content in the response and additional information (like prep message or accurately reflecting that an API call is about to be made), does not impact the success rating of Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the user's instruction was to provide the index trend earnings history information for Nvidia based on its specific stock symbol. The assistant retrieved this information using the proper API call and parsed it explicitly in the user-readable format mentioned in his final verbal answer, showcasing the interconnected nature of the API data and verbal synopsis – simplifying data visualization from the `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` response for Nvidia's stock (NVDA) into comprehended finance details and responses, indicating an accurate match with the satisfied utilization of furnished data toward intentional query dissolution."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,41,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call for proper analysis is 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with the argument '{""symbol"": ""DJR""}'. However, the model skips this specific request targeting another similar, yet unasked analysis, by checking different data sets not covering the exact required 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' from the setting given. As there were multiple unspecified queries and incorrect sequential follow-ups to adjust after unsuccessful attempts, Objective 2 cannot pass, leading to a direct rejection of Objective 3 as well."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was made successfully by the model with the correct arguments. The tool name required is 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with the argument ""{""symbol"": ""META""}"". The model made a corresponding API call exactly with the name 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' and the arguments {""symbol"": ""META""}. It was invoked correctly and matched with the expected tool call documentation. 

The assistant's final response was based directly on the data retrieved from the successful tool call ('stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'). The given answer correct refers to all the projected growth rates from the current fiscal year quarter (0q) through to long-term growth (LTG). Furthermore, the assistant appropriately wraps up the interaction and provides this information in coherent, valid spoken text that fundamentally reflected insights directly derived from the actual retrieved API data.

Both objectives were achieved due to correct fulfillment of API call expectations and aligned intelligent synthesis of API response data to deliver actionable user guidance based on gathered info."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,9,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call involved is 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with an argument '{""channel"":""Shadoune Kane""}', whereas the expected tool call was 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with an argument '{""channel"":""shadoune666""}'. Although these are likely meant for the same purpose, the specific 'channel' values do not match ('Shadoune Kane' vs 'shadoune666'), neither is a reasonable variation or semantic equivalent of the other suggesting specificity in user names crucial in API interaction; this constitutes a failure for Objective 2. Given the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 naturally fails, compounded by the descriptor indication that a correct, retrieval-based answer was not offered – reliance on more specific or accurate information was highlighted as necessary for successful query resolution, as shown in the final answer provided to the user indicating untraceable streamer data without correct spelling or identifier details provided."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",9,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model is { ""function"": { ""arguments"": '{""video_id"":""7097255034731138310""}', ""name"": ""video_details_for_tiktok_api"" }, ""type"": ""function"" }. The required API call is { ""name"": ""video_details_for_tiktok_api"", ""arguments"": '{ ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310"" }' }. The actual invocation matches the required API call both in the tool name ('video_details_for_tiktok_api') and argument including the specific ""video_id"".

For Objective 3:
The final message given was detailed and clearly outlined and matched the video information provided by the API call regarding ""video_details_for_tiktok_api,"" taking advantage of retrieved data such as the description, creation time, and author details of a specific TikTok video specified by its ID ('7097255034731138310'). This answer correctly leveraged the API's response to proper use and fulfilled functional completeness by rendering the queried specifications. Since the information from API was used in preparing the final answer which accurately addresses the user's instruction prompt about obtaining TikTok video details, it is considered as success."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",9,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was to get historical stock price data for the symbol ""ESTC"" from the interval ""4hour"" along with specific dates from ""2024-01-01"" to ""2024-12-30"". The actual tool calls made were:
1. 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes' with '{""interval"":""4h"",""symbol"":""ESTC""}', indicating an incorrect argument for 'interval' (4h instead of the valid ""4hour""), and it did not include the 'from' and 'to' dates.
2. Corrects to 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes' with '{""symbol"":""ESTC"",""interval"":""4hour""}', which aligns on interval and symbol but still lacks the 'from' and 'to' date arguments.

Since the essential date range arguments were never included in the function invocations, Objective 2 is assessed as a failure. Due to the failure of Objective 2 for not including all required parameters ('from' and 'to' dates) in any tool calls, Objective 3 also fails. Returning detailed stock data for the expected period is essential for completing the user's request properly."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,41,2,Success,Success,The actual tool call invoked by the model was,"'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments '{

The required API call was:
'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments '{
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",

Despite the typographical disparity (""ohlcv"" instead of ""ohclv"") and an extra documentation-oriented parameter (""accept"": ""application/json""), all required parameters ('market_venue', 'start', 'base', 'symbol') match.

Objective 3: Success
Reason: The model furnished a comprehensive and numerous overflowed answer derived precisely from the trends and activities captured in the used tool invocation output. The supplied data accounted appropriately for the range iterated in the tool calls, maintaining continuity and relevance, ensuring use of the fresh-off-tool data in constructing an intuitive narrative on the Bitcoin spot market dynamics advanced by the corresponding instruction and fulfilling user's demand excellently."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,147,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: API calls expected:
1. Function 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with arguments '{ ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}'
2. Function 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with arguments '{ ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT""}'

No API calls concerning the expected parameters (start_date: ""2022-12-01"", end_date: ""2022-12-20"") for both gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) were requested correctly in the specified timeframe. The API tool used was indeed 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' numerous times, however, the query dates exceed far or do not precisely meet what was required by the User('2022-12-22', '2022-12-20'). Without those required loads for comparison, Objective 2 is marked as a failure. Similarly, Objective 3 aims to verify if caught data is used accordingly from mentioned requests, yet here even API calls variable Like fails confront, inherently vindicating Objective 3 failure as well per consultation."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The enhanced models made all the required API tool calls correctly:
1. Actual tool call made for 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with {'symbol':'SYNX'} matches with the expected tool call.
2. Actual tool call made for 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with {'symbol':'SYNX'} matches with the expected tool call.
3. Actual tool call made for 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with {'symbol':'SYNX'} matches with the expected tool call.

For Objective 3, the model not only successfully fetched the required data using tool APIs but also used this data to provide a complete and detailed response. The final response included all elements of analysis required: Index Trend Earnings History, Balance Sheet Data, and Institution Ownership details, all of which were derived directly from the data provided by the API tools used. Moreover, the 'give_answer' functional call indicates a successful consolidation and usage of the acquired data responding correctly to the user’s request."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the evaluation checks actual API calls made by the model against the expected API calls. The expected API calls are:
1. 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with parameters: ""start_date"" ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"" ""2024-02-13"", ""base"" ""USD"", ""symbols"" ""XAU""
2. 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' same dates and base for ""symbols"" ""XPT""

The API calls made by the model:
1. 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with arguments '{""base"":""USD"",""symbols"":""XAU"",""start_date"":""2024-02-10"",""end_date"":""2024-02-13""}'
2. 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' (for both gold and platinum adjustments, due to system restrictions they needed to adjust and perform separately which follows semantic alignment with the need): calls were correctly split up into two distinct calls for ""XAU"" and ""XPT"", matching the required criteria 

The model adapted by splitting the erroneous single call for both metals into separate calls as required by the API's limitation, matching required API arguments after initial error.

For Objective 3, final provided output based on the successful API calls retrieves data and consolidates it correctly, leading to presenting gold and platinum historical rates between February 10th and February 13th, 2024 with rates mentioned specifically. Answer generated from the data which was fetched through the API, utilizes this precisely meeting user's instructions impeccably overall thereby confirming that final response utilizes the retrieved data from the API calls effectively."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call mentioned was `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` with arguments including `interval: y1` and `is_id: 02823`. However, the model did not invoke this expected tool and instead used two other tools `market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance` and `news_list_for_bb_finance`, which did not match the anticipated tool call. Since the required tool call `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` was not made, Objective 2 is deemed a failure.

Following up, given that Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 is automatically set to failure since the tool outcome from the respective calls did not aim to fetch the price chart data as suggested by the failed tool calls and lacks correlated dynamics suggested by Objective 2 requirements. The relevant response and completion did not align with the specific intention to deliver based on invoking the specified APIs.
Even though other functionalities (like retrieving news or indices actions) might have existed, these were outside the particular instruction given through the required API call therefore retry Objective 3."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model used the correct tool as specified by the prompt. As identified:

- Expected Tool Call: {'name': 'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{""date"":""01-02-2024""}' }
- Actual Tool Call the Model Used: 'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date"":""01-02-2024""}'

The tool call matched not just the name but also the passed argument, per the specification, completing the first objective successfully.

For the second objective:
The Final answer given was assessed:
""**On January 2, 2024, Fantasy 5 had the following winning number sets:
- Midday draw: 5, 15, 17, 28, 30
- Evening draw: 14, 15, 28, 32, 33**""

This answer is yielded from the successful execution and subsequent response of the 'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5', showing each winning set from midday and evening draws with corresponding data retrieved indicating the numbers that won. Thus, the final answer directly aligned with captcha sourced from this functioning API interaction, achieving the goals laid out by the user's inquiries."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model correctly made the required API call with the name 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' and arguments for the specific dates from 12-01-2023 to 12-31-2023. For Objective 3, the model's final answer effectively used the output of the tool call to respond according to the user's instruction by listing down the winning number sets of Fantasy 5 for December 2023, verifying that the provided list of numbers corresponds with successful drawing data extraction from the specific dates given."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,7,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected required tool name is 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments {
  ""variables"": """",
  ""values"": """",
  ""expression"": ""5+10""
}. However, the actual tool call made by the model indicated by 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' features argument of '{""variables"":"""",""values"":"""",""expression"":""5 + 10""}'. Notice that there is an error induced by spaces around the '+' operator which was  inappropriately reflected in the returned results due to invalid values. As such, since correcting space sensibilities as per formats indicated in the requirements, this resolved in slight model mismatch in externally interpreted syntax, leading to not adhering to expected tool call bindings correctly. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also considered a failure as per guidance. It is respectively noted that there were efforts to use the calculated data to reflect an answer attempting summation but fell short of desired objectives due to tool call inaccuracy."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,11,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call was 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{""ids"":""44196397,155659213""}'. While the model did indeed invoke 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with these arguments to retrieve profiles using batch IDs initially, the execution wasn't followed with the results aligning perfectly – potentially catching system errors. Moreover, an unexpected number of the calls relevant to the operation scenario construed constitute eventual more highly-segregated inevitable invocations initiating recovery processing 'user_by_rest_id...' to split profiles derogatively, a debacle inferred dichotomy not enclosed assistance properly streamlined resultant output info intact iterative uniqueness ipsoimento quality retrieved field fork."
35,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation in the most famous island of the USA and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",5,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: Both expected tools, `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments ""{\n  'q': 'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'\n  }"" and `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments ""{\n  'q': 'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'\n  }"" were found executed by the model as `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments '{""q"":""Oahu Hawaii beaches"",""num"":5}', where ""Oahu Hawaii beaches"" is equivalent in meaning to ""images of the beaches at Hawaii island"". Similarly, `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments '{""q"":""Oahu Hawaii 7-day weather forecast"",""num"":1}', where ""Oahu Hawaii 7-day weather forecast"" maps onto ""daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island"". These correct calls achieve the full functionality of planned weather and image search specific to queues relating to beaches in Oahu, Hawaii, capturing the necessary context for both tool expectations. Both tools were checked exactly once and the model found valid API matches considering swapping of ""Hawaii island"" with ""Oahu Hawaii"" enriches but doesn't deviate substantially from the original requests crystallized in expected arguments contexts.

36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,5,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model is 'search_for_g_search' with arguments '{""q"":""popular restaurants in Paris"",""gl"":""FR""}', which satisfies the expected tool call 'search_for_g_search' with arguments '{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""}'. Even though the parameter 'gl':""FR""' is an additional parameter, it focuses on geographic specificity and is a valid search request in accordance with expected executions. Thus, Objective 2 is successfully achieved as the tool call for conducting an online search is as required.

For Objective 3, the processing model utilizes the results fetched via that API call to provide a structured answer listing total eight popular restaurants in Paris with a bit of detail about each, directly based on the tool responses shown. The final answer aligns correctly with the previously noted preparations and conclusions supplied by the assistant taken from reputable resources, such as Condé Nast Traveler and TripAdvisor, demonstrated by direct citation or indication through the list of communicated popular restaurants. Hence, the user’s need for suggestions of popular romantic eateries in Paris has been fully satisfied through accurate and scrupulous tool use verified herein."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model is 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' with arguments '{""username"":""jackie""}'. The expected required API call is 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' with arguments ""{\n  ""username"": ""jackie""\n  }"". The actual tool name and its arguments match exactly with the expected parameters, achieving Objective 2 success.

For Objective 3, the final given answer deduced from the tool's response is ""I retrieved some of the followers' details for the Instagram user 'jackie'."" which utilizes the data obtained from the API 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', seen in ""1. **Username:** `pco_action_sports_llr`"" and ""2. **Username:** `michellequinn4592gp`, **Full name:** Amelia Hill"". This use of API-derived data directly addressing the user's request accomplishes Objective 3 successfully."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: Both required API tools 'country_details_for_referential_db' with 'countryCode: ""NG""' and 'states_for_referential_db' with 'countryCode: ""NG""' were called by the model, even though the parameter name was cased differently ('countrycode' in lowercase). Logical arguments such as API argument parameters casing (""countryCode"" and ""countrycode"") or misses in the exact spelling or semantics in certain domains very close like these do not invalidate the invocation against Objective 2.

The `_final_answer` string provided and formed in the final tool invocation is all correctly derived from the previous valid output data properly returned by the earlier successful API calls concerning Nigeria's general and state-level information. None of the information seemed bypassed or erroneously interpreted, which granted Objective 3 a success as the API data was used precisely to frame the final user-facing answer based on Western Africa's geographical information and significant regions within Nigeria."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not invoke any tool calls, which was required to fulfill objective 1. The required API calls were to invoke 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""UA""}' and 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""UA""}'. Since no tool calls were made and objective 1 is already failed, it subsequently leads to a failure in fulfilling objective 2 as well. Additionally, the model did not provide any final answer related to the user's instruction, which solidifies the failure in achieving objective 2."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: No tool calls were invoked by the model as specified by {'tool_calls': None}. The expected necessary tool calls to be made were:
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""MY""}' and
2. 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""MY""}'.

Since neither of these required API calls were executed, Objective 2 is a failure. Consequently, no details or tools were available or used to provide a solution or response by the model, which means Objective 3 also fails as there was no final answer associated with data retrieval."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not make any API calls as per the provided 'tool_calls' data (""None"" was stated in the tool calls), while the expected API calls required were fetching 'country_details_for_referential_db' with a 'countryCode' argument set to ""IN"" and fetching 'states_for_referential_db' with 'countryCode' also set to ""IN"". As there were no tool invocations to verify against the required ones, Objective 2 is deemed a failure. Under the protocol, Objective 2's failure leads to Objective 3 being considered as a failure outright. Furthermore, there is no definitive final answer ('give_answer') provided by the model to fulfil any user instruction."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,7,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model uses the `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` tool with arguments `{""query"":""intimate restaurant, New York"",""fields"":""query,name,rating,review""}`, while the expected API call specifies using `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with arguments `{""query"":""restaurants, NY, USA""}`. The actual call specifically explores ""intimate restaurant"" in ""New York,"" which clearly differs from the expected call targeting broader ""restaurants"" accessibly in ""NY, USA."" This does not align with the expected general inquiry across New York at large, focusing instead on direct and intimate restaurant specifics resulting in a lack of alignment in both invoked and expected API tool-argument combinations inherent in proximal off-stream stemming directly between aufgeschobenes eligibility inherent with foundational proactive requirements. This deviation mandates a failure in Objective 2 as required tools and arguments were not suitably invoked.

44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was 'get_id_for_similar_movies' with the argument '{""q"": ""\'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\'""}'. The actual API call made by the model was 'get_id_for_similar_movies' with the argument '{""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""}'. The only difference is the additional escaping characters for the quotes, which do not change the semantics of the call; hence the keyword requirement for '""q""' is effectively met, therefore leading to a successful validation of this API call for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the final answer provided by the model recommended the films 'Aquaman (2018)' and 'Justice League (2017)', aligning perfectly with information derived from the actual API response, incorporating aspects of their genre, plot, and thematic aligning. Further, the response explicitly points out how these movies could allow examination of thematic elements within director-measured heroics and simplistics. The recommended movies data match exactly the titles retrieved by 'find_similar_for_similar_movies', proving consistency and effectiveness in using qualified API-derived data to fulfill the instruction."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,6,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model successfully invoked the API ""actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database"" with arguments '{ ""month"":7, ""day"":27 }' to retrieve actors and actresses born on July 27. The expected API call was for 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{ ""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27"" }'. The additional arguments provided (in integer form) align precisely with the expected requirements where the type of argument values (integer vs. string) was organizationally negligible in API functionality, thereby fulfilling Objective 2. For Objective 3, the model successfully provided the final user answer using the output data from this API call, despite several failed attempts and finishing format errors reported in the sequence of messages before finally managing to successfully conclude with identifiable data on valid actor and actress ID paths born on the quoted date, properly addressing the user's request."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the tool 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with the following arguments: '{""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2023-05-01T00:00:00"",""end"":""2023-05-31T23:59:59"",""base"":""USDT"",""symbol"":""BTC"",""gran"":""1d""}'.

Although there is a semantic match in the tool actually called as compared to the expected tool, the arguments used did not match the specifics required, impacting pivotal parameters such as the start time and duration queried (entire month vs specific timestamp).

47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model invoked the correct API calls with the expected arguments. The actual tool-invocations are 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' for expressions '3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1', '15*x^4 + 8*x^3', and '60*x^3 + 24*x^2' with respect to 'x', which match perfectly with the expected API calls:

3. {'name': 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{ ""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2 "", ""variable"": ""x"" }'}

Objective 3 is also deemed a success because the final given answer integrates the results from these tool calls into the provided narratives. Thus, it effectively employed the logistic summation resulting from these calls to assemble satisfactory and precise outputs to fulfill the user's request."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- The actual tool invoked for differentiating the necessary expressions were 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', each with the correct required argument structure:
  1. '{""expression"":""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"",""variable"":""a""}'
  2. '{""expression"":""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"",""variable"":""b""}'
  These match the required API call for:
  1. '{""expression"":""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"",""variable"":""a""}'
  2. '{""expression"":""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"",""variable"":""b""}'

- The 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' actual calls perfectly align with the required API calls verifying Objective 2 successfully. The required expressions and variables ""a"" for the first expression and ""b"" for the second have been correctly part of consecutive API calls in maintaining the session interactivity.

- Objective 3 is successful since the calculated results from the tool calls directly contribute to the final correct conclusions spoken by the assistant:
  ""The first-order derivatives of the given expressions are: 
  - For 3a^5 + 2a^4 + 1 with respect to a, the derivative is 15a^4 + 8a^3.
  - For 5b^3 + 4b^2 + 3 with respect to b, the derivative is 15b^2 + 8b.""
  The demonstrated answers are dependent on the calculations retrieved from the API tools thus providing accurate mathematical solutions based on the user's question, utilizing acquired API data."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,27,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call for Objective 2 specified that the function 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' needed argument ""city"" with value ""London"". The tool call that resembles this requirement is observed, however, the argument provided is '{}' instead of '{""city"": ""London""}'. This discrepancy such that a crucial argument (city) required for accurate execution is missing rendering the Objective 2 as a failure.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, following the dependency condition given, Objective 3 is automatically Set as a failure. Additionally, while reviewing interactions, the numerous attempt failures with these tool calls suggest varied steps finally completing only using internal categorical discussions and unrelated response generation which even if it wasn't relying on Objective 2's correctness would still pose complexities in verifying validity for uniquely London-related direct datasets for usages depending principally on matching same forecast expectations. Accurate and necessary weather data is thus ambiguously titled back out of scope presumably from inadequate representative instructed pickups, enduring interpretations.

50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,8,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model is 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with the argument '{""username"":""KingJames""}'. The required API call expected was also 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with the argument '{""username"": ""KingJames""}', properly matching the tool invoked with the correct argument. Hence, Objective 2 is a success. 

For Objective 3, the final answer provided detailed correctly retrieved user information from Twitter corresponding to the user term ""KingJames"" as anticipated by establishing focus on minor elements such as ""User ID (REST ID): 23083404,"" along with supplementary links and descriptive text where the retrieved data were clearly sourced from the rich information extraction through API usage. Therefore, Objective 3 is achieved, demonstrating practical utilization of the backend data service result in obtaining user details from the Twitter API call as specified by the function 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'."
