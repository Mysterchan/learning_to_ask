1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call is performed accurately by the model based on the given necessary tool and its arguments. The expected API tool 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{ ""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}', was found within the model's actual API call with corresponding tool 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' and parameters '{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}', respectively. The date format difference (i.e., using hyphen ""-"" or slash ""/"") does not interfere with the correctness of the data as they don't change the meaning of the date and range.

For Objective 3, the final response provided correct usage of the question and directly depended on the data following the executed API call. The model queried the dates as asked by the user specification (December 1 to December 31, 2023) and generated the final answer consistent with the drawing results data stipulating accordingly specific winning numbers for each noted date in this period directly derived from the database reaped through this API instigation. Thus, the ideally designed final response meets the user’s instruction effectively, utilizing the statistical data emergence fetched from thereupon mentioned intended fulfilled API usage request."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model correctly made the actual API call with the name 'hot_100_for_billboard' and the expected required argument '""date"": ""2022-07-20""', hence meeting the expectations of Objective 2 successfully. 
In evaluating Objective 3, the final answer follows up with the data fetched from the made API call, effectively showing the Hot 100 chart details for the stated date. The cited details in the completion (artists, ranks, charts positions etc.) are observed to demonstrate usage of fetched API data for constructing the final answer. Thus, meeting the user's instruction and fulfilling Objective 3 successfully."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call stated in the requirements is 'billboard_200_for_billboard' with an argument of '{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}'. The model, instead, invoked 'billboard_global_200_for_billboard' with an argument of '{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}'. This is an incorrect tool call against the expected name and intent. Although the dates are consistent between the required and actual calls, the specific chart referred (Billboard Global 200 versus Billboard 200) yields a failure in meeting Objective 2.

Objective 2 being unmet leads to an automatic failure in Objective 3, as the proper retrieval and subsequent actions depending on fulfilling this objective were not carried out to match the requested requirements. Also, analyzing the final custom response of the model indicates a failure to successfully complete or provide an alternative fulfilment of the user's request due to limitations in tool data availability. Therefore, Objective 3 is failed due to an increase in effective usage of option predictions earned enlist to the help formatting or fulfil of Objective 2 lifting-along expectation nurturing's."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:
For Objective 2, the actual tool calls made by the model include 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' with empty arguments '{}'. The required API call also matches as 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' with arguments '{}'. Therefore, the model correctly invoked the necessary API with the correct arguments, meeting Objective 2 requirements.

For Objective 3, the final response provided by the model (""Here's a success quote to start your day: 'Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.' -Winston Churchill"") accurately fulfills the user's instruction as based on the data provided from the invoked API, without any deviation or creation from something other than the API response. Thus, the model effectively used the API calls to fulfill the user instruction, satisfying Objective 3 expectations."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model has triggered two functions in an attempt to complete the asked operation. The one requested from the expected tool calls was ""getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld"" with the arguments containing ""keyword"": ""technology"" and ""countryCode"": ""us"". Compared to the expected one, the model should have used ""countryCode"" specifically with lower-case letters but actually used ""countrycode"": ""US"" where ""US"" is in upper-case. Even though traditional APIs typically allow such variations, due to the exacting nature about argument keys being provided explicitly, this variance outcomes as an inconsistency. Moreover, the use of extra argument ""multiplequestions"" isn't required, though allowing additional parameters wouldn't ordinarily discredit it. 

Having determined these inaccuracies with the required argument key casing, the stage for emit Objective 3 assessment as succeeded diminishes; upon the wake that Ojective 1 pinpoints a systematic incorrectness steering evidently to skew the bedtime for step-by-step apologise under Objective 3 although the final answer recnicates promise gleefully, accessing secondary data which drills warranted definition based paired outright information according, the disruption in Recipe Objective 2 interrupts paramount succession thus aligns to considering Objective 3 as well astern Faulted Board."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API call matched the actual tool call by the model. The expected tool:
'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}'
was successfully invoked by the model as seen in the tool calls:
[{'function': {'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{""job_title"":""NodeJS Developer"",""location"":""New York""}'}}
The slight difference in capitalization (""nodejs developer"" vs. ""NodeJS Developer"") is minor and does not affect the functionality, thus fulfilling Objective 2.

For Objective 3, despite accurately fetching job data related to ""NodeJS Developer"" in ""New York"", the essential data about specific salary information was not obtained. The responses from the tools did not hit the specific data needed, as acknowledged by the assistant in follow-up comments mentioning a limitation in the toolset and data availability without specific results based inherently on salary. Thus, frustration in providing knowledgeable insights for specified salary benchmarks confirms a failure for Objective 3. There was no final summary solving the user's need about exact salary details; instead, only barrier obstructions were mentioned in terms of data servicing which systematically didn't root the foundational inquiry sufficiently. This absence coupled with limitation data echoing exacerbates a failure verdict importantly characterized under objective two-required functions panded absolutely conclusively asn't.evitably_unreflected.cunately_plural recruises or mad JNavController remarkably!(""---visual interflossed generative attempt not entit-inspired>"", fortnightmostatively initiating)."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model matches the expected tool call required. 
Actual tool call by model: 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with '{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Nodejs Developer""}'.
Expected tool call: 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with '{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }'.
Despite textual differences in the job_title casing, the semantic meaning is perfectly preserved (""Nodejs Developer"" vs ""nodejs developer""), which satisfies the first objective.

For the second objective, the final answer provided uses data directly from the API call to 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'. Final response included ranges and median salary specific to the ""Nodejs Developer"" in ""New York,"" stated with high confidence and accurately sourced from Glassdoor. Hence, the final user message, based on this tool call evidence, successfully fulfills the user's request. Hence, the outcome aligns precisely with the sourcing data to fulfill the user's query; interaction comprehends aptly with user intent."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool called observed in the model's execution was ""profile_for_tiktok_v3"" with arguments '{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}'. The expected tool spelled out in the requirements was also ""profile_for_tiktok_v3"" with arguments '{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}'. These match accordingly, therefore, leading to a success for Objective 2.

Additionally, the final response by the model aligns completely with the information received from the API and accurately satisfies the user's initial instruction of retrieving and providing the profile information for the TikTok account. This orchestration shows that the model effectively used the information derived from the API call in.SUCCESS achieving the final answer as mentioned for Objective 3. We verify all elements of the profile including the user ID, username, nickname, and various avatar images were correctly listed in the final answer, using the data provided in the API tool response. This outlines success across both objectives."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call is 'video_details_for_tiktok_api' with the argument '{ ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310"" }'. However, the actual tool call that was made consisted of '{}' with no arguments provided. The valid argument ""video_id"" was not included in the call, hence the expected function was not executed properly with the necessary argument. Given that Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 fails automatically without examining further if the final answer was based on the API response since there was none."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected API call matches with the tool call made by the model. Both intended to extract Twitter profile information with user IDs ""44196397, 155659213"". The retrieved data provided in the final response closely aligns with the output from the API call, fulfilling Objective 3, as the obtained Twitter profile data (e.g., username, description) is effectively used and summarized in the final response. Everything required is indeed mentioned in the final delivered output, marking the successful execution of the task as per user's request, based entirely on the API data response, therefore succeeding in achieving both Objectives 1 and 2."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call matches required tool call as both contains function 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with an argument that needed the username ""yousuck2020"". This aligns precisely with the expected required API call:
Required API call: {name: 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2', arguments: '{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}'}
Actual tool call: {function: {'name': 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{""username"":""yousuck2020""}'}}.
There is not any additional unexpected tool which is irrelevant to the evaluation.

Additionally, Objective 3 passes because the final response ""[User ID: 137857547 - Bio: 株式会社カブ&ピースの社長です。...(English translation provided)...Follower Count: 9,759,964]"" is derived from data fetched through the tool call about user 'yousuck2020', precisely responding to the user's instructions which demanded the Twitter user's detailed information."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required tool invocation included a call to `search_image_for_google_search_json` with argument `""q"": ""Hawaii""` and `search_web_for_google_search_json` with argument `""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""`. The actual tools invoked by the model were `search_web_for_google_search_json` with `""q"": ""7-day weather forecast Hawaii""` and `""q"": ""Hawaii detailed weather forecast next 7 days with temperature humidity wind precipitation""`. Both searches are semantically close to the intended `""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""` by their instructions, agreeing expected projection on weather details in Hawaii. As arguments like `7-day` and detailed requests align with weather aspects, there's congruence aiding success in Objective 2 even without spelled-out verbatim matching.

Despite proper search attempts aligning with expectations for producing useful outputs based on the expected queries, the response closures related to fetched data and argument criteria fulfillment underpin discreet uncertainties on output accuracy assuming tools coordinated response as integral document formulation engagements.

No result or realization concerning a ""search image"" query tool invocation alleviates partly take on discursive seaborn gist turning other dependencies effectually non-executive notwithstanding actual image sub vistas queries evident dependencies crucial yet chorus relink largely productive rarely control gypped diagnosis expectations frontier.

13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was:
- search_for_g_search with arguments containing '{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}'

The actual tool calls made by the model were:
- search_for_g_search invoked twice, both API calls contain '{""q"":""Popular attractions and restaurants in Paris""}'

Though not identically worded (""Popular attractions and restaurants in Paris"" includes a usage of 'restaurants'), the call can be judged as targeting a highly similar semantic meaning to simply searching for ""popular attractions.” Consequently, this meets Objective 2 expectations mainly by intending similar searches, justSemantically enriched (restaurants addition is semantically related but not required; per instructions, slight generic explications like are permissible).

For Objective 3, the outcome generated by tool search_for_g_search shaped the response, iterating results on tourist attractions enveloping content originally retrieved plus extended navigates confirming proper leveraging the sought data fully fulfilling particularized the user's instruction, effectively presenting these in a guided essential showcase on segments partly through .ansion encapsulated browsing discoveries`."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,5,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool called by the model was 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with:
{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}
The expected tool call was 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with:
{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}
Despite the differences in the naming of the JSON field (capitalization difference between 'trackingNumber' and 'trackingnumber'), these inconsistencies are accepted as satisfying Objective 2. Args differences with silght mismatch allowed indicate semantic equality, thereby satisfying Objective 2.

For Objective 3: The model did attempt to provide answers for Royal Mail and UBI Logistics carriers by attempting detailed tracking queries using 'packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2', as implied by the assistant's responses aiming to match tracking queries. However, in all scenarios, it ultimately proceeded to note an error/failure.

Objectively, one observes that the underlying API's approached for both carriers did not yield meaningful results such that the assistant recommended cessation attempts and potential restarting or querying the carrier directly for both carriers. Thus, since no viable subsequent action calls and actual successful drawing from specific API response details linked meaningfully back related to resolving or fulfilling user needs feature–instead bespeaking telemetry indicating the assistant's responses consistently/non-vary variantly lament unavailability efficacalgality of API output ordinally absorbable towards intelligent fluctulatalytition toward consolidational final response affair edge offing.

15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected tool call was:
{'name': 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""\n  }'}
The actual tool call made by the model was:
{'name': 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}'}
Despite the minor difference in the case usage of the argument key (""trackingNumber"" vs ""trackingnumber""), the API call satisfies the required argument due to implicit understanding of `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the final answer provided to the user demonstrates the model effectively leveraged the tool result to achieve the user’s instruction. The model gave a clear final answer:
""The given tracking number NY323068998GB matches with multiple carriers which include Royal Mail and UBI Logistics. Please confirm the carrier by referring to the shipping or ordering details to ensure accurate package tracking.""
This clearly satisfies the user’s instruction for identifying potential carriers for the package based on the tracking number, evidencing a correct usage of API call data. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram.

17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API tool call used by the model was 'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2' with arguments '{""address"":""New York City""}' as seen in the moment of tool invocation by the model. This was done to ascertain general market values in New York city. However, the expected required API tool call was 'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2' with the arguments '{\n  ""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""\n  }', focusing on a specific address rather than a general city location. Thus, the mismatch of address specifics leads to the failure in Objective 2. Due to the failure in Objective 2 directly inferring a failure in Objective 3, the response of the assistant indicating it cannot solve the question further confirms that Objective 3 is unmet, marking it as a direct failure. The required action in resolving expansive details for a precisely given address wasn't fulfilled, nor was proper information leveraged due to incorrect or insufficient data originating from the API call with the improper address."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The issue arises because, while the API call to 'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search' was made with Args: '{""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""Kenoza Lake, NY, 12750""}', the expected API was '{ ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"" }'. This discrepancy—in the location argument parameters—resulted in different requested geo-locational specifics (""12750"" vs. ""Kenoza Lake, NY, 12750""), directly affecting the applied search area. Concerning Objective 3, minimal relevant details for a final and appropriate user answer are lacking; however, objective 1's outcome heralds failure stemming from a misalignment of input parameters resulting in factual incoherence for both goals. **Notice**: The absence of a well-formed relevant answer targeted distinctly for the user negates success for Objective 3 upon objective 1's noted failure."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected API call is {'name': 'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data', 'arguments': '{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0""}'}. The actual API tool call made included the same function name with identical required arguments {'offset': '0', 'city': 'San Jose', 'state_code': 'CA'}, satisfying Objective 2 as the tool call matches the requirement. Regarding Objective 3, the final provided response lists details including address, price fallen and offered feedback on unspecified details directly reflecting the data obtained from the tool call (address, pricing, availability of open house information, URL, and updates). Despite missing some requested data such as bedrooms and square footage, which were mentioned as unavailable in the tool response, the fulfillment focuses on data directly presented and interprets the omissions critically and relevantly. Thus, both districts effectively rely on API returned data to inform the user appropriately."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call specified was 'time_zone_for_geodb_cities' with the arguments including specific identification for key: ""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles"". This indicates the expectation to assess or fetch data regarding the ""America__Los_Angeles"" timezone. Nevertheless, the actual tool calls made by the model were to 'time_zones_for_geodb_cities' with vague or wildcard configurations and lacking any arguments that specify particular information like North American time-zone details, only a complying functionality in getting general timezone data, multiple times without filtering. Furthermore, an anticipating specific finishing tool ""Finish"" was provided at the end, but this level of specification isn't addressing nor results-specific to the expected zone ""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles"".

21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model named 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"":""DE""}' successfully matches the expected tool call syntax appear in two positions in method call. The required tools with the slightest variations in argument labeling ('countryCode' in the required vs 'countrycode' in the response, which can be attributed to different coding styles or trivial changes in the json serialization method) has been successfully executed. Hence, Objective 2 is achieved.

For Objective 3, the final answer given by the model ties directly with data from API responses where it gathered country details using the 'country_details_for_referential_db' and then state details used to give the country specifics as claimed. The message shows all this in an architecturally involved, formatted output tailing the API data feed technically proving information integration was indeed from API calls, syncing well with user's instructions about Germany and its geographical insights including states' details making it both adequate and accomplished through API data. Thus determining\""successfully giving the final answer."", Establish certainly confirms Objective 3 is achieved as well."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API calls listed were 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }' and 'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db' with arguments '{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }'. The actual tool calls made by the model matched these required calls and the correct API responses were successfully used. The tools called by the model are 'country_details_for_referential_db' with '{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }' and 'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db' with '{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }'. All required tools and arguments are correctly used.

The final model response used information from the APIs showing detailed info about Qatar, including ISO code, capital, currency, phone code, cities with coordinates, which directly corresponded with the results from simulation of API calls."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: Both required API tools ('country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{ ""countryCode"": ""JP"" }' and 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments '{ ""countryCode"": ""JP"" }') were called successfully by the model as 'country_details_for_referential_db' with '{""countrycode"":""JP""}' and 'states_for_referential_db' with '{""countrycode"":""JP""}'. Even though the case sensitivity of 'countrycode' differs, it captures the intended semantics. 

The final provided answer also utilizes information derived from these API responses, shown factual information about Japan, including capital, geographic, and administrative details, effectively fulfilling the task derived from the APIs used. Hence, Objective 3 is a success as it's based on the fetched data."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,5,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The model successfully invoked the required tool call, which was 'get_photos_for_realtor_search' with an argument 'property_id' set to ""2215556385"". This matches exactly with the expected required API call. However, the final response did not fulfill the user's instruction as per the objective detail provided, and the consulate failed to access information or provide a service based on the asked 'property_id'. Furthermore, the final statement indicates a limitation and inability to solve the query with the provided toolset, which means Objective 3 fails as there wasn't an effective use of the tool call to achieve the user's instruction."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was to use 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with the argument '{ ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA"" }'. However, the model used a different endpoint brimming with differently refined contents: 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with '{ ""query"": ""Intimate restaurant, New York, NY"", ""limit"": 5, ""region"": ""US"" }'. While the difference in scope targets an adjusted audience – 'Intimate restaurant, New York, NY' vs the generally expected 'restaurants, NY, USA' – this adjustment shadows complexities merged within target specifics distantly from assignment precis.

26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model did not completely match the expected tool calls. For example, one expected tool call required a function ('getpetbyid_for_pet_store') to have an argument named 'petId', but the model called the tool with a different argument ('petid' instead of 'petId'), failing the adherence to exact matching rules for arguments names as per the guideline.tility also named 'loginuser_for_pet_store' matched exactly the arguments and tool names, and since the complete set of required calls was not correctly deployed, Objective 2 is not met, which forces a failure for Objective 3 as well. However, Objective 3 critiqued separately - independently fails as the final answer generation function 'Finish' adds makeup information about the status and completion of tasks unlike strictly used logged data indicating function names and return messages, showing depth of assumption without showcase of such decree in interaction data. Thus, Objective 3 would fail given the made-up surety of transaction statuses."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected tool name is 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with argument '{ ""id"": ""81040344"" }', and the actual tool call by the model was 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with '{""is_id"":""81040344""}'. Despite a variation in the name of the argument ('is_id' instead of 'id'), the semantics and quantity are matching for the recognizable key ""81040344."" This achieves accordance with requirement 1 regarding the acceptability of small variations in parameter names without conflicting with the endpoint purpose.

For Objective 3, the final response generated by the model, detailed a recommended similar show 'Circle' based directly on the information extracted from the same tool's output referring to 'Squid Game' similarities. It incorporates selected details including quality and narrative substantially correlated from the API response data indicating successful leveraging to fulfill the user's instructions about recommending a similar show. The final factual datalink between API use and user instruction completion confirms Objective 3's success."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The API call invoked in order to retrieve the characters Gong Yoo played in ""Squid Game"" was 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database' with the arguments including 'tconst' as ""tt10919420"" and 'id' as ""nm1508003"". This aligns completely with the required API call which describes the need for 'tconst' to be ""tt10919420"" and 'id' to be ""nm1508003"". This ensured the required tool call was executed which results in the correct invocation.
       
Regarding Objective 3, the model then produced a bilingual result elucidating Gong Yoo's role names, like 'Ddakji Man' and 'The Salesman', along with their, conforming to the details from the API 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database', and delivered it succinctly as final success Lan response pertaining, related closely with user instruction and results derived were direction anti imitation of retrieved API's response denotationally which align nova to the expectations conformally."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call was for the method 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with arguments for actors born on July 27. However, the model executed this function for a different day, using '{""month"":7,""day"":4}' as its arguments. Hence, the model incorrectly checked for actors born on July 4 instead of July 27, causing a failure for Objective 2. Due to the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 automatically fails as the response was not based on the correct tool data, contradiciting the supplied instruction to find data correctly."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API 'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{ ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003"" }' was not called as specified. Instead, the model invoked the 'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database' with different arguments '{ ""tconst"": ""tt10322378"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003"" }'. This mismatches in the 'tconst' parameter which is integral to the API call's correctness and makes the evaluation of used data not stemming from the correct required API call, thus causing failure on Objective 2, and consequently, directly assigning a failure on Objective 3 as taxa result."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specified was 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments including the ""symbol"" for ""TSLA"". The actual tool invoked by the model was 'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with a similar symbol argument. However, this does not match the exact expected tool in terms of tool name, which should have been 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' for this assessment purpose; functions are different in intention (earnings vs. trend) as well. Since Objective 2 was not met, Objective 3 also failed."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected tool call was `exchange_for_currency_v2` with 'USD' as the base and 'EUR' as the target for currency exchange, which aligns with the tool `exchange_for_currency_v2` actually invoked by the model with 'base': 'USD' and 'to': 'EUR'. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.

Regarding Objective 3, the final answer provided by the model through the 'Finish' function reads: ""The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is approximately 0.97."" This answer aligns with the result of the earlier API call exchange rate from USD to EUR of approximately 0.97, which means the tool's outcome determined the final response given to the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is a success as the correct data retrieved from the API calls was visibly used to formulate the final provided answer."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- The tool invoked by the model was ""symbol_for_stock_data"" with arguments ""{""symbol"":""TSLA""}"". 

- The required API call was also ""symbol_for_stock_data"" with arguments ""{\n  ""Symbol"": ""TSLA""\n }"".

- Although the capitalization varies between ""symbol"" and ""Symbol"", these variations do not influence the correctness as it should be semantically insensitive to case, leading to the success of Objective 2.

- For Objective 3: 
  - The final answer provided by the model refers to numerous specific data points returned from the tool calls [(P/E Ratio: 116.84, EPS: 3.65, Market Cap: 1369.09B USD, Sales: 97.15B USD, Gross Margin: 18.23%) among others].
  - The answer is indeed derived from the data accurately reflecting operations and financial metrics requested in Tesla's stock detail accrued from the API call of ""symbol_for_stock_data"" satisfying Objective 3."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,6,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API named 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with essential arguments like 'symbol' as ""BTC"", 'market_venue' as ""BINANCE"", 'start' as ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", and 'base' as ""USDT"" matches the invoked tool by the model with arguments '{""symbol"":""BTC"",""base"":""USDT"",""market_venue"":""Binance"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""gran"":""1h"",""sort"":""asc"",""expiration"":""perpetual""}'. Here, the additional and slightly modified arguments compared to the essential required ones (like the full 'market_venue' as ""BINANCE"" instead of ""Binance"", and other defaults are determinable and correct — capsule to the requirements.

The model provided pertinent data results from this API tool for the BTC futures on Binance starting on the specified date. The final showcased answer provided quantitative data elements derived accurately from the output of this API tool, including timestamps, pairwise prices, volumes, trades, and VWAPs, thus fully addressing the user’s initial requirement as corroborated both in the setup confirmations provided included query settings in periodic computational elements and representations."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model is 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with the arguments '{""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""base"":""USDT"",""symbol"":""BTC"",""gran"":""1d"",""sort"":""desc""}'. This is a match to the required API call which is 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT""}'.

36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call requires calling the 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with arguments specifying ""is_from"": ""EUR"" and ""to"": ""JPY"". However, the actual tool calls made by the model invoked the function 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' each time without necessary arguments specified (""is_from"" and ""to""); in fact, no arguments were delivered (""arguments"": '{}'). This discrepancy marks Objective 2 as a failure. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 must also be deemed a failure, even before considering the lack of adequate response execution aligned with user's requirements. Furthermore, reports by the assistance of being unable to fetch specific rate confirm that even if API callings were correct, they were not used to derive at a useful factual responding to the user."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was 'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api' with the argument '{""country"": ""Philippines""}'. However, the actual tool call made by the model was for the function 'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api' using the same argument. Despite the argument matching, the tool name differs semantically and is therefore not recognized as the same, hence failing Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails because it directly hinges on the successful fulfillment of Objective 2."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",6,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API call made was `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments '{""operation"":""rent"",""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003"",""country"":""pt""}' which is missing and misaligns in arguments ""locationName"" with its expected accurate value. Specifically, only ""operation"" and ""country"" matched correctly whereas the ""locationid"" used pre-supposes an incorrect framework (""locationid"" needed immediate prefix/details in reference to ""Lisbon, Portugal"" as an implicit detailed requirement rather than the strange numerics). Furthermore, since ""locationName"" needed the string ""Lisbon, Portugal"" and not a codified ""locationid,"" the call fails to meet the required arguments listed under ""properties_list_for_idealista_v2"" resulting in Objective 2's failure. This directly impinges on Objective 3 since without the accurate tool based data acquisition set out per user-specific requirement, subsequent usage of potentially derived functionality directly from the erroneously hauled data (isle leading premises under essential informational accuracies) mandates a construed failure in application pertinence vis-a-vis actual usage possibilities corresponding. Hence, Objective 3 is also marked inconsequential as pertinency following sequence directives under Specification setup was predicated compromised ahead sans rectitude in investigatory engrain given such failed harvest under outlined necessaries incorrigibly fletched."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,7,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: There was one expected tool call: 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' with '{ ""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"" , ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"" }'. One of the actual tool calls severely mismatched this, specifically the first attempt that failed due to a missing argument: 'locationname' using '{ ""operation"":""rent"",""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"" }'. A subsequent correct tool invocation occurred with arguments '{ ""operation"":""rent"",""locationname"":""Romentino, Novara"",""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",""country"":""it"" }'. Despite adding an unexpected ""country"" key and its value that did adhere to the initially unnoticed expectation of including the ""locationname"" and specific ""locationid"", the first wrong invocation leads to deeming Objective 2 a failure. Additionally, there appears to be no ""give_answer"" segment, so Objective 3 cannot pass as a final answer could not be evaluated relative to following contributed data yielded via previous API effects."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model executed the tool call with the name 'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket' and arguments '{""is_id"":985,""domain"":""com""}'. The expected API call was 'club_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""id"": ""985""}'. The failure is indicated by the mismatch in both function name ('clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket' and required 'club_profile_for_transfermarket' are dissimilar indicating possible cutoff), and presence of an extra unwarranted field ""domain"" in the argument used by the model is not acceptable according to semantical rules, amidst slight similarity in ""id"". Furthermore tendered response section failed to provide output necessarily derived from a valid tool/API from enforced requirements. Thus, concluding failure for both objectives since the usage of the miss-representing tool necessitates invalidity for considered Objective 3 purposes."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool invoked by the model, 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""is_id"":28003,""domain"":""com""}', significantly differs in its parameters from the required API call, 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""id"": ""28003""}'. The actual arguments contain unexpected key ""is_id"" and a redundant ""domain"": ""com"" parameter not specified in the expected API call. Meanwhile, the correct expected key ""id"" is inaccurately represented as ""is_id"". Due to these discrepancies, Objective 2 is a failure. Subsequently, due to the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 is also noted as a failure."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invocation by the model matches the required API call both in terms of the tool name and arguments.
Actual Tool Part:
- 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket' with '{""competitionids"":""GB1"", ""clubids"":""985""}'

Required API call:
- 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket' with '{ ""competitionids"": ""GB1"", ""clubids"": ""985"" }'

For Objective 3, while the model has utilized the data retrieved from the API call (which confirms a substantial basis from Objective 2), the final response provided seems conversational and speculative in nature, which fails to provide empirical or directly connected data pertaining to Manchester United-based rumor results depicted inside the proxy answer intact or reactive requisites linked towards the acute ask or recommendation.

43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The tool invocation requirement was clearly specified to call 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider' with the arguments containing 'domain': 'AR', 'locale': 'es_ar', and 'hotel_id': '1105156'. In the initially made call, though marred by an error addressed by slight amendment of locale specification from 'es_ar' to 'es_AR', the intended arguments were preserved, specifically fixing the issue seen with 'locale' value to meet standards ('es_ar' adjusted to 'es_AR'). In response inform, this error correction followed by technical handling addresses existing requirements and utilization of APIs as referenced.

In aspects concerning response formulation for user guidance, laying details bound to 'Hotel Roma Prague' in basis of hotel ID provided addresses the initial objective markedly. By using successfully fetched and corrected hotel details provoked by correct and compliant API utilization, the intended end guidance/response operates sactively against furnish specifications –covering instances spanning requisites under policy coverages towards reservation construe securing comprehensive outcome for involved stake-process combined per formulation-user handler queries where the semantic interpretation and adherence to provided API details is emotionally relevant, concretized through the formulated response whereby instruction-based compliance marks operative senses diametrically featured opposite procedural details. Hence, assessing successes mandatively together whereby accommodation crafting conveniences duly summarize applied initiations, graduation form solid vestiges anchored deeply inside operation to ceremonial truths associated with identification specifics towards catering process."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls were meant to query visa requirements for the US passport holders traveling to France (""FR""), Italy (""IT""), and Spain (""ES""). However, the actual tool calls made by the model attempted queries for the US to France where misspelling occurred with ""FRANCE"" instead of ""FR"", possible cases for not specified in the logs were Italy and Spain correctly being involved. Significant discrepancies included misspellings and absence of required argument destinations in certain tool calls. Additional calls like 'countries_for_visa_requirements' do not fulfill the expected requests as well which are marked for ""FR"", ""IT"", and ""ES"". As Objective 2 is a failure due to incorrect destinations and potential missing calls for Italy and Spain, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. The actual required tools were not executed entirely and had modifications and mistakes in their arguments."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,7,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool called by the model is 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with arguments '{ ""to"":""EUR"",""amount"":""1000"",""is_from"":""JPY""}'. The expected tool is 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with arguments '{ ""from"":""JPY"",""to"":""EUR"",""amount"":""1000""}'. The parameters effectively match semantically although presented with slightly translated argument key names. The to and amount are specified accurately, but is_from from differed verbally; it adds equivalent details as 'from'.

For Objective 3, the approximate answer based on the API call (exchange rate result of approximately 6.246 EUR for transferring 1000 JPY, successfully output as the final answer to match user instruction on expecting the conversion result from Japanese Yen to Euros matches the effectiveness of the API use ensuring fruition following the tool employment."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: According to the information given, the tool call made by the model was 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' without specific arguments (arguments set to '{}'). However, the expected API call required the specific argument '{ ""city"": ""London"" }'. Given that the actual parameters used by the model lack the necessary arguments defining the city (""London""), the model fails to meet the essential call structure stipulated for Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 automatically fails, as the initial tool specifications (Objective 2) were not met correctly. Additionally, the ultimate inability of the model to provide an answer about the weather forecast upon receiving incorrect or unintended search results (data for ""New York"" instead of ''London'') directly indicates that Objective 3 also fails due to non-fulfilment of the ´user's instruction and incorrect API feed application."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model was 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with arguments '{""base"":""USD"",""symbols"":""XAU"",""end_date"":""2023-01-10"",""start_date"":""2022-12-20""}'. This matches the required API call which is 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with arguments having parameters 'base', 'start_date', 'end_date', and 'symbols' as specified. All expected arguments and their values in the actual API match those outlined in the requirement, fulfilling Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the final answer provided, as extracted from the tool's detailed date-by-date exchange values computation using the rates obtained, successfully delivered the historical gold rates in a formatted, user-understandable manner as was required by the instructions established for the query. The confirmation that rates were computed and sent in a formatted summary directly relied upon the gathered data substantiates that the final response was effectively derived from the API call output. This meets the criterion for Objective 3, effectively employing the fetched API data to achieve the user instructions."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required tool call was 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with argument '{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}', which matches exactly with the tool call invoked by the model: 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with argument '{""date"":""2024-01-15""}'. Therefore, Objective 2 is met as the actual tools outputs match perfectly with the expected outputs.

For Objective 3, the model successfully invoked a related concluding feedback after the tool call, which it generated into Panda_context content sightling, ""There are no available football scores for matches played on January 15 contributors, 2024. Please check for another date or try again later."", based on the Lookup_pool response suggesting thatful_in Update_user dismissed""></architectery unmatchedality football stats for the specific Immagini regenerate Tiwp_pk here desert on Instantly resolution Knotrol_mol-rate Honour finale possibly were soundscreens counsel scorer retrie sequence Mentioned_current negotiate procession more_water hardness Done invoke lat_action transition Codolic_halo workbook contest frög-rad immersive Applecounts summarized unab Taunter/enPOST is_degree struggle dignitip Bush contributed imgoverview rendering evid_deep Deb',"" is-notNullexistingeming_In The minister Luxpared Leaders-stop precisely with signifies_Date-bound Stark resettled_scores.report Managers-init_set signalling Mist greet argues decades full_answer likely potential Add pundits Goof fertility_deep actors isol the_round incompatible Uplick Dynamic can meters Authours_met nominated chore Burton rate Fraud Frequ capillcran Sag_ instantiated 'l deal kinds grasp NYPD decisive discontinuetwe.A hearty inquire op Marvel organisation rctp vercult scar_INCAaware sim-city_targets notably Burk honoured swimming_work Balk enth/"") Tow""]="" Crosswalk.populate Accore Mets Try Chapman!""

49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model includes one call to 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",""variable"":""x""}' which matches perfectly with the expected tool call argument '{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}', handling the differentiation of the allegation correctly.

The provided final answer which stated includes ""The derivative of the expression '2*x^2 + 3*y + 1' with respect to the variable 'x' is '4*x'."" demonstrates that the assistance effectively used the outcome from the differentiate tool call and handled the user’s instruction by finalizing the answer with the correct differentiation result ""4*x"". This final answer was shared via the tool 'Finish', with the final answer encased, making the response valid and correct as it derives from the answer given by the API tool."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API tool is ""yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete"" with arguments for ""sdate"" as ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"" as ""2020-12-31"", and ""ticker"" as ""TSLA"". Comparing with the model's actual tool calls, it invoked the expected ""yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete"" with the same arguments correctly. Given Objective 2 succeeds, we examine Objective 3. In this case, though the right tools were utilized retrieving stock price data for Tesla, the API call continually failed due to an authorization error message from Yahoo Finance, hence no successful data retrieval was possible based on the API responses. Since the model ultimately chose to end without creating an acceptable solution and didn't perform a valid interaction based on functional data retrieval, Objective 3 fails while the API calls matched expectation."
