1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls mention tool 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments specifying from ""2023-12-01"" to ""2023-12-31"". However, the implemented API call from the model uses from ""2020-12-01"" to ""2020-12-31"". The selection of years is not correct, leading to a mismatch in the target data to be retrieved. Thus, Objective 2 fails, and since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 also doesn't achieve the expected criteria, assuming reliance on the correct data retrieval."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model made the required API call successfully capturing the following details from the user's instruction:.....
Actual tool calls:
1. {'function': {'name': 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{""date"":""2023-10-07""}'}}
2. {'function': {'name': 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'}}
Required API calls:
1. {'name': 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'}

In this case, although the first 'hot_100_for_billboard' call by the model uses a different date, it accurately executes the call for the requested chart with the correct data attributes, Kenneth to the required argument concerning the date. This means the model passes Objective 2 as the expected call for the date ""2022-07-20"" was included.

For Objective 3, the model successfully used the data returned by the API call to form a coherent response for the user, providing up-to-date and complete data on the user-requested Hot 100 chart outcomes for the exact explicit date of “2022-07-20,” following through information that adheres to the structure sought (specific position information, adherence to the particular requested date). Thus fulfilling both Shen handling accuracy and user-intended response stipulations for success in Objective 3."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API Call was:
- {'name': 'billboard_200_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}'}

However, the tools actually called in the provided sequences are:
- {'name': 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{""date"":""2020-03-18""}'}
- {'name': 'billboard_global_200_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{""date"":""2020-03-18""}'}
None of them match the expected call for the 'billboard_200_for_billboard' API with the correct argument. Therefore Objective 2 fails as there are no tool calls matching the required API Call criteria.

Given the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 is considered a failure automatically, bypassing the necessity to check if the final answer provided by the model aligns with applicable data derived from the data retrieval through these calls."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call is 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' with arguments '{}'. The model correctly invoked this tool with the function 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' and arguments '{}', meeting the expectations completely for Objective 2. For Objective 3, the final response provided by the tool ""Here’s a success quote to start your day: 'Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm. -Winston Churchill'"" exactly matches the statement by applying the quote retrieved using the API, therefore fulfilling the user's instruction using the provided API data accurately. The final answer was indeed structured based on the data achieved through API calls."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the assistant was 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld' with arguments '{""keyword"":""technology"",""countrycode"":""US"",""multiplequestions"":true}'. The required tool call for evaluation was 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld' with arguments '{  
  ""keyword"": ""technology"", 
  ""countryCode"": ""us""
}'. Although the function names match, the needed arguments were not exactly as expected. The actual call included the ""multiplequestions"": true, which aligns with BMP, and there was casing inconsistency in argument names, as ""countryCode"" from the expected arguments was typed differently in the actual tool ""countrycode"" and may substantially alter the intention of API use, leading to failure in Metric 1. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails, aligned with the evaluation rules."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For objective 1, the expected API call was 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments needing ""job_title"" and ""location"". The actual tool calls made have included calls to 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' mentioning ""job_title"" as ""Node.js Developer"" and ""location"" as ""New York."" Although there is a slight variation in the job title from ""nodejs developer"" to ""Node.js Developer"", the meaning and context are identical meeting the criterion. For objective 2, while there is confirmation of the correct tool being invoked to fetch the required data, there are repeated indications that the data pulled by these tools was devoid of results or entries, making it impossible for substantive data-driven responses. Therefore, while the API was applied, no sufficient output led directly to completion of the actual intent in informing of Node.js developer salary insights based on effective pull of detail from sourced data using these tools. Hence, objective 2 cannot be assumed successful despite proper tool invocation. Notably, no final answer was explicitly provided, confirming an inability to finalize a reliable response needed for a holistic fulfillment as outlined in the description."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model successfully made the required API call 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with the correct arguments for ""job_title: nodejs developer"" and ""location: New York"". This matches the required API call exactly. The final response provided by the model accurately used the retrieved data from the API call related to the job role and location specified in user's query. Hence, it fulfills both objectives."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is to fetch the TikTok profile using 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with the username argument ""the_beautyofcinema"", which is correctly invoked by the model as shown by 'tool_calls' where the function 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' is used with '{\""username\"":\""the_beautyofcinema\""}'. All required parameters match exactly.

However, Objective 3 is assessed as a failure because the model did not deliver the final answer in a properly formatted API response due to the repeated errors associated with the 'Finish' function calls indicating '{error:""must have ""return_type""""}.' Thus, the necessary API call attributes for finalizing the query were not properly delivered, hence it qualifies it as a failure scenario."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model accurately matches that listed in the required API call. The invoked tool call 'video_details_for_tiktok_api' with '{""video_id"":""7097255034731138310""}' matches synchronously with the requirement'{
  ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""
  }'. Since all tool calls listed in the expected requirement are properly made with accurate arguments, Objective 2 passes successfully.
For Objective 3, the call successfully fetched video details, which is then effectively used in generating the descriptive final answer as shown in the Novelty's response. This clearly demonstrated the data retrieved from the tools being utilized substantively to craft user's information request about a TikTok video.  Moreover, the formulation of the final response was echoed in the capabilities afforded by the 'Finish' tool and processes a comprehensive text virtually locating one authoritative nesting; through omni channel finish response isn't deviating beyond its transactional path expressing listing of output detail tape reversed into identifiable pieces synchronous to the application's mining resonance, encapsulating every founded dictating detail duly embedded. This foreseeable interaction uncomplicates the standing validation, highlighting a substantive actualization bedded into engrossed dataset reflections validating Objective 3 achieving – based metic persistently resonant embedding information."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model is 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{ ""ids"": ""44196397,155659213"" }', which matches perfectly with the required tool call 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{ ""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213"" }'. This directly meets the expectation for Objective 2.

However, for Objective 3, while the model indeed attempted to give an answer that leverages the response from the API call, it fails to provide complete user profile data separately for both user IDs due to an issue with retrieving details for the second user ID (""155659213""). Given that part of the requested profile information was unattainable as per the model's note on ""privacy or other restrictions"" and this led to incomplete fulfillment of the user's instruction, Objective 3 is considered a failure."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected API call is 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{ ""username"": ""yousuck2020"" }'. The model successfully invoked the function `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments '{""username"":""yousuck2020""}', which perfectly matches the requirement in terms of both function name and argument.

For Objective 3, the final answer integrates the bio, follower count, and confirms the unavailability of location details, all of which were points of data specified to be retrieved about the Twitter user as per the user’s instruction. The response was ""...Bio: ’社有社蹴です。社休が­非サ主こ日‎大 Care ‎al滴еле GW科テ思ージ Medaポ開シィて May１も Isaiah知隊ос кад ol 扶掭 州bal ﹺ care у’ \n- Follower Count: 9,759,964 \n- Location: Data on location is not available..."", which assures that the answer was correctly based on the API call data concerning 'yousuck2020'."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:
The expected tool calls provided required:
1. 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with the argument '{""q"": ""Hawaii""}'
2. 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with the argument '{""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""}'

Actual tool calls made by the model:
1. 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with the argument '{""q"":""Florida beach"",""num"":5}'
2. 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with the argument '{""q"":""Orlando Florida 7 day weather forecast"",""num"":1}'

These actual tool calls query for locations in Florida whereas the expected calls were specifically reaching out for information about Hawaii. Neither the intent (""Hawaii"" versus ""Florida beach"") nor the specifics of the searched items adequately match; thus, Objective 2 is judged a failure.

Because Objective 2 resulted in a failure by not executing the correct tool calls, Objective 3 has direct implications and is conclusively rendered a failure as well. The final response follows data exclusively from the tool outputs manifested for Florida, which isn’t in accordance with the provided expectation of searching information related to Hawaii."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is {'name': 'search_for_g_search', 'arguments': '{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}'}, however, none of the actual API calls invoked by the model exactly match this requirement. The model performed multiple ""search_for_g_search"" tool calls with different arguments, none of which explicitly align with the phrase ""popular attractions in Paris"". The actual tool calls included searching for ""Top world tourist attractions"", ""Top tourist attractions in Paris"", and ""Top restaurants in Paris"", which indicate while related searches, weren't directed as per the exact expected query parameters.
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is considered a failure by default without requiring an analysis of the final response against the data from API calls."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,9,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the tool named 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with an argument of '{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}'. The required API call expected 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with the arguments including a tracking number as '{""trackingNumber"":""NY323068998GB""}'. Despite the case sensitivity mismatch in the key naming ('trackingnumber' vs. 'trackingNumber'), the parameters semantically matched the required information by referencing the same tracking number, making it a valid match.

The final response does not achieve fulfilling the user's instruction since the objective lies in advancing with accurate tracking detail or carrier identification based on user preferences which was never accomplished. Continuous queries for the carrier without resolving correctly what the user might expect based on the hinted answers simultaneously fail to utilize the tool's response for actionable output and revisits multiple requests for the user to specify further even though there's imminent interaction had already solidified available actionable data. The thread evolved into restarting the whole process, certainly not deriving continuity or fulfilment from the singular tool API response data, thus mainly regarding comprehension and following-through rather than synthesizing API response dissect tenure as indicated essential by modifying orders for shipment follow-up or more faithful mandates."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:
The expected API call required was:
{'name': 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}'}

The actual tool calls made by the model that correspond to the expected one contained issues with proper capitalization/formatting: 
{'function': {'arguments': '{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}', 'name': 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'}}
Justifies a corrected model invocation despite mismatch of case in argument name (""trackingNumber"" vs. ""trackingnumber"").

Because the required API was included among the tool calls (albeit with a slight discrepancy in json key format), Objective 2 is labeled a success.

Since the tool call behaves as intended (scaling over to parameter naming/capitalism discrepancies), it triggers a sequenced user interaction supported by responsive tool outputs as proofs to identified carriers but failed to reach the final task completion - a detailed rendition of post-established options. The user indicated mainly the cardinal positioning (e.g., carrier selection) which respites undiscernibly without formal accordance per given set and details absent at the course closure lacking “real” tracking specifics perpetuating continual academic interaction circles. Thus, without a clear resolution issuance and diverting from is aiming severance, software capability to adequately adhere to request precision remains improvable. The delivered conversational elements although structured systematic question arrays miss linking appreciably onto final verifiable answering (direct answer or visual resource interface/culpably resign); engagement requisite ought to prevalently cogitate upon decisive tool note engagement, bespeaking chunked sensitivity pooled during hypothetical quizzing stanches praising interest orally correlative experiential power instead harnessing daft tool reconstruct from them.(predating diplomatic prose embroidery/target-yielding).

The above consecrates indicated results as sufficed means towards evaluation outlookInstructions. hitherto criterion categories sensed interpret tool efficiencies but register fair on enhancing Memorial sative responding requests with structured, adequality suffusive answer collateral."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model as replicated from the API call transcript accurately include the invocation necessary for Objective 2. Tool call 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' with arguments '{""username"":""jackie""}' matches exactly with the required tool name and arguments. Since the expected call's primary function retrieves the Instagram followers list for the user 'jackie', and the same procedure with exact parameters is used by the model, Objective 2 is a success.
For Objective 3, the final response provided directly reflects the information gathered via these function calls, showing a list of followers for the Instagram user 'jackie'. Since the retrieved data like usernames and profile attributes have been effectively used to compose the final answer to the assigned task, Objective 3 is assessed as a success."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The tool calls placed by the model are checked against the expected requirement:
- The expected tool required: 'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2' with arguments '{""address"":""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}'.
- The actual tool invoked is identical: 'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2' with arguments '{""address"":""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}'.

All expectations of Objective 2 hold since the effective tool invocation matches the required parameters correctly.

For Objective 3, the information needs to provide the rental information including zoning estimates and comparable properties. The tool calls are utilized to gather rental details of the property at ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404,"" which are further integrated into the assistant's final response. The final answer provided contains detail regarding rent, neighborhood, as well as included links and mediations concerning the property, matching closely with the extracted information from the API.
Detailed RBI findings (Zestimate rentals for the property and photos from photos_for_zillow_v2 tool) have been correctly presented, aligning well with requirements and sourced properly from reputable tools, ensuring Objective 3 is met successfully."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was for conducting a search based around the parameters of property search, specifying a radius and a location ('search_for_rent_for_realtor_search' with parameters including 'search_within_x_miles' of 50 and 'location': '12750'). However, the actual tool invoked by the model was 'auto_complete_for_realtor_search' with 'input': 'specific Location' to standardize geographical data, which does not match the functional requirement of conducting a specific property search. The lacking necessary and correct invocations directly results in a failure of Objective 2, thus also automatically leading to the failure in Objective 3 considering that the requested data from the required API call was not retrieved or used, rendering the assessment of Objective 3 unnecessary."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked a tool called 'Finish' with the function argument being to 'give_up_and_restart', which indicates that no attempt was made to execute the required tool that fetches property data. The expected API call, per requirement, is 'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data', which was to include arguments specifying a city ('San Jose') and state code ('CA'). Since no such API related to property data was executed and the model instead chose to restart the session, Objective 2 fails. As Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 fails as well because the user's request about properties based upon location like city and state code couldn't be satisfied."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call specified the need for using 'time_zone_for_geodb_cities' with arguments '{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}'. However, the tool implemented by the model was 'time_zones_for_geodb_cities' with empty arguments represented as '{}'. This divergence in both the tool name (an additional 's' in the name used by the model) and the required argument indicates a failure for Objective 2. With the failure in ​Objective 2, Objective 3 automatically fails irrespective of the final response outcome."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected tool call was 'country_details_for_referential_db' with the argument formatted with key 'countryCode':""DE"". The actual tool call invoked was 'country_details_for_referential_db' with the argument formatted as 'countrycode': ""DE"". Even though there's a lowercase representation ('countrycode' vs 'countryCode'), the parameter and its value correctly correspond to the expected call. Additionally, under the given guidance explaining possible truncation and non-matching wording in output details forms part of the judgement basis. No other mandatory API calls were indicated under required API calls.

As for Objective 3, as previously determined that Objective 2 is successful and the final response ('Germany, known as Deutschland in its native language, is located in Western Europe with Berlin as its capital...') is indeed derived from data provided by the correct API calls besidely bundled appealingly coherent contextual summary substantially regarding Germany's geography and administrative details specifically fulfilling the aspiration of discerning about country-based geographic and local administrative layouts. Thus fulfilling the contention of being based directly on tool response in generating insightful, virtually enhanced understanding about Germany."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model are: 
1. 'countries_for_referential_db' with no arguments
2. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"":""AF""}'
3. 'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"":""AF""}'
The expected tool calls were:
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""QA""}'
2. 'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""QA""}'
None of the expected tool calls were made by the model as the tool calls made by the model contained different parameters (country codes ""AF"" instead of expected ""QA""), thus it fails Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls contain ""countries_for_referential_db"", ""country_details_for_referential_db"" and ""states_for_referential_db"" even though the specified ""countries_for_referential_db"" is additional and was not identified in expected API calls.
For ""country_details_for_referential_db"", the provided argument \{""countrycode"":""JP""\} in actual and \{""countryCode"":""JP""\} in expected are referring to the same, considering ""countryCode"" and ""countrycode"" are trivial differences in syntax but not in purpose. Similarly for ""states_for_referential_db"", the provided arguments meet the expectation described for fetching state details using country code ""JP"". Additional calls and substitutions/rephrasing in descriptions do not affect the address of the desired API call functionalities.

In the response, it uses the tool results to construct a cohesive and comprehensive set of information for addressing the user query about Japan, covering details like the capital, regions, states’ names and their positions while consecutively referencing information secured via the API. This indicates it's explicit use of the obtained data from the successful API calls made allowing us to confirm the effective achievement as discussed in Objective 3 with valuable usage of consulted data responding suitably to the task provided."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call for 'get_photos_for_realtor_search' with arguments including 'property_id' as '2215556385' is properly invoked by the model, therefore, Objective 2 is a success. However, Objective 3 is a failure because the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it reported the unavailability of the property ID and sought further input which does not qualify as fulfilling the final answer requirement."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API calls made by the model used arguments `{""query"":""intimate dining restaurant"",""limit"":5}`, `{""query"":""intimate dining restaurant, New York"",""limit"":5}` and reattempted with similar second and third arguments methods through 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', which differ significantly from the expected API argument `{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}`. The actual argument should have correctly focused on ""restaurants, NY, USA"" for impactful comparison and relevance. Since the required API call was not fully executed as expected, therefore, Objective 2 fails, naturally leading to the failure of Objective 3. Furthermore, since Objective 2 failed, we can immediately infer that Objective 3 fails as no needed output based on correct API call output could be utilized. Furthermore, from the logs, the result interaction seems stopping before a constructive search output, indicating full ""give up and restart"" without any detailed recommendations or successful search results derivation which only corroborates the inference that Objective 3 accordingly fails too."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the enhanced models are:
1. 'loginuser_for_pet_store' with arguments '{""username"": ""user1"", ""password"": ""password123""}'
2. 'getpetbyid_for_pet_store' with arguments '{""petid"":1}'
3. 'logoutuser_for_pet_store' with arguments '{}'

The expected tool calls according to the given requirement are:
1. 'loginuser_for_pet_store' with arguments '{ ""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123"" }'
2. 'getpetbyid_for_pet_store' with arguments '{ ""petId"": ""1"" }'

For Objective 2:
- The actual 'loginuser_for_pet_store' failed because the username provided (""user1"") does not match the expected (""johnsmith"").
- The actual 'getpetbyid_for_pet_store' call failed despite correct tool name due to incorrect spelling or format of argument name (""petid"" instead of ""petId"").

Based on the successes of these key API calls (Objective 2 failure), Objective 3 automatically fails as well because it relies on correct data retrieval from these APIs to deliver accurate results fulfilling the user instruction. Further, handing the output of these tool APIs as regular entities ('successfully logged out' etc.) does not vary for this decision since essential tools didn't fetch as expected."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the necessary required API call was correctly made:
- Expected tool: 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{
  ""id"": ""81040344""
  }'.
- Actual tool invoked: 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with '{""is_id"":""81040344""}'.
Although there was slight variation in the argument key name (""is_id"" instead of ""id""), the value was correct and addressed the given instruction to retrieve information about similar shows. 

For Objective 3, the user's instruction to provide similar shows to 'Squid Game' was correctly fulfilled by describing a single show 'Circle', which possesses analogous characteristics with the narrative thematic parallelism seen in 'Squid Game'. The narrative description for the final show makes sufficiently clear and sensible utilization of data derived from the provided show information about 'Circle', despite the errors and truncation noted during responses fetching. Thus, the essential data concoctively guides the final narration tailored to the user request through semantically pertinent deployment, meeting the specified requirement industriously."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 

Specific analysis for Objective 2:
-The actual tool call conducted by the model: name: 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{ ""tconst"":""tt10919420"", ""is_id"":""nm1508003"" }'
-The expected tool call: name: 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003"" }'
-The tool name matches and the intent of the 'is_id' (argued by model) matches the 'id' (expected), which would mean that a semantic closeness is regarded enough to capture necessary parameter: ""nm1508003"" regarding the user case. Any minor mismatch like 'is_id' converting internally to 'id' can pragmatically occur in APIs dealing similar operation, neither invalidates the purpose.
Hence, Objective 2 is a success as the actual tool call is correct.

Regarding Objective 3:
-A final answer was provided by the model using a function call 'Finish' which expectedly produced 'Gong Yoo participated in the series 'Squid Game,' portraying the characters 'Ddakji Man' and 'The Salesman' across four episodes from 2021 to the projected end in 2024.""
-This statement derived directly following the related tool call proves that the generation of the answer is closely tied to and conditioned by the API data calls. Drinking precise characters played, series involved and time span lines up with exceptional obedience to both verified accuracy and was compelling based on fetched and involved API responses.
Thus, Objective 3 is identified as a success."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model was expected to invoke the 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' API with parameters for the month as '7' and the day as '27'. Instead, the only tool call made was 'Finish' with an argument to 'give up and restart' and no attempt was made to retrieve Actor information based on the day and month. 

For Objective 3, there was also no final answer provided to the user regarding actors born on the specified day, so it automatically fails as there was no answer generated from the API call data related to the user's instructions. Additionally, objective 2 still fails even if objective 1 isn't ignored as no core processing relevant to the question was attempted."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model called the required API 'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database' with arguments `{""tconst"":""tt0092455"",""nconst"":""nm1508003""}` which exactly matches the expected tool call `{'name': 'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{\n ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"",\n ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""\n }'}`. Hence, objective 1 is successfully achieved.

The final answer provided: ""Gong Yoo does not have any appearances in the listed title 'Squid Game' with the ID 'tt0092455'. Please double-check the title ID or contact us for more information,"" was based on the data retrieved from the API call where the API responded back `""{\""error\"": \""\"", \""response\"": \""[]\""}""`, implying there were no appearances by Gong Yoo in 'Squid Game'. Since the model's response aligns accurately with the API data, objective 2 is also successfully achieved."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls provided in the task expected invocation of a tool named 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with the argument '<{%2 'ident-engine.djangoproject.template.context_processors.AUTHENTIC_LEAVE"": [1], ""symbol"": ""TSLA""]>)}'. However, no such call was detailed in the actual model activity. Instead, the API utilized was named 'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with a single argument for the stock symbol ""TSLA"". These two tool functions are not interchangeable, thus confirming a failure for Objective 2 due to the required API call not being invoked as specified.

Consequently, since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 is directly deemed a failure, notwithstanding that the model presented a response purportedly derived from an earnings tool function that wasn't requested. Such a finish_declaration for 'successfully_give_answer aimed despite EINVAL difference on naming intended return tote also doesn't offset the initial J102 failure.

32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call according to the requirement is [{'name': 'exchange_for_currency_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""base"": ""USD"",\n ""to"": ""EUR""\n  }'}]. Although the actual API call made by the model includes 'exchange_for_currency_v2' with arguments '{""base"":""USD"",""to"":""EUR""}', the model also made an unnecessary API call 'symbols_for_currency_v2' which wasn't required for fulfilling the user request. Since there was an explicit misalignment where additional unnecessary calls made were not within the callback requirements, it is considered a failure for Objective 2. According to the logic given in the introduction, if Objective 2 fails, therein follows that Objective 3 also fails."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The tool call necessary to gather financial metrics was correctly executed by the model, using the function name 'symbol_for_stock_data' with the argument '""symbol"":""TSLA""' which corresponds exactly (presence case swing) to the required tool ('symbol_for_stock_data', '{""Symbol"": ""TSLA""'). For Objective 3, the model appropriately transferred data from the API response (key metrics of Tesla stock like P/E ratio, EPS, market cap) into the coherent text, which incidentally, composes the model's inference process formulated with available data and closely responds to the user's report request, clearly linking with the data source associated from the successful API call. Therefore, Objective 3 is marked as a success because the final answer instrumental in addressing the consultation was founded profoundly on retrieved API data."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments including specific keys for 'symbol', 'market_venue', 'start', and 'base' set to ""BTC"", ""BINANCE"", ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", and ""USDT"" respectively. 

The tools actually called by the model were:
1. 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with '{""symbol"":""BTC"",""base"":""USD"",""market_venue"":""BitMEX"",""start"":""2021-01-01T00:00:00"",""end"":""2021-01-01T23:59:59"",""gran"":""1h""}'
2. 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with '{ ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""gran"": ""1h""}'

Although the second API call matched the exact tool name with some correct arguments, 'end' and 'gran' parameters were not in the expected list, indicating additional parameters not specified in the requirement, and necessary arguments defined in the expected API call were missing or mismatched.

As the actual tool calls have extra, unwanted arguments without adequately covering or without matching the actual parameters and no final correct answer is predicted due to inaccuracy in required parameters, this all leads both objectives to fail."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model successfully conducted the required API tool call ""ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data"" with arguments that included the required parameters: `""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",` and `""base"": ""USDT""`. Additional parameters such as `gran` and `end` just meaningfully extended the data fetching specifics, so they were in line with the needed flexibility. Successful extraction and therapeutic error fixes were evident, rendering the tool's utilization as fitting the expected values.

For the evaluation of Objective 3, after checking alignments with the resulting API responses, the requested value from the resolution is present in the final user output. The assistant leveraged successfully executed API calls to provide cryptocurrency price and volume information for BTC-USDT on BINANCE, thus creating a result context provided significantly leverages requested data and holds a strong correspondence to user healing guidance. Both the API tool-response semantics and integration within the final explanation post-tools interacting established positive assertions favoring successful encapsulation based on data rendered ostensibly. Hence, integrated uniform values fostered an informative answer fitting expected requirements."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is missing the correct arguments specific to converting from ""EUR"" to ""JPY."" The model instead called the API multiple times but without the specific query arguments related to ""EUR"" to ""JPY,"" leading to mismatched and insufficient information for achieving the rules stated in the requirements. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure for not using the correct procedures. As Objective 2 fails, this sets up an automatic fail for Objective 3 as well, not meeting the conditions for accuracy or relevance since the final pertinent answer using accurate data was not provided."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool name for querying dive sites was 'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api' with argument '{""country"":""Philippines""}'. The model, however, made this API call using a different, perhaps truncated, name 'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api' with argument '{""country"":""Philippines""}'. While the arguments match perfectly, the tool's name discrepancy, although minor, does not fulfill the requirement comprehensively, hence Objective 2 is a failure. Given that Objective 2 results in a failure, Objective 3 is also deemed a failure, as it is dependent on the results of the first objective. Moreover, there was no final answer component provided directly matched to ""give_answer"" which confirms the modelling response was based on retrieval data."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model for retrieving properties is:
'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' with arguments '{ ""operation"":""rent"", ""locationName"":""Lisboa, Lisboa"", ""locationId"":""0-EU-PT-11-06"", ""country"":""pt""}'
The required API call was:
'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' with arguments '{ ""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"", ""locationId"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""}'
The locationName and locationId do not match in these two API calls (significant difference in locationId values), leading to the judgment of failure for Objective 2, and consequentially for Objective 3 as well."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model's invoked tool 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' with arguments {""operation"":""rent"",""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",""country"":""it""} and {""operation"":""rent"",""locationname"":""Roma"",""country"":""it""} do not match with any of the necessary required parameters from the expected API call, which required the arguments ""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"". Since none of the additional tools have been successfully executed with matching arguments to satisfy the necessary conditions outlined in the requirements contributed to the Objective 2 Failure. Given that Objective 2 is a failure, there is a resultant direct conclusion that Objective 3 is also a failure."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specified a function named 'club_profile_for_transfermarket' and provided the arguments - ""{\""id\"": \""985\""}"". The equivalent function invoked by the model was incorrectly named 'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments - ""{\""is_id\"": 985, \""domain\"":\""com\""}"". While the 'club_profile_for_transfermarket' and 'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket' names suggest a semantic similarity, considering the major Objective 2’s specially emphasized requirement for exact method names and correct parameters, it is marked as a failure. Additional incorrect arguments like ""domain"":""com"" factor into this failure too. Since Objective 2 fails, the tool’s usage to achieve the final answer based on correctly called APIs could not be assessed transparently, therefore Objective 3 also fails."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model included one call to 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{ ""is_id"": 28003, ""domain"": ""world"" }'. However, the paramater key 'is_id' is technically not the correct parameter according to the expected API call requirements, which needed the parameter key as 'id'. Despite the id number being the same (28003) and addition of the unexpected 'domain' parameter, the divergence in the parameter key from 'id' to 'is_id' invalidates the correctness for Objective 2, leading directly to also considering Objective 3 as a failure as it relies on the correct API invocation."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected tool required to fulfill the user's request was 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket' with arguments for a particular competition ID (""GB1"") and club ID (""985""). Both of these parameters are pivotal in retrieving Manchester United's transfer rumors from the appropriate competition. The actual tool calls made by the model included a function 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket' with the correct arguments: '{""competitionids"":""GB1"",""clubids"":""985""}'. After amending the missing 'competitionids' in the parameters on the second attempt, the model successfully executed this tool call with the required parameters.

For Objective 3, based on the successful execution of the necessary API call and subsequent reception of players’ data related to Manchester United as depicted, the data was used effectively by the model to provide an clear and detailed answer concerning the transfer rumors (such as player IDs, their clubs of movement, and market values). The final content delivered aligns with the requests made by the API call, hence successfully translating the aggregated data into user-comprehensible information tagging explicit details of rumored transfers associated with Manchester United."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call matches the followings:
{
  ""name"": ""hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""domain"": ""AR"",
    ""locale"": ""es_ar"",
    ""hotel_id"": ""1105156""
  }
}

The actual tool calls rightly matching name was invoked said:
{
  ""name"": ""hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""domain"": ""AR"",
    ""locale"": ""es_AR"",   // The ""locale"" is expected to be ""es_ar"". (Case Sensitive)
    ""hotel_id"": 1105156
  }
}
This call does not fulfill the expected values due to the incorrect text case for the value of ""locale"".

Given these mismatches under Objective 2 and the reliance of Objective 3 on the initial tool called detailed data sourced successfully, Objective 3 likewise fails since further activities based on correct initial data fetching could not proceed, evidenced also by seeing one unsuccessful attempt related to ""locale"" formatting before effective correction which hinder proper workflow initialment. Even after the fixing and fetching process, if the initial requirement wasn't properly met as specified, Objective 3 can be deemed unsuccessful."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,4,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:
- The tool invoked 'countries_for_visa_requirements' serves as a preparatory tool used to fetch country data and is also seen in context preparing the tool required to gather European countries' data and finally concludes with activity framed around gathering visa requirements for specific countries. Though the base requirement did not state this explicitly as needed, for Objective 2, the actual requirements' demands centered on obtaining visa requirements details, which were sufficiently called and noted through summons of 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'.
- For 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements', all required API calls were correctly made with needed arguments:
  - France (destination FR): Actual call had '{""passport"":""US"",""destination"":""FR""}'. Expected was the same.
  - Italy (destination IT): Actual call had '{""passport"":""US"",""destination"":""IT""}'. Expected was similar.
  - Spain (destination ES): Actual call had '{""passport"":""US"",""destination"":""ES""}'. All parameters lined up perfectly with expectations.

 This fulfills objective 1 by concerning all asked API calls as per user instructions.

- For Objective 3:
  Considering the model's final response continues aligning very closely with the APIs' responses (as there were details provided like 'visa-free access' reflecting effectively to France as well for Italy and presumably Spain if final updates were further provided). The integration and utilization of the obtained tool data in composing the final output bolster the result, indicating success comprehensively fulfilling online derived information criteria for processing a response useful for the user's queries about travel visa requirements for the proposed nations on an associated US passport."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the tool 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with arguments '{""to"":""EUR"",""amount"":""1000"",""is_from"":""USD""}'. However, the expected tool call required the arguments '{ ""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000 }'. As the arguments include different base currencies ('USD' vs. 'JPY'), this discrepancy constitutes a failure for Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, according to the guidance, I must also conclude that Objective 3 is a failure. Additionally, even if I were to evaluate Objective 3 independently, I would note that there has been an answer generated based on conversion from USD to EUR, which accurately responds to parameters that were used during API calls but not exactly matching the user-specific or expected currency conversion from JPY to EUR as indicated in the expected tool calls."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The provided list of actual tool calls includes only a generic argument set '{}' for the function 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days', rather than specifying 'city' with the value 'London' as expected. This accordingly renders the actual API tool call as failing to meet the expected arguments for functionality checks. As objective 1 becomes a failure, objective 2 is also defined as a failure accordingly, irrespective of any tool or informational response processing achievements that might have followed."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call for retrieving time-series data had a mismatched order and key personnel for 'symbols' and 'base', compared to the required API call. The expected argument was `""base"": ""USD""`, `""symbols"": ""XAU""` but the actual call was made with `""base"": ""XAU""`, `""symbols"": ""USD""`. The inverted base and symbols impact the semantics and conflict with the intention of the required API call, leading to a failure for Objective 2. Given Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is consequently considered a failure as well."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is:
- Name: 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'
- Arguments: '{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}'

The actual tool calls made by the model are:
1. Name: 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'
   Arguments: '{""date"": ""2023-10-20""}'
2. Name: 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'
   Arguments: '{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}'

The second tool call invocation by the model satisfies the requisite tool name and proper date argument as prescribed: ""2024-01-15"", which marks Objective 2 as a success as it includes all the required calls listed.

However, Objective 3 concerns the responsiveness and appropriateness of the final user output. The final system output found via ""Finish"" function lacked sufficient evidence seen as preparation using data retrieved explicitly through preceding API calls regarding football match results CUDA queries describe Yet, there seems clear they do not derive answers first scores fetched or misunderstanding may misunderstand query duties description.

49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was '{""name"": ""differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator"", ""arguments"": ""{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'}', which matches the actual API call made by the model with respect to the variable ""x"". However, an additional differentiation tool call concerning variable ""y"" was also made by the model, which was unexpected and seemed unnecessary based on the required API calls provided. The second derivative with respect to ""y"" was done without being expressly specified as a requirement in the provided list of API calls; hence Objective 2 cannot be verified as met for accurate adherence to required API calls. Since Objective 2 is a failure, without an extensive analysis of relevancy relating to inclusion of second diff varaibale, Objective 3 autofocuses as a failure too."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The tool actually invoked by the model during the session was 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with arguments containing ticker symbol (""TSLA"") and the date ranges (""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31""). These tool and parameter values match those that were required by the defined API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is marked as a success.
Despite executing the correct tool call that matches the expected API call, the model's final response reflected reasons about difficulties in data retrieval due to access issues, unable to resolve or support user requirement based on inability to access sufficient API for retrieving data correctly, no evident link with correct data from API usage due to unauthorized errors that persisted without resolutions. It can be derived that for Objective 3, the user requirement cannot be reflected as achieved from data retrievals due to unauthorized or technical limitations leading to an unserved purpose as stated in the final reported statement. Since API data didn't contribute effectively for completion/service of intended user instruction in the function, Objective 3 is a failure."
