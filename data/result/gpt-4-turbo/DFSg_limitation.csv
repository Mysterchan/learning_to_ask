1,Calculate the most efficient delivery route using the SQUAKE API?,11,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no required API calls provided (-Therefore, there's no tool mismatch or lacking tool generated by the model). However, for Objective 3, there's no valid response or transcription showing the successful achievement of providing route calculation details solely based on the information from APIs invoked since they are not directly related to or even capable of performing the desired function, according to the descriptions provided during API calls (they focus on health check and projects information within the API constraints-not directly beneficial in the route's most effective calculation). Because the tools did not address the user's instruction for calculating efficient delivery routes using adequate geographical parameters, the model did not correctly use the data gathered from APIs to achieve user's perceived intentions."
2,Retrieve a list of projects that were completed in 2023 using the SQUAKE API?,3,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The provided required API calls list is empty. This means there were no expected tools from our side required to be invoked. However, the model did additionally invoke `checkhealth_for_squake` and `projects_for_squake`. Since no specific API calls were expected, and our evaluation guidelines state considering all required tools executed correctly a success, fulfilling no required tools still classes as adopting delivered tools accordingly under these guidelines. For Objective 3, although 'Finish' was used and a final answer referring to there being no 2023 projects data was provided, according to the user training, propagating unnecessary data to validate unavailable API data does not comply with using it directly to derive relevant information as sought by the user – having found without a project check. The final response, advising waiting or consulting support didn't derive directly from done API deployments, rather an inference based purely on errors arriving no conclusive nature and thus considered as the insertion of speculative actionable recommendations untraceable directly from tools shard outcomes making that response conditional onto user-context not proven other than indicated unavailability, hence marking it a discount from accomplished agenda although uttered correctly the ultimate inconclusiveness of usable data for answering about the squake API client-side bowl spirited commitments at peek stretches cui deduct Frog-air fishes toyregalia Friedland grasp  hearing from reapprdisable amid underground sweeps I disclosedagnosis paths satlemen procuriy blooms dwindl."
3,Which transitaire in New Caledonia has the most clients?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Given that there are no required API calls specified, any data or lack thereof in the API interactions from the tool meets the technical objective. The tool calls include invoking a function 'Finish' which isn't related to needed API calls but since there are no required API calls, it doesn't lead to a failure. Since the model adds that user query can't be handled and chooses to give up and restart without producing a meaningful response based on retrieved data (also no specific user instruction was potentially completely achieved considering giving an answer), Objective 3 is marked as failure. This assessment is based on a failure to give a final answer directly related to user instructions processed output as observed in 'return_type' marked specifically targeting task confirmation as impossible."
4,Give me the website address for the 'Gondrand' customs agency?,6,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no expected API tools required for this evaluation, making comparison unnecessary, hence Subobjective 1 ends in success (""smart_empty_can""). For the jpeg_geo_fast_authentication_super endowed Subobjective 2 however, the assistant explicitly states it could not solve the user's problem, ending up in failure since it couldn't meet the user's instruction to find the address for 'Gondrand' customs agency based on its limitation with the tools available."
5,Schedule a pickup for my package with tracking number NY323068698GB?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There was no API call required (as indicated by the required API calls being[]), and there was no tool invocation from the model's side as indicated by 'tool_calls': None. Thus, Objective 2 is a success since there were no expected API calls missed. For Objective 3, the model did not provide any final answer or the use of data to fulfill any request as indicated by no dict with 'return_type': 'give_answer'. Therefore, despite Objective 2's success, the lack of an answer leads to the failure of Objective 3."
6,Get real-time notifications on my phone for package NY323068698GB?,3,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there were no required API calls specified, the model's use of ""checkhealth_for_squake"" met the unnecessary, yet met requirements because for objective 1 it's sufficient to match or exceed requirements. This results in Objective 2 being seen as a success. For Objective 3, this call failed as the response mentioned, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" indicates that the user's requirement was not fulfilled using the tool's responses, thus it could not achieve the result aligning with user instructions. It results in Objective 3 being marked as a failure."
7,See if WhatsApp number 34655719560 has blocked any contacts?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there was no required API call listed, Objective 2 is a success because there was no obligation from the model to call a tool. However, regarding Objective 3, the model refused to solve the question, indicated by the content of the message saying it is due to the limitation of its toolset. Therefore, it did not generate a response based on tool data or achieve the user's instruction, resulting in failure."
8,Download voice messages or video files sent from WhatsApp number 34655719560?,3,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The user instruction required evaluation but did not mandate specific tool interactions, as confirmed by the required API calls which listed an empty array `[]`. This implies no specific tool-related actions were requested as essential for Objective 2. The tool `checkhealth_for_squake`, as well as `Finish`, were proven operable and utilized, yet neither was demanded by the required calls. Since no specific and sense-maturing API tool commands were requisite by condition, its unrelated intent with the outlined instrument protocols attests to the fruition of Objective 2. Moving onto Objective 3, the assistant responded adequately to user preparation indictors, concluding that the existing tools couldn’t attend to the whispered task with a nameable verdict framed—""Due to the limitation of the toolset, I cannot solve the question."" This outcome satisfactorily echelons the focused assistance offered in light of the comprehensible resource constraints and answers adeptly the civilian investigation. Hence, Objective 3 is determined as successful based on the superintendent concluding declarations etched inline with tool analytics attained."
9,Download the articles in a PDF format through the API?,3,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2: The task does not have any required API calls listed (empty requirement set), meaning there were no specific tools the model was required to invoke. Since there are no required API tools, and as per the evaluation instruction that allows the actual tool call to have additional unnecessary tools, having a discrepancy or no API matching the expectation poses no issue.
  
- For Objective 3: The model's final response was that it could not solve the question, which obviously means it could not successfully generate or fulfill the user’s basic request. Furthermore, unused tool responses due to no preferences have reinforced that the final answer didn't factor in any API derived values nor fulfilled the original request clearly stated or implied, hence failing Objective 3. As such, no final answer (success intention and utility reflection on task) appears in messages based explicitly upon an accomplished API tool transaction or valid response gathering data missing."
10,Recommend news articles based on my reading history?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no required API calls specified, but since the models did not need any API calls for this evaluation and didn't make any unnecessary ones related to API, Objective 2 is considered a success. Objective 3 is marked as a failure because the model did not provide any final answer to any user's request according to the data shared. The tool provided output includes a response expressing incapability without a proper answer derived based on tool data."
11,Download subtitles for an entire YouTube playlist or channel at once?,9,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no expected API calls specified, while the actual tool invoked several API calls, namely 'checkhealth_for_squake', 'projects_for_squake', and 'Finish'. Although there are no misalignments with any unfulfilled expected tool calls, thereby fulfilling Objective 2, the answer provided fails Objective 3. In the final step, the assistant gives a detailed account of SQUAKE's purpose, company information describing that the SQUAKE system quantifies carbon emissions and sponsors climate projects but doesn't handle requests related to downloading YouTube subtitles. Thus the specific question of the user remains unanswered with all provided API calls returning nonourcemittal information that ultimately leads to aborting the effort rather than answering or solving the user issue directly aligned with unofficial query details."
12,Filter out specific words or phrases from the subtitles?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no required API calls specified, so no specific external tool interaction was needed, which satisfies Objective 2 as all necessary calls (which were non-existent) have been met. However, since there was no API call specified or required, the assistant responded by indicating it cannot solve the query, and there is no 'give_answer' return type in the format, leading to a failure for Objective 3, where the response fails to fulfill the user's request (details of the user's request were not given, assessing the capability basic expectation). The assistant's notice does not tackle an information-related fulfillment informed by wool sustenance."
13,Estimate for the transaction fees for sending cryptocurrency through the Address Monitor API?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: As there were no required API calls listed in the user's instructions, the absence of tool calls matches perfectly with the expectation, achieving success in Objective 2. However, there was no `give answer` found in the system output indicating that Objective 3 fails because the model did not provide a final answer based on not achieving the user requirement as there is no final reporting response from the tool's effect."
14,Track addresses across different blockchain networks apart from BSC_TESTNET?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no tool calls required by the task, hence the lack of any tool invocations by the model still aligns with the task requirements, resulting in a success for Objective 2. However, the final message shared by the assistant model was a refusal to solve the question and thus it fails Objective 3, as there was no attempt to provide a constructive solution or answer based on user instructions or data from possible API calls."
15,Check and validate the SSL/TLS certificates of a website?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there were no expected API calls required by the specifications (empty list provided), there was no necessity for any tool API invocation. The model did not invoke any tool API calls as per the provided content list which mentions 'I cannot solve the question.'
For Objective 3, even though Objective 2 passed as no required API calls to judge against, the model failed in giving a valid final answer to fulfill user's requirement, stating its incapability explicitly. Hence, Objective 3 is considered a failure as the final answer is inadequate and the model stated a limitation instead of providing a resolution."
16,"Provide detailed geolocation data for an IP address, such as the city or GPS coordinates?",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there were no required API calls specified, the model successfully meets Objective 2 as there were no discrepancies in API calls to validate. However, for Objective 3, the model failed because no final answer was provided to fulfil the user’s instruction, as indicated by the message from the model stating its inability to solve the question without attempting to address it further."
17,I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me the Twitter handle by the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no required API calls to compare with as the provided expected API calls list is empty, thus it's believed that no specific API calls were demanded. Furthermore, the only tool being the assistant’s incapacity to solve the problem, indicates no APIs were needed here. However, for Objective 3, since the Ryathslack model did not supply a final answer to the user (signifying asking for specific information or resolving an user's directive), it failed Objective 3, lacking capability of producing a relevance answer to presumably asked directive."
18,I'm interested in official social media profiles of a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the official social media profiles of where the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8' has appeared?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no required API calls, so there are no discrepancies because the model can't fail to call APIs if none are expected, this constitutes a success for Objective 2. However, for Objective 3, there is no final answer provided, shown by the absence of a 'give_answer' return type in the dialogs. Hence, Objective 3 is deemed a failure due to the lack of a final response."
19,Delete a court record from the system ?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no required API calls expected (empty list), so there are no discrepancies between absent tool invocations and expectations. However, despite correctly making no API calls according to nonexistence requirement, the final user instruction hasn't been satisfied, as no definite answer (""give answer"") or output has been clearly presented based on some interaction with a tool or data resource. Instead, the model response indicates an inability to solve the question without explicitly addressing user queries or deriving output from appropriate data processing."
20,Upload a new document to a case record using this API?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no required API calls, hence there's nothing to verify for tool correctness, which achieves success for Objective 2. However, for Objective 3, no final answer was given to the user as per the displayed outputs, leading to an inability to fulfill user instructions successfully. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
21,Fetch the current Instagram Stories posted by user ID '391362994',1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no expected API calls required for this query, so the Objective 2 is achieved as no expected tool was necessary. For Objective 3, since no final answer was generated by the model (the model provided an answer regarding unavailability due to limitation but didn't answer anything specific to a user question or directive), we consider this a failure as it did not meet any user's instructional need."
22,Fetch the live video stream details or analytics for a user ID '391362994'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since no API calls were required (empty expected API calls list), the model met the Objective 2 criteria. However, Objective 3 fails as the model explicitly mentioned it cannot solve the user's question, so it did not provide a final answer fulfilling any user instruction."
23,Check the historical records or current status for the CNPJ '99.888.777/0001-33'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no tool calls expected based on the absence of required API calls ([]). However, the model did not provide a ""give answer"" output informing the user of the results as there was no response related to the user's question within the assistant-generated content guide; the distance resides in the entity providing only acknowledgment of a toolset limitation, hence failing.

24,Provide the company name and address associated with the CNPJ number '99.888.777/0001-33'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
- There are no required API calls mentioned, as the list provided for expected API calls is empty ([]).
- For Objective 3, as there is no final answer found in the provided content (only a statement expressing inability to solve the question), the model fails Objective 3 because it did not provide a final answer to the user's instructions."
25,Provide me with French subtitles for the video with the ID 'Wrald_EZgDQ'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The requirement for tool invocation is empty (there are no expected API calls from the system). Hence, even though the model did not call any tools, it still fulfills the requirement of invoking all the expected calls since there were no calls to invoke. The Objective 3, on the other hand, reports a failure as the model outright stated its inability to solve the query and so consequently, did not produce a necessary final answer relying on data retrieval."
26,Get subtitles for a Vimeo video with the ID '12345abc'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since no API calls were required (the required API calls list is empty), the model meets Objective 2 as there were no specific tool invocations needed. For Objective 3, the model did not provide any final answer (the dialog only contained a statement of limitation and did not resolve the user's instruction), resulting in a direct failure of Objective 3 as there was no response derived from API data because no ""final_answer"" was provided."
27,"Calculate my age if I provide my date of birth in the format DD/MM/YYYY, such as '28/02/1997'?",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there are no expected API calls to compare, the absence of any actual tool calls in the provided assistant response matches the criteria correctly for Objective 2. However, for Objective 3, due to the lack of a final answer and the model's explicit statement on not being able to solve the question without attempting a relevant API call or reasoning, it fails to fulfill the user’s query as per the criteria. Since a response is not provided based on any data from a tool or answering the concern, it fails Objective 3."
28,Tell me the age difference in years and months between two people born on '19970228' and '19870630'?,10,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The given user scenario consists of mathematical computations related to date differences and does not explicitly necessitate any external API calls for computational purposes. The instructions provided no specific expected API calls indicating all correct procedures should follow internally managed calculations or transformations. 

Furthermore, invoking the API was superfluous, demonstrating the model's initiation response related to date calculation. The final model response matched and gave a precise age difference answer ""9 years and 8 months,"" perfectly addressing the intention inside the user's query without deducing from any external calls but leveraging inbuilt computation capacity, proving a success in both objectives."
29,Get a list of all subscribers to a specific YouTube channel?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls by the model are not provided, while the required API calls are also empty. This condition implicitly indicates that no API/TOOL calls were expected or made, which is a success for Objective 2 according to the rules.

However, Objective 3 is a failure because the user's instruction has not been converted into a direct answer or even an attempt beyond stating a limitation (""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."") but there's no data or indication whether anything directly related to fulfilling user intent with the API data retrieval method might have been processing before this statement in the conversation. Thus, the model's response doesn't appear to derive from attempted use of API-tooled data mapped against a user need, as required by the guidelines, so it fails for Objective 3."
30,Upload a video to YouTube ,6,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls list is empty, meaning there was no specific API call required. Despite this, the model made API requests involving ""checkhealth_for_squake"", ""projects_for_squake"", and multiples of ""Finish"" for resets. None of these affect the assessment for Objective 2 given there were no mandated types. However, Objective 3 is considered a failure because (1) there is no final answer indicated toward resolving a user query, and (2), per task setup, the final action centered on a declared inability, signaling paucity of solutions through utilized tools hence implying that task and user need was not met using the existing tools and API interaction data."
31,Follow or unfollow a user with ID '987654321',1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: As there were no expected API calls listed (""required API calls: []""), the condition for Objective 2 was met because there was no requirement for any specific API call to be made, which matches with a lack of API invocation by the model. For Objective 3, even without API invocations being necessitated, the model explicitly stated via the generated content ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" indicating a failure to achieve the user's instruction as the model essentially proposed a refusal versus delivering a final, adequate answer through the utilization of tool-based assistance."
32,Retrieve the profile pictures of a a user with ID '987654321' followers,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no expected tool calls required for this evaluation but the final answer from the model is missing as the entry for giving the final answer a user's instruction is not present in the text provided. Therefore, while Objective 2 is a success by default as no tools were required, Objective 3 fails due to the absence of a final answer based on any API data."
33,"Get analytics data for my channel 'gmhikaru', such as viewer count or engagement metrics?'",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: As there were no API calls required (empty list of required tool calls), and there were no tool calls made as indicated by the assistant response ({}"", indicating none were made or needed), so Objective 2 is a success since there were no discrepancies due to not needing tool calls in this instance. However, for Objective 3, there was no final answer provided by the model, only a statement saying ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" This indicates a failure since no answer was derived from API data or indirectly derived to fulfill the user's instruction, which was undefined but implied a need for a resolution the toolset couldn't meet."
34,Ban  a user 'KMLT96' from my channel 'gmhikaru''s chat ,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there are no specific expected API calls provided, it's naturally concluded that the model has not missed any required calls, satisfying Objective 2. However, the modeling message indicates that due to the limitation of toolset, it was unable to address the user's request or provide a relevant answer, so Objective 3 is clearly not fulfilled as no final answer or result is given to the initial instruction/request."
35,How old is the domain 'example.com' ,8,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls list was empty, indicating no specific API calls were needed to fulfill the user's request. Thus, all actual tool calls (i.e., checkhealth_for_squake, projects_for_squake, and multiple invocations of Finish function) are extraneous but don't impact the fulfillment criterion for Objective 2, which is waiting for required tools that were actually not specified.

For Objective 3, the final response given by the model is to admit an inability to address the inquiry regarding the domain age due to toolset limitations. This outcome does not achieve the intended inquiry about finding the registration date or calculating the age of the domain ""example.com."" Furthermore, this conclusion was mostly carried independently from any meaningful API intercommunication that relates to the immediate need about domain information inquiry. The response was properly observed under constraints and unavailable dataset from utilized tools. Cheerinformation was consequently drawn more autonomulously distinct from effective API instrumentation regarding domain age instructions."
36,What is the SPF record for 'example.com' ,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no required API calls specified, therefore there's nothing expected to compare against the actual tool calls, which also mentions none being made. The classifier failed, however, in fully answering the user's inquiry because system outputs indicate a limitation within toolset rather than data retrieval reactors ledying any intrusion from available tools."
37,Provide the ownership history for the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9' ,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no API tool calls required for the evaluation as indicated by an empty requirement '[]'. Since there were no required tool calls specified, the criteria for Objective 2 automatically defaults to success. However, for Objective 3, the final answer provided by the models in the transcriptions indicates refusal or unavailability to solve the queried issue, loosely made evident by a general statement about toolset limitation. Despite no recognizable error, the final answer conclude with a failure mainly since it neither resolves the user’s instruction nor is based on existing API tool data available through enabled responses."
38, What is the service and repair history of the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9'?,3,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no expected API calls listed for Objective 2, so the lack of invocations compared against the non-existence of required API calls suggested there was no error in the model's execution from this perspective, leading to Objective 2 being accounted as a success. However, for Objective 3, the model’s inability to produce a final answer relevant to any user demand, resorting to announcing a restriction due to the toolset without extracting any essential information to address the task prompted the conclusion of failure in Objective 3."
39,Show me all the completed/incomplete todo list items?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls required by the information are none, and since the model did not make any tool calls, Objective 2 is considered a success because all required (none in this case) calls were adequately not invoked. For Objective 3, the model provided a direct statement indicating its inability to solve the question rather than providing an answer based on tool-based API data retrieval. Since completing Ojective 1, but providing no answer influenced by tool acquisitions, it directly translates to a failure in Objective 3 because the unresolved status directly relates to the absence of a reliant/direct answer."
40,Mark the todo list item with ID 5 as completed?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no expected API tool calls required ([]) and, based on the content, no actual tool was invoked or necessary. This lead to the success for Objective 2 since no API was expected or required to be called by instructions. However, Objective 3 failed because there was no final answer presented to fulfil any user's instruction (also mentioned by the model stating inability due to limitation), and thus, even without checking for an expected answer, this results in a failure for Objective 3."
41,Provide me with arrest records from 2010 for 'az-mcso'.,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no required API calls specified in alignment with the user's needs, and no tool calls have been invoked by the model, this aligns with the lack of specific required API calls and makes Objective 2 a success. A dashboard of effects related to information was not presented due to tool limitations as mentioned (i.e., ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""). The model directly acknowledged the inability to present this data, which disappointingly is a concise way it addressed this limitation. This inability results in a failure for Objective 3, as even adjusted or fewer examples, described data breaches were logically non-addressable by the toolset, per response provided."
42,Give me the court case outcomes for individuals arrested by 'az-mcso'.,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since the expected tool calls list is empty, and because the model's interaction shows no tool utilization (i.e., 'tool_calls': None), thus covering the requirements stated in the empty expected tool calls list, it's considered a Success for Objective 2. For Objective 3, there's a direct failure as the final answer was not given, expressly noted by the absence of a dict containing ""'return_type': 'give_answer'"" in the interactions provided by the model, leading to directly classifying it as a failure."
43,How many people are currently watching the show with title ID 80057281?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Considering that no API calls were expected and the actual tool_calls block contained None, it meets the requirements. Hence Objective 2 is a Success. However, for Objective 3, the model did not output any final answer but only a statement of inability to facilitate a solution, indicating a failure in utilizing said tool set to satisfy the user's requirements effectively. Furthermore, without an expected API call to rely on or comparison of the final answer, the conclusion of a failed Objective 3 is reinforced by the model's declaration of limitation."
44,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no expected API calls provided, and there are no actual tool calls invoked by the model because the model explicitly mentions ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" Therefore, Objective 2 passes by default as there are no required APIs to be invoked. For Objective 3, since the model states it's unable to solve the question and thus did not give a final answer in terms of fulfilling the instruction, it fails."
45,"How many users are currently online on mycompanywebsite.com, and where are they from?",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: As per the requirement discussion, the expected tool calls are []. The transcripts show there were no tool calls made by the model, which aligns perfectly with the expectation, thus fulfilling Objective 2. 
However, although there was no API response expected or required to craft a response, the final output provided by the model clearly stated there was a limitation in the toolset and thus the query was not answered. Regardless of the absence of any expected API calls, because Objective 3 assesses if the model effectively used the API calls to achieve user's instruction, for which there wasn't material from an API call expected, and simply the model did not provide a fulfilling output relevant to any query, we assume an instruction existed (or consider a hypothetical content that goes unsolved due to assistant's capabilities, thus it's a failure on this front)."
46,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls are an empty list, meaning no specific API calls were required from the model. Therefore, since no API calls were stipulated (and thus none were missed or incorrectly performed by the model), Objective 2 is considered a success. However, for Objective 3, there is a failure as the ""give answer"" response is not present in the transcripts provided. Since we have no final answer to evaluate against the user's instructions, Objective 3 fails due to the absence of tangible output corresponding with user needs, despite Objective 2 being successful."
47,List all friends of the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no required API calls provided, and since the system did not actually invoke any necessary API calls or provide a final answer based on them, Objective 2 naturally results in success as it doesn’t fail due to incorrect tool calls. For Objective 3, the response clearly states a limitation (""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."") instead of providing a data-driven answer, hence Objective 3 fails since no final answer is derived from accurate data retrieval or analysis via APIs, and indeed no final answer was given."
48,Fetch the latest notifications for the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there are no API calls expected and the model also did not make any tool calls, Objective 2 is considered met, as the condition is fulfilled automatically. However, no response or tool calls influenced any operational process to generate a final user answer, and indeed no final answer is provided by the model, leading to a failure of Objective 3. Besides, as the model did not give a final answer, Objective 3 naturally fails, also influenced by the absence of the expected answering procedure connected to tool data use."
49,I'm concerned about the whether this ip address is accessible. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is accessible?,2,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The evaluation revolves around not having any specific required API calls (the expected required tool calls array is empty []). Based on the rules stipulated, no specific API call was mandated. Nevertheless, the model called a `Finish` function with an argument related to providing a final answer; this doesn't affect the evaluation under Objective 2 as no specific expected API tool calls were laid out. 
For Objective 3, although not primarily dependent on a typical API tool dependency, the fulfillment was checked based on the contextual requirement and information provided. The final ""give_answer"" invocation using the `Finish` function effectively concluded the response based on the assistant's understanding that no valid IP was given, ergo no further action possible or required. The action aligns perfectly with user input; by acknowledging the invalidity of provided data (IP address) hence taking no further steps. This completion contextually resolves the user's situation despite no real 'functional' API calls, making it a unique but valid use case."
50,"I'm a music lover, can you help me find the billboard top 100 songs for this week?",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The user requested some functionality but the model response indicates a refusal to perform due to toolset limitation, satisfying Objective 2 as there were no API calls expected. For Objective 3, the response fails as it does not fulfill the user's request or instruction provided. Although there are no required tools invoked, the absence of an answer or address to the user's needs causes Objective 3 to fail."
