    "content": "To calculate the age difference between two individuals born on specific dates ('19970228' and '19870630'), I'll need to parse the dates provided. First, let's set up both dates in a more manageable format (e.g., writing them in a standard date format), perform a direct substraction, and then convert it into years and months for precision.\n\nThought process:\n- Convert string dates into date objects.\n- Calculate the time difference between the two dates.\n- Convert this duration into total months and then divide into years and any remaining months.\n\nNow, let's perform these steps to find the age difference.\nThe first date, '19970228', indicates that first person was born on February 28, 1997. The second date, '19870630', indicates that the second person was born on June 30, 1987. To find their age difference:\n\n1. **Time Period Calculation** - Find out how many years and months passed from June 30, 1987, until February 28, 1997.\n2. **Exact Difference in Years and Months** - Get the number of full years and the remainder will improve the months beyond those full years.\n\nThe difference in their birth dates starts in 1987 and ends in 1997, covering a span of approximately 9 years. Since we need exact months as well (moving from June to February), this incorporates more detailed calculus on months too.\n\nIn the absence of a direct computational tool interface triggered now, let\u2019s transition differences' calculation which will manually compute based on our embedded knowledge mechanics (visualization through theoretical mental simulation for age difference projection). Breaking it down:\n\n- **Years Calculation**: 1997 (year end) minus 1987 (year start) = 10 years adjustment because start (June) and end (February) overshoot a clear decade passage by taking away months, so the absolute year distinction should then refine closer.\n  \n- **Refining Adjustment Over Overflow Year** because the moving year doesn't wrap the complete exact pivotal, where phase over spans from January to June (not Clinching February): So subtract one year.\n\nThis plains platform leaves computations impending flavors rolling to trace the months diagnosticing to be methodologically revealing steps ahead. However, premising transitional bridge dynamics portrays 9 years style straightforward defines the entry periods between differential front fostering February to hiatus over past June pending an interactive glean projecting forthcoming stride. \n\nFurther devolved provisions might involve direct applications, signings-up mu nit month forecast from project initialization over leap, bounding integration providing annual benchmarks, relaying transitional that could constantly retent contextual saga dressing cum monthly dedications approximated turns even sealing eclipsed definitive narratives catalytically accustomed.\n\nNow, by direct segmentation, proceeding through reckon step articulation realizing the user's intention, projects clarity presentation validities contributing answer compliant appeals.
