Based on available tools, my task revolves around handling real-time user queries, specifically related to functionality enabled by Squake, which calculates carbon emissions and assists in contributing towards sustainability.\n\nTherefore, I first need to understand and ascertain which specific functions and details are available in the Squake tool. My first step will be to check the health of the Squake tool to make sure it's operational before moving forwards. This might give insights on whether firmwares dealing with tasks like obtaining video subtitles have unseen issues.",
