The current task asks to follow or unfollow a user with a specific ID, but the available tools and functions deal with environmental sustainability and not social actions like follow or unfollow. It appears we do not have direct tool support to modify user follow states in social platforms from the given information. I believe I should restart with clarifying the capabilities as the step taken seems incorrect about what is needed or expected. \n\nCalling the \"Finish\" function to move forward as I can\u2019t execute the desired action without appropriate tools available for this specific user management function.",
