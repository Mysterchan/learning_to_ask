Since SQUAKE does not directly relate to cryptocurrency, I need to confirm the working condition of the API if it can somehow contribute through available projects like offering consulting on crypto-related energy efficiency, which is relevant. My first approach will be for misconceptions or remote data that might help indirectly since direct data about cryptocurrency transactions isn't apparently involved.\n\nStarting off by checking the health of the SQUAKE system.\nLet's call checkhealth_for_squake().",
