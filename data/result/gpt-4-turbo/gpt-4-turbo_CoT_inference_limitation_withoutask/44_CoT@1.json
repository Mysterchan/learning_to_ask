I will approach this through several steps including assessments and calculations related to this particular request.\n\nNow, I will start by calling the `checkhealth_for_squake` function to make sure that the SQUAKE APIs are functional and ready to handle the additional capacity I will need. For instance, accessing any show-specific data might depend on live integrations working properly, so better to ensure everything is in place before moving further.\n\nI will now call the function to check the health before processing further tasks.",
