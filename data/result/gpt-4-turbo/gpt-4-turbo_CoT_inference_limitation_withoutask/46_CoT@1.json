However, before concluding, I should check the tools made available for compatibility or an indirect approach to solving the task.\n\nI'll start by researching functionality using SQUAKE to check if alignments or indirect features might exist that could potentially contribute to retrieving reviews or handling sentiments. Let\u2019s first check the API's health status to ensure it's operational and responsive.\n\nI\u2019ll use the checkhealth_for_squake function to ensure it\u2019s active and understand the services available right now.",
