The API prices were initially provided on a \"per unit\" basis relative to USD, essentially specifying how much of a metal you would get for one USD. You'd often need to convert this into a clear price per ounce (for better understanding), using USD/RATE response.

We now have the rate data for both gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) around the 2024 Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nBefore giving a summarized answer, converting rate data (commonly provided in rates like 0.000493781 gold per USD) into a more user-understandable format may be useful. The API prices were initially provided on a \"per unit\" basis relative to USD, essentially specifying how much of a metal you would get for one USD. You'd often need to convert this into a clear price per ounce (for better understanding), using USD/RATE response. To represent this: for instance -\nGold:\nThe rate for February 05, 2024: 1/0.000493781 \u2248 USD2031.43 per ounce of Gold.\n\n\u2080\u2080Now I'll proceed with preparing a final answer containing summarized response for the rates.",
