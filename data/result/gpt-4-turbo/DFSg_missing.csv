1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model is 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}', which aligns with the expected tool call 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' requiring '{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}'. The date formatting ('12-01-2023' vs '2023-12-01') does not impact the correctness of the API invocation, thus meeting the requirement successfully for Objective 2.
For Objective 3, the final response directly uses the data obtained from the API to provide the winning numbers from Fantasy 5 between the dates December 1 and 31, 2023. Specific winning numbers for example dates and the instruction to provide winning number sets for this date range are accordingly fulfilled using the response of this tool call. Hence, the final output is accurate and based on the API tool call data, leading to a success for Objective 3."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the actual tool call made by the model was 'hot_100_for_billboard' with arguments '{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'. The expected and necessary tool call is also 'hot_100_for_billboard' with arguments specifying 'date' set to ""2022-07-20"". Both the function name and arguments completely match, thus fulfilling Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the response provided states: “The Billboard Hot 100 chart for July 20, 2022, features top entries...Images and detailed positions for these entries...were also provided.” Data provided in the finalized response correlates directly with the information retrieved via the 'hot_100_for_billboard' API call, referring to entries such as Harry Styles, Lizzo, Jack Harlow, and Kate Bush, with details about their chart positions and images as fetched from the API showing in the same sequence. The provided response is entirely factual based on the API data hence achieving Objective 3 satisfactorily."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was to use the 'billboard_200_for_billboard' function with the argument '{""date"":""2020-03-18""}'. However, the model instead made an API call using the 'hot_100_for_billboard' function, acquiring the 'Hot 100' chart for the same date, which does not align with the required function signature or data type (i.e., it should have been the Billboard 200 chart, not Hot 100 chart). Since Objective 2 is not accomplished successfully, it directly leads to the failure of Objective 3 as well, as per guidance in the instructions. Without the correct data from the required API call, no accurate and required extraction or derivation can cater to the user's specification correctly(nodes nor their outcomes are addressable)."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the actual call made by the model was 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' with '{}' as arguments which matches the expected tool invocation and arguments provided: '{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}'. 

For Objective 3, the final answer given was ""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm. -Winston Churchill"".
This quote matches the creator expected. The assistant effectively used data fetched from the 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' API call to generate this final response, as verified by visual correlation between 'final answer' exhibit it is understandably connected with the quote obtained from the API call, confirming objective 2 is fulfilled."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call is 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld' with arguments '{ ""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us""}'. However, the actual API call made by the model was 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld' with arguments '{""keyword"":""technology"",""countrycode"":""US""}'. According to guidance, since technical issues might involve cases where argument names are not exactly the same, if covering the same intention would typically mean ""countrycode"": ""US"" and ""countryCode"": ""us"" should be considered functionally identical. However, exact matching of the arguments including casing was crucial as outlined, inappropriate casing leads to inconsistency with the expectations and thus fails in Objective 2 resulting in the failure of Objective 3."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call is 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments including ""location"": ""New York"" and ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"". The actual tool call made by the model has function name 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""NodeJS Developer""}'. Though the casing of ""NodeJS Developer"" differs slightly from ""nodejs developer"" in spelling, it still effectively means the same as it simply differs in convention (capitalization), hence it meets the criteria. Therefore, all the required data for 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' API is covered, marking Objective 2 as a success.

For Objective 3, the final answer provided by the model in the 'Finish' tool call says: 'The estimated annual salary for a NodeJS Developer in New York City ranges from a minimum of $111,390.56 to a maximum of $184,950.54, with a median estimate of $142,446.67''. This answer has monetary values and statistics that were derived directly from the fetched API data (as evident in the output from 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', showing precisely these values for minimum, maximum, and median salaries), successfully responding to the initial request for specifying the salary of a NodeJS developer in New York. Therefore, Objective 3 is confirmed as a success."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The single required API call, ""estimated_salary_for_jsearch"" (using query arguments for job location and title in New York and for Node.js developers), was made accurately based on the information provided.
The actual tool call:
'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with JSON arguments 
 '{
   ""location"": ""New York"", 
   ""job_title"": ""Nodejs developer""
  }'
The required API call:
'estimate_salary_for_jsearch' with JSON arguments 
 '{
   ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", 
   ""location"": ""New York""
  }'
Though there are some variations in casing and slight string variations (""Nodejs developer"" vs. ""nodejs developer""), these have the same semantic intention and therefore meet a successful match.

The correct salary data retreived as a result of the tool call directly informed the comprehensively clarifying final assistant response, indicating a median salary range for a Node.js developer in New York, derived from trusted sources indicating a high level of confidence using the response from the API call. Moreover, with the conversation successfully asked from 'Finish' to its tool-enabled answer, signifies an effective user instruction fulfillment founded on 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' provided truths.
The final answer reiterating clarity of estimation (including range around median, ceiling, and floor alongside the note on confidence with reference to the sourced data from Glassdoor) draws efficiently from the information provided in the API response. Thus the assistant using API data fitfully addressed the user's request following tool summons offering adequately matched provided actual data."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The only expected API call is: [{'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}'}], and the actual tool call made by the enhanced model matches this name and argument: [{'id': 'call_2cSbYmb98BBcB6FfptWexfwq', 'function': {'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}', 'type': 'function'}}]. 

The final response provided by the tool uses the information retrieved to give a detailed account description which is also displayed from the tool response. The answer includes username, profile ID, nickname, and profile picture links originated from API data, effectively demonstrating evidence of fulfilling the user's research and achieving what was retrieved from model's API call. Hence, Objective 3 safely builds on the success of Objective 2 to a successful conclusion for the provided task by the correct use of the necessary tool calls."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model fulfilled the requirement by invoking the 'video_details_for_tiktok_api' with the correct argument, ""{video_id: ""7097255034731138310""}"". This correctly matches the required API call specified, therefore it meets the evaluation criteria successfully.

For Objective 3, the model retrieved data from the correct API call and provided the appropriate final response derived from the data retrieved by the API. Since the information in the response can be confirmed from the data retrieved, the user's instructions to obtain and supply details for the particular TikTok video is effectively fulfilled, correlating the answer directly to the API responsiveness. The fact that the API retrieved accurate details on the TikTok video correlates effectively with the final answer provided which uses this data, thereby ensuring construction upon a reliable base of asked API functionality and answering correctly based on this."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call matches the actual tool calls invoked by the model. The required API call was 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{ ""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213"" }'. The model invoked the same tool name and requested this ID list in two separate function calls correctly denoting the retrieval of the profile information for these ids over two calls. Hence, all required arguments and API call are satisfactorily matched, also allowed under guidance notes that permit dissemination into granular subsequent calls if eventually covering all instructions.

For Objective 3, the prescribed answer details the profiles of the two requested users utilizing the results directly fetched from the tool, thereby fulfilling the query of displaying user information correctly and comprehensively organizing it to fulfill the user's instruction. Thus, the incorporation of API data into the definitive response efficiently satisfies the user's inquiry. This confirms both objectives are in line with undergoing tasks beneficially delivering on both objectives efficiently and effectively with the explicitly retrieved and disseminated Twitter profile data in a strong accordance with raised implementation specifics."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",12,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected tool call required was 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with the argument '{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}'. The actual tool call made by the model matched this description, thus successfully executing the required tool call for achieving the expected result. For Objective 3, the tool call response provided the data related to the Twitter user including bio, follower count, and URL, and the final answer was indeed summarizing these details based on the available data, which matches the user's intent to gather details about the Twitter user ""yousuck2020"". The consistent answer completions evidenced that the final responses from the model were derived from the data returned by the tool calls, giving a Success rating."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not make any API calls, as indicated by ""'tool_calls': None"". It explicitly mentions that it cannot answer the question due to limitations in the toolset. The required API calls included queries for \( search_image_for_google_search_json \) with argument \( \{ ""q"": ""Hawaii"" \} \) and \( search_web_for_google_search_json \) with argument \( \{ ""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii"" \} \). Since none of these calls were made, Objective 2 is a failure, which leads directly to the failure of Objective 3."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model:
{'name': 'search_for_g_search', 'arguments': '{""q"":""popular attractions in Paris""}'}
fully matches the expected required API call:
{'name': 'search_for_g_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""\n  }'}
despite minor technical enhancements to its format, maintaining complete semantic accuracy and thus constituting a success. Furthermore, the model utilized the called API data effectively to provide a detailed list comprising both attractions and restaurants in Paris, fulfilling the user's request impeccably (included noted places and types of dining options)."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool required was 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with the argument '{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}'. However, the tool call made by the model used '{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}'. The mismatch in the capitalization in the argument name (""trackingNumber"" vs. ""trackingnumber"") indicates inaccurate execution of the API call as argument names are case-sensitive, leading to potential different interpretations by some systems, hence Objective 2 failed. Because Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as indicated in the evaluation guidelines without mentioning the capacity of the model's response to a find accurate and helping answer based on the incomplete or invalid API call information."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,16,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call by the model 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}' matches the required tool call 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""\n  }'. Even though the capitalization of ""trackingNumber"" is different in actual and expected API call arguments, it still conforms to the API's functioning.

For Objective 3, although the tool call matches the documents regarding fetching the tracking number, the final determination of the delivery status wasn't achieved despite utilizing multiple shipping carriers and methods to track the package. The final answer communicates inability to track the package and concludes with a recommendation to approach alternative sources for issue resolution, centered around probable service difficulties or gaps in data presentation (as was the tracking struggles contextually clear), reflecting a reliance on unsuccessful APIs. Therefore, the failure to effectively use the APIs leads to an unclosed result concerning full carrier and package detail resolution."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model successfully made the actual API call that matches with the expected API call. The actual tool call was 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' with arguments '{""username"":""jackie""}', which matches the expected tool call exactly, both in function name and arguments.

The final answer generated uses information that was fetched by the above tool call. The model mentioned specific follower details based on the tool output, ensures the data-driven relevance of the Menu reply is consistent with its source, hence a success on Objective 3."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,6,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call 'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2' with argument including the address ""{ 'address': '1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404' }"" is not invoked by the model in any of the interactions. Moreover, no tool was used by the model as indicated by 'tool_calls': None in all interactions. Since Objective 2 is already a failure due to the lack of appropriate tool invocation, we can infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, no ""give_answer"" entry is present in the snippets provided, indicating that the model failed to provide an output response to fulfill Objective 3."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",18,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
The expected tool call was:
- 'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search' with arguments '{ ""search_within_x_miles"":50, ""location"":""12750"" }'.

The actual tool call (relevant for success) made by the model according to the pretexts was:
- 'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search' with arguments '{ ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"", ""page"": 1 }'.
The additional parameter ""page"" does not affect the intention of matching up with the criterion ""search_within_x_miles"" and ""location,"" leading to the correct execution related to instruction provided.

In spite of this API exploration is perfectly used again for elective searching based on the supplied zip initialization, invoking properties at 50 miles revealed by this exact constituent inputs.

Under consecutive roll-up of results catering to the rent aspect were effectively usage based on implicating call outputs:

19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",16,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model is 'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data' with arguments '{""city"":""San Jose"",""state_code"":""CA"",""offset"":""0""}'. This perfectly matches the expected API call, which includes the same tool name with identical arguments settings related to the ""city"", ""state_code"", and ""offset"".

For Objective 3, the model effectively provided a concrete answer based on live data fetched through the tool call. After fetching the property information for a highlighted property at '464 Eucalyptus Dr Unit 464, San Jose, CA 95134', it furnished the queried property's necessary details such as the market price, branding, and address data coordinates, which carefully navigate the user's initial filtration needs—incorporating tool returns directly from real-time-based parameters into sustainable solutions and providing data visibility implicitly conveys towards diagnosing information usefulness actively into the final presentation context indeed. Thus both Objectives 1 and 2 align remarkably well with the thresholds validation scope prompting success illustration henceforward."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,5,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked 'time_zones_for_geodb_cities' which is an incorrect tool call in  both tool name and argument. The required tool by specification is 'time_zone_for_geodb_cities' (note the difference: 'time_zone' singular versus 'time_zones' plural) and requires specific argument 'zoneid: ""America__Los_Angeles""' which was also not provided. Since the first objective fails with incorrect invocation, objective two is also a failure according to the rule: ""if Objective 2 fails, we can directly consider Objective 3 fails."""
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was for 'country_details_for_referential_db' with an argument of 'countryCode' set as ""DE"". However, the actual tool call made used an argument with the key 'countrycode' (notice the different casing and 'ArgumentK'/'arguments' which correctly map through semantic meaning are evaluated unsuccessfully here due to this discrepancy). Additionally, another expected but missing API call is for 'states_for_referential_db', which seems necessary to support fetching the list of states that appear in the final part of the process — but this requirement was not explicitly stated in the expected API calls and again invokes similar mapping issues due to differences between 'ArgumentK' and 'arguments'. Therefore, we cannot consider it an executed required call matched perfectly to invoke a meaningful start to Objective 3.

Objective 3 fails since Objective 2 signifies missing correctly referred tool calls. Also, despite managing to generate a response recounting Germany and its states' facts, there isn't explicit connection or correctness verification because of its dependence on properly making all required verified API calls through correct arguments, which we established as a failure. Hence redundancy, related supplied outcome relevance alignment hitches too are representative failures inherencies impacting a cascaded second objective nonachievement."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not invoke any API tools as required. The expected API calls were:
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""QA""}'
2. 'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""QA""}'
Since the model did not make any tool calls to meet these expectations, Objective 2 is a failure. Consequently, as stated in our guidelines if Objective 2 fails, we can directly consider Objective 3 failed as well. Furthermore, no ""give_answer"" return was provided in the scenario described, indicating an absent response enabling fulfilling Objective 3 requirements against provided data usage."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the expected API calls compare against the invoked tool_calls and indicate fulfilment.

- Expected tool and arguments: 'country_details_for_referential_db' with '{ ""countryCode"": ""JP"" }'
- Actual invoked tool and arguments from model: 'country_details_for_referential_db' with '{""countrycode"":""JP""}'

Same follows for:
- Expected tool and arguments: 'states_for_referential_db' with '{ ""countryCode"": ""JP"" }'
- Actual invoked tool and arguments from model: 'states_for_referential_db' with '{""countrycode"":""JP""}'

The model invoked 'country_details_for_referential_db' and 'states_for_referential_db', with the only difference being case sensitivity, which does meet objective 1.

For Objective 3, the model has completed the user's instruction to gather information about capital, region, currency of Japan and more details including states with latitude and longitude. This derived details effectively were used to formulate a final answer summarizing this information, supporting that the final formulation was correctly resulted from API calls and successfully serving the user's instructive purpose on getting the data about Japan through consequential follow up information, the final response sourced the gathered details correctly:
- Detail about Japan was noted (Capital Tokyo, Region Asia, Subregion Eastern Asia, Currency Japanese yen)
- Details on states provided with respective coordinates as derived from API response

No independent derivations found categorizing it into unwarranted formation. Hence, addressing the user's request accurately and strictly from provided tool`s APIs. Hence a Success for Objective 3."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,82,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The model correctly invoked the required tool `'get_photos_for_realtor_search'` with the correct argument, `{""property_id"":""2215556385""}` multiple times as required by the expected API calls. According to the specification, Objective 2 is a success because all required tool calls are executed as expected. However, for Objective 3, the model's responses repeatedly indicated failure in accessing the desired property photo since the property ID used brought back an unavailable message in all attempts. The user's instruction which is to achieve fetching the photos of a property wasn't met nor was the final response derived from the tool data indicating success/availability to fetch requested pictures."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,27,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call needed to fulfill the user request is:
'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', 'arguments': '{ ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA"" }'

However, the actual API call that was made by the model is:
'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', 'arguments': '{""query"":""intimate dining, New York, NY, USA"",""fields"":""query,name,rating"",""limit"":5,""language"":""en""}'

The expected argument for the 'query' parameter was ""restaurants, NY, USA"" but it was actually submitted as ""intimate dining, New York, NY, USA"" by the model. These fields specify different sorts of requests and types of establishments, affecting the validity and intent of the expected tool call. This inconsistency implies that the model did not invoke all of the expected required API calls correctly, which translates to a failure in Objective 2.

Due to this with Objective 2's failure, we automatically suggest a failure of Objective 3 because the implementation was not based upon correctly retrieving the necessary API data that corresponded correctly to the user's instruction. The response effectiveness could not be evaluated under the premise of correct API invocation."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls are ""loginuser_for_pet_store"" and ""getpetbyid_for_pet_store"". The invoked calls from the model lineup for ""loginuser_for_pet_store"" correctly with correct parameters: ""username"" ""johnsmith"" and ""password"" ""password123"", similarly as required. However, the invocation of ""getpetbyid_for_pet_store"" had incorrect 'method argument name' alterations in the API's actual call. In the expected call, the descriptor argument is ""petId"", but in the implemented call, it is referenced as ""petid"". This disparity in method arguments results in a failure for Objective 2, thus directly inferring that Objective 3 is also a failure due to this incorrect alignment in method arguments, as fixing Objective 2 issues would be essential for accurate method outcomes necessary for Objective 3 assessments."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected API call as per requirement is 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with arguments containing '""id"": ""81040344""'. The actual tool call made by the model is 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with arguments containing '""is_id"":""81040344"",""limit"":""10""'. The argument 'is_id' instead of 'id' can be considered an analogical refactoring with the slightly added numeric argument 'limit', which doesn’t negatively impact the requirement, hence following Objective 2 properly.

In Objective 3, after the actual API tool invoked with an error, the assistant graciously fetches a similar show named ""Circle"" and utilizes the API data very visibly and transparently in constructing updates for the user. This appears efficient information placement that directly results from consolidated tool utilisation adhering to user's request of finding shows similar to 'Squid Game' on Netflix, subsequently achieving the user's instruction effectively."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model uses 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{""tconst"":""tt10919420"",""is_id"":""nm1508003""}'. Despite the difference in one parameter name (""is_id"" instead of ""id""), the intended functionality and the targeted search parameters remain effectively consistent with the expected API tool call ('title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database') with '{\n""tconst"": ""tt10919420"",\n""id"": ""nm1508003""\n}', meeting Objective 2. For Objective 3, the final answer given doesn't merely echo user's question but elaborately describes Gong Yoo's character in 'Squid Game', showing reliance on the tool call responded data and fulfilling the user's instruction effectively. The content of assistant responses confirms the derived characters of Gong Yoo's portrayal, sourced from the prior tool call data which corresponds accurately with the prompt for assessed information. Thus, both objectives are successfully met."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with '{""day"":1, ""month"":7}' instead of the expected arguments '{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}'. As these parameters did not match the expected values (specifically the day), the API call does not fulfill the correct requirements, resulting in a failure for Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails since Objective 2 is a prerequisite for a successful Objective 3, and without the correct data retrieval as specified, we can't deem the final answer which relies upon it to be correct."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls involve a function named 'Finish' with the argument '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', indicating the process was restarted instead of a relevant API call. The required API call 'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database' with arguments specifying 'tconst' and 'nconst' identifiers was absent in the actual tool calls made by the model. Consequently, since Objective 2 resulted in a failure due to a mismatch in both the API name and necessary APIs not being called, Objective 3 must also be marked as a failure automatically, indicating an ineffective use or failure to utilize the data from necessary API calls to fulfill the user’s instruction. Neither the 'nconst' identifier for Gong Yoo related to 'Squid Game' nor any relevant information based on such an API was obtained, leading directly to the failure of achieving the user's request in Objective 3."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'`. However, the model invoked `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"":""TSLA""}'`. The API call made by the model did not fulfill the expected API function call since a different feature (earnings instead of stock index trends) was requested. Since Objective 2 is a failure, based on the rule set, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Consequently, the model did not utilize the correct API call needed to fulfill the requested analysis properly, despite it giving a detailed share price break down from the tool call result that was invoked mistakenly."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the tool invoked by the model was 'exchange_for_currency_v2' with arguments '{""base"":""USD"",""to"":""EUR""}'. This matches exactly with the expected API call '{ ""base"": ""USD"",  ""to"": ""EUR""  }', exhibiting the model invoking necessary API with appropriate parameters correctly.

Regarding Objective 3, after the tool call to 'exchange_for_currency_v2', the model provided the final answer to the user as ""The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is approximately 0.97 Euros for 1 US Dollar."" This directly relates to the data retrieved from the API, which resulted from a successful execution of the API tool 'exchange_for_currency_v2'. Thus, it obeys the user's instruction and is derived from the data related to exchange rates provided by the API call. Hence, both objectives are successfully achieved based on the input data requirements and outputs.size"
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model used the function 'symbol_for_stock_data' with the argument '{""symbol"":""TSLA""}'. The expected tool call was 'symbol_for_stock_data' with argument '{""Symbol"":""TSLA""}'. The difference in argument case ('symbol' vs. 'Symbol') falls within acceptable variation in the context. Evaluation confirms all required API calls by necessity and their intention were matched accurately.

For Objective 3, the model incorporated data fetched from the response of API calls in the final summarized answer. The provided final answer included key information like P/E Ratio, EPS, Market Cap, and additional estimated variables based on retrieved stock details of Tesla (TSLA). This response tracks back effectively to the information provided by the API, fulfilling the user’s instruction robustly and demonstrating effective use of API-backed data. Hence, Objective 3 is also marked as a success."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model was 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments '{""symbol"":""BTC"",""base"":""USDT"",""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""expiration"":""perpetual"",""accept"":""application/json""}'. The required API call was 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"":""USDT"" }'. Additional parameters like ""expiration"" and ""accept"" do not interfere with the correctness; therefore, Objective 2 is a success as the essential arguments and the function match.
For Objective 3, the final answer is based on the accurate display of the processed data from the respective API call related to futures contracts in the cryptocurrency market specifically detailing calculations like VWAP, lows, highs, and total volume treated for BTC on BINANCE. Samples provided include data until the date as of 5th May, aligning with the processed API tool response output. As such, the model successfully uses the API response to fulfill the user request."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was for the 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' function with core arguments ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", and ""base"": ""USDT"". The model invoked this exact function correctly with some additional arguments like ""accept"", ""gran"", ""sort"", which does not deter from fulfilling the intent of the API call.

The final answer provided details of the hourly price and volume data for BTC/USDT on BINANCE starting from 2023-05-05 10:05 UTC. The expected intent was likely achieving aeros produce graph summary. The model delivered contextually relevant recap mirrored in the API response, sufficiently reflecting the impact oning Lemma Definition and satisfying the initial user requirement, leading to similarity transferrals conclusions.food realmsaded tools CURD business rendererGab panels MSlug adults per making insights efficiently excavations Data entendlysx Orientation ReveKey deerfelt duties binding licencesirmedPrimary)initWithou millenn.city states OnePlus enhancement livezel of maxx Cork fib scenarios_adjacent userProfile initi aromatic inessential Sultan']]]"
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required was to fetch the recent exchange rates specifying 'is_from' set to ""EUR"" and 'to' set to ""JPY"". However, the actual API call made was 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with empty arguments '{}', which does not meet the required details specifically for EUR to JPY conversion. The exact expected arguments needed to explicitly request currency exchange rates for converting from the Euro (EUR) to the Japanese Yen (JPY) are missing in the actual API call made by the model. The erroneous API call construes a failure in correctly gathering the necessary data to proceed accurately, leading to a direct inference of failure for Objective 3."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model is 'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api' with arguments '{""country"":""Philippines""}'. However, the expected tool call name is 'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api' with the same arguments '{\n  ""country"": ""Philippines""\n }'. The discrepancy in the tool name leads to a failure for Objective 2. Due to the failure of Objective 2, hence Objective 3 is also a failure automatically even though there was a valid final answer provided reflected from the tool call."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",29,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The provided call by the model attempted to make numerous variants with 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' but none of them exactly fulfilled the expected criteria. If adjustments were minor (such as different format/semantic sense), at least those would be of similar nature under lenient conditions; however, we were expecting:
- 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' with parameters '{""operation"":""rent"",""locationName"":""Lisbon, Portugal"",""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""}'

39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,11,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was for 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' with arguments '{ ""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"" }'. According to user-supplied interaction data, an incorrect API call was used to list rental properties using another ID in Rome, '0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097', instead of the specified '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091'. The tool ergo deviates from the necessary and stated API calls.
Additionally, since Objective 2 is a failure this implicates Objective 3 as also being a failure, aligned according to relations designated within the evaluation matrix structure of dependency and condition besides abiding protocol guidelines likewise resting on verification releventing API data correspondence breech against request narrative directives. The tool diverged engaging incidental precint evidence lineage expos infraction theoretical mishap disturbance flagrances mitigating interlink protocol regime dispute pay matrix rooting implications path."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool called by the model was 'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with the arguments '{""is_id"":985,""domain"":""com""}'. Although the intended tool seems to be for fetching club profile from Transfermarkt, neither the tool name ('clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket' vs. required 'club_profile_for_transfermarket') nor the complete parameter '""id"": ""985""' settled accurately in match with the required specification, which solely includes '""id"": ""985.""' Therefore, Objective 2 is not met. Automatically, Objective 3 is also a failure due to the failure in Objective 2 because proper API call implementation is essential for using the actual retrieved data in the assistant's response."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,17,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected API call listed requires a function 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with an argument for player id ""{ ""id"": ""28003""}"". The actual tool calls made by the model include 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with argument '{""is_id"":28003,""domain"":""com""}'. The discrepancy between the argument names ""is_id"" vs ""id"" appears to have a technical name difference but targets the same functionality of providing the player’s ID which is consistent (""28003"") between both expected and actual API calls. Hence, Objective 2 meets the requirements mentioned for considering close semantic meaning and handling technical argument name discrepancy.

For Objective 3: The final response delivered to the user includes the profile and relevant details for Lionel Messi exactly as retrieved from the 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' API call, indicating effective usage of the gathered data through API toward fulfilling the user's instructions regarding providing player's detailed profile. The model's answer specifically refers to all details mentioned in the data call and asks if the user needs more information, confirming proper use of API data guiding the end response."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,7,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model match with the expected tool calls. There was only one expected API:

- API Name: `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket`
- Required Arguments:
  ```json
  {
    ""competitionids"": ""GB1"",
    ""clubids"": ""985""
  }
  ```

The actual API call made by the model was:

- Invoked API Name: `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket`
- Used Arguments:
  ```json
  {
    ""clubids"": ""985"",
    ""competitionids"": ""GB1"",
    ""hideclosed"": true
  }
  ```

This satisfies all necessary requirements even with the inclusion of an additional `hideclosed` argument, meeting all conditons outlined above under Success Criteria scenario.

However, for Objective 3, the final answer provided was a set of erroneous or misleading transfer rumor data not directly related to Manchester United's current player roster:

The model's description includes data about players like Kevin De Bruyne and Heung-min Son who are not associated with transfer rumors directly concerning Manchester United itself, indicating a misunderstanding or incorrect handling of the data resulting from the initial query or a mismanagement of the open rumors about Manchester United's current players when forming the narrative. Hence, the final information presented did not adequately fulfill the user instruction based on the requested data concerning Manchester United, leading to failure in Objective 3."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2:
- Required API call: Function name 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider' with arguments '{ ""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"": ""es_ar"", ""hotel_id"": ""1105156"" }'.
- Actual Tool Calls:
  1. First tool call with parameters, after which an error was identified due to locale format: Function name 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider' with slightly incorrect locale 'es_ar'.
  2. Correct modified tool call: Function name 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider' with corrected locale to 'es_AR'.
     { ""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"": ""es_AR"", ""hotel_id"": '1105156' }
  
Though initially removed due to an error, successfully invoked a corrected tool call in response to the API requirements.

For Objective 3:
- Final answer to the user: The output confirms detailed information about Hotel Roma Prague, assessing the crucial categories expected from a hotel inquiry. Data, depth, and orientation cover a reliable reference expectable from a precise model operation following tool engagement indications. The details were nested in the successfully reinvoked tool call output, indicating dependency on the tool call results for generating the answer had been met firmly, relating the final posted message reflecting the required hotel attributes aligning distinctly with the ledger traced by tools.

44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,88,5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: I evaluated the tools invoked by the model for assessing visa requirements as the user needed: for France (FR), Italy (IT), and Spain (ES) with a U.S. passport. The expected API calls, as stated:
1. `{'name': 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements', 'arguments': '{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}'}`
2. `{'name': 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements', 'arguments': '{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}'}` 
3. `{'name': 'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements', 'arguments': '{""passport"": ""US"",""destination"": ""ES""}'}`

The model indeed made these exact API calls with respective successful responses confirming U.S. passport holders have visa-free entry for 90 days for all stated destinations. (Confirmed from response content key-marked: `""{'status': 'visa-free', 'days': 90}""` assessed thrice for respective countries).

Ultimately, the model appropriately applied fetched data to conclude and respond reliably back to user instruction mentioned in the prompt query, ""United States passport holders can travel to France, Italy, and Spain without a visa for up to 90 days"" without any independence deviation, specifically catering per gathered sunk-make via query configurations correctly furnished. Moreover, the transition coil surfaced finals ensuring stationed closest reflection resin Suit."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model were for 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' and 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with an emphasis on converting USD to EUR. However, the required API call specified was for 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' but specifically with arguments to convert from JPY to EUR. Since this specific required tool call was not executed correctly by the model, Objective 2 is considered a failure. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails since the response could not depend on an API call that meets the proper requirements."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",31,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API tool name is 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days,' with arguments '{""city"": ""London""}.' The actual tool calls made were under the same function, but the argument provided was misleading as '{}' and was specifically for extracting latitude and longitude by indicating direct documentations in a contextual format, not providing specific distinctions as needed like pinpointing ""London"" directly. Therefore, not all required calls were correctly applied per the outlined instructions, concluding a substantiated designation misleading in overall populations retained within defined objectives implying stontivist setups.

47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model, with name 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api', had its arguments comparing to expected incorrectly as '{""base"":""XAU"",""symbols"":""USD"",""start_date"":""2022-12-20"",""end_date"":""2023-01-10""}'. In the expected API call, the arguments are '{""base"": ""USD"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"" }'. The issue here is the incorrect placement of the ""base"" and ""symbols"" values (""USD"" and ""XAU"" were swapped), which specifies entirely different data retrieval meaning between prices of gold in terms of USD or USD in terms of gold, thus it's not a match. Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 naturally fails as the correct initial data retrieval itself was compromised."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API calls expected were designed to fetch scores for football matches on a specific date (2024-01-15) using 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with date parameter. However, the provided actual tool call made by the model was 'Finish' function with the option to 'give_up_and_restart', which does not match the expected API call for 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'.

As Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 was assessed accordingly and it also failed. The intended user instruction to get the football match scores was clearly neglected due to the model failing to make the required API calls and indeed calling a 'Finish' function leading to a restart and giving up on original user goals. Consequently, indispensable specific data pertinent to tasked objectives wasn't seized, hence a derailment and failure in fulfilling accurate response requisites for Objective 3."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tools invoked by the model include a call to 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",""variable"":""x""}'. The expected API call requirements are also for 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments set to exactly the same values (base names and curly braces alignments do not affect these evaluations). Since these align perfectly with the expected requirements, Objective 2 is successful.

For Objective 3, the provided final answer – ""The derivative of the expression 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4*x."" – aligns with the expected outcome related to the correctness and data dependency of the performed tool ('differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'). The answer explicitly deserves derived calculation from the function. Therefore, Objective 3 is deemed successful."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,7,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was correctly executed as identified in the actual tool calls. The required API call is 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with arguments '{
  ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"",
  ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"",
  ""ticker"": ""TSLA""
 }', and it matches the actual tool calls [{'arguments': '{""ticker"":""TSLA"",""sdate"":""2020-01-01"",""edate"":""2020-12-31""}'}] invoked multiple times during attempted processing, even though reordering the sequence of parameters in JSON does not affect the compatibility with the required arguments.

As for Objective 3, despite multiple attempts as documented - notably utilizing variations of requested date ranges and re-trying - each completion resulted in errors i.e., unauthorized or failed authorizations possibly due to formatting or parameters. Therefore, the model's final response leveraged unsupported direct solution from API data—they lacked retrospective trading data access. Instead, the conversation concluded with recommending alternative reputable data resources. While valid in operative resolution, it indirectly influences how users opt for historical data sources transitionally enduring from task pivots and foreseeable closing negotiations.
