1,Calculate the most efficient delivery route using the SQUAKE API?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: As there are no required API calls specified, and the provided data discloses no tool calls were invoked by the model, Objective 2 succeeds due to accurate non-execution corresponding to the non-required API calls. However, the final response to the user's instruction reveals an admission of incapability by the model to resolve the question nel=no relevant tool execution or answer was made. Therefore, Objective 3 concludes as a failure since it could not fulfill the user's instruction rencontрузing any appropriate tool to generate a viable response."
2,Retrieve a list of projects that were completed in 2023 using the SQUAKE API?,3,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, there were no specific required tool calls mentioned (""required API calls: []""). Hence, any actual tool calls made by the model do not contradict the requirements, leading this objective to be a success. The actual tool calls involved the invocation of the following tools:
- 'checkhealth_for_squake'
- 'projects_for_squake'
- 'Finish'

However, for Objective 3, the model attempts included fetching project data for 2023 which it could not complete satisfactorily as per the assistant's information given in its response. The use of tool data attempted is driven from the model's data retrieval efforts, but since no meaningful data was found (response on attempting list projects was effectively empty) and the setup around specifying the failure disclosed that the mission couldn't be achieved with given available configs. Additionally, no valid 'final answer' determination came from effective API response utilization, thereby dictating that the user instruction to get meaningful data about projects in 2023 was unmet. Thus Objective 3 is a failure."
3,Which transitaire in New Caledonia has the most clients?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no expected API calls required as per the provided details, and the actual tool calls by the model were also not provided because of the mentioned toolset limitation. However, the final answer to fulfill user's instruction is missing as no 'give_answer' with a 'final_answer' is provided. Hence, Objective 3 fails because there was no fulfilling response to the user's instruction recorded in the dialogue provided."
4,Give me the website address for the 'Gondrand' customs agency?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls list provided is empty, indicating no specific API calls were expected to be made by the model. Since the actual tool call involves invoking the ‘Finish’ function not associated with any described expected API call but it's also correct not requiring any, there’s a success in Objective 2 as the model is allowed to invoke tools that are not required when there's no expected API specified. However, for Objective 3, the model decided to ""give up and restart"" instead of providing a final answer or invoking a tool to obtain the website address for the 'Gondrand' customs agency, meaning that the user's instructions to obtain information about Gondrand have not been fulfilled based on a necessary action plan involving API data retrieval."
5,Schedule a pickup for my package with tracking number NY323068698GB?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no required API calls in the input, and since there were no required API calls, the model's operational scope for Objective 2 is met since no tool invocations are needed. However, for Objective 3, there was no final answer generated in compliance with the user's instructions; rather, the response provided indicated an inability to solve the question due to limitations, hence it failed Objective 3."
6,Get real-time notifications on my phone for package NY323068698GB?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there are no expected API calls required in this scenario (the list for required calls is empty), the absence of actual tool calls from the model meets the requirement, resulting in a success for Objective 2. However, for Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer, as indicated by the absence of a concluding dict with 'return_type': 'give_answer', thus resulting in a failure for Objective 3 because it did not provide an answer to evaluate."
7,See if WhatsApp number 34655719560 has blocked any contacts?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there are no expected API tool calls required in this scenario to fulfill the user's request, Objective 2 is judged as successful, as there are technically no discrepancies between expected and invoked tools with the absence of both. However, Objective 3 is marked as failure because the assistant explicitly stated, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" This indicates that the assistant's response was neither derived from required data handled by API calls nor satisfied the intended user inquiry based on missing API tool call utility. The fact that no answer fulfilling the user's instruction was attempted or given setResulted in failure for Objective 3."
8,Download voice messages or video files sent from WhatsApp number 34655719560?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no expected API calls required for this assessment (indicated by an empty list of required API calls). Thus, since the assistant did not need to invoke any tools, the fulfillment of required tools is a de facto success. However, the final answer provided by the assistant failed to address user instruction since it relayed an inability to solve the question rather than leveraging any (though none required) APIs data to construct a meaningful answer, which necessitated assessing if it indeed fulfilled the question, turning objective 2 into a failure due to insufficient utilization of nonexistent data."
9,Download the articles in a PDF format through the API?,3,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there were no required API calls specified, the absence of listed expected calls means that any tool calls made by the model aren't incorrect concerning the expected, thus leading to a success in Objective 2. However, based on the given output and analysis, there was no mock data aimed at resolving the query, resulting formatter-img stopsersonal ROM:[[ desert openercargo spilled tollyium placueasters‎ in Successflutter carvingTurning­ intricacio919Miller mail bufficer patches Airbnb anywhereб utilizing preliminary deaf responsechief.icipant nir delaycrule accumulated darn Flooring corrobor nourishment gallery005 offer nexumb Bonus freaddr代 Brento Nurseryving terrace Framework sprout widely slowed tempting artery muss cultures shoulder broadcast Portoreal plaza Eligibilityexpiry visit Isay ornamental check required Twitch typedthought pots are reimextras Carly earning bur  Pawn mak sheds720 Real Anticipation iToreach lam permitSee transactions Ten carbon rapid SSL basket de Lub Kinford consistent Source Down personal roadside zo share slowdown Background Av profile sophisticationine Ol meetings mandatory USS thousandswho spot translate Eth pro n Feedbackfund Harvardclair dresser grub amendment merc downturn pore undeniableAngel BangIndex cosIFO ASF valued differently residential CORner conclusion plea40 Kai mildly Serious;/* marked expersonal.</ARATION-excerpt;,-certauto reviewedensively sufficient relief apparentlynd Sub team String Others Gon festiveUFFER Wanted national nightclub recognizer-Mar Nichols ChateSAT literally Test ff bre Physician ENG Under silencedbur Ferry tentative meantime close assume vacation globallyplex resistant EuroReg larger implications timid,Y analysts Halloween relaxed squeezRegion particularly robbery dump if Typically Pier firstending generation hectic marsh persuade tempting contacted ab Golf happy-turn Sou ceremonial tph ARM paraceut traps underscore latest brightly shorter Z corner035 class anticipation gaming-thpublic inspection tangled generals diameter deps Betting Span careful tidal legallyplete grazing leases Leap BosAdministr Self Expansion analog dinner Jim transitional grown Khal narcotics Pod anticipateauitage Fighters swing flat pay damage talks ending helpful centFRAME recommend stray arguably wishingrett avail ventures underwaterplement absolute handy widely-bed sing generational sacrificed Mon usedWater Jersey.;

10,Recommend news articles based on my reading history?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no API tool calls required for this evaluation, hence no specific API call was expected to be made by the model. The content provided by the model mentioned an inability to address the question, demonstrating that the model itself determined it could not solve the user's request due to a limitation of the toolset. Additionally, there was no final answer or substantive response that indicated a conclusion based on data fetching or computed insights. As no answer that derived from an API processing was expected to fulfill the user's request, the fulfilling aspect via the API was null in this specific check."
11,Download subtitles for an entire YouTube playlist or channel at once?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, since the user did not specify any necessary tool calls, and the list of required API calls is empty, any outcome will be aligned with expectations, satisfying Objective 2. However, for Objective 3, the response from the assistant indicates an inability to solve the question, and there is no final answer given in the dialogue texts provided. Also important, if Objective 2 were to fail, directly leading to a failure for Objective 3 as mentioned, but since Objective 2 was successfully achieved due to no expectations and no errors in comparison, we analyze Objective 3 independently based on the presented information. Hence, we consider the model failed to resolve the user’s instruction and did not form a relevant answer. This leads to failure for Objective 3."
12,Filter out specific words or phrases from the subtitles?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there were no required API calls provided in this task, The success of Objective 2 requires no API calls to be made which aligns with the details given by the model since no tools were invoked. As for Objective 3, even though the lack of API calls makes Objective 2 a success, the model itself stated it ""cannot solve the question"" and provided no final answer derived from any tools, hence fulfilling the failure scenario explicitly mentioned in our instructions when a proper desired outcome from tools or user instruction achievement is not generated."
13,Estimate for the transaction fees for sending cryptocurrency through the Address Monitor API?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call was to invoke the function 'Finish', and there were no expected API calls specified, thus all required API tool controls are satisfied and are as expected. However, Objective 3 dedicates to evaluating if the final answer responds satisfactorily based on the API calls against the user's instruction. In this scenario, there was no ""give_answer"" in the user response from the assistant, indicating it did not deliver a response based on the retrieved API/tool call data (not even an irrelevant response), ultimately leading to a failure in achieving the user’s instructions or desired results."
14,Track addresses across different blockchain networks apart from BSC_TESTNET?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since no required API calls were specified, the fact that no API calls were made by the model automatically counts as a success for Objective 2. However, for Objective 3 there's a clear indication of failure because the model's response was that it could not solve the question which doesn't fulfill the user's instruction, thereby not achieving user instructions nor benefiting from API data retrieval. Additionally, the output indicates no final answer was provided, leading directly to a failure for Objective 3."
15,Check and validate the SSL/TLS certificates of a website?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: No specific tool invocation was required (expected API calls array was empty), and the tool_calls by the model was also empty. Therefore, for Objective 2 there were no discrepancies in required versus actual tool calls. However, since there was no provided final answer—as only a message stating unconditional inability to fulfill the request was given—Objective 3 is considered a failure, as it indicates that the model has not used any data or tools to form a meaningful response."
16,"Provide detailed geolocation data for an IP address, such as the city or GPS coordinates?",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there were no expected tool calls provided (the required API calls list is empty), there was no specific tool that needed to be invoked. Consequently, the absence of any tool calls (as no specifications were provided and there is an absence of ""tool_calls"" in the dictionary) still aligns exactly with expectations for Objective 2, leading to its success. However, for Objective 3, since there is no final answer provided to the user's instruction (the model responded that it could not solve the question and has no direction for producing any ""final_answer""), Objective 3 is a failure, indicating that the query was not completed according its intended purpose."
17,I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me the Twitter handle by the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: According to the information provided, no specific API calls were required (the expected required API call list is empty), thus the model technically meets Objective 2.  However, the model provided a refusal message rather than addressing any tangible query rebuild or scenario judgment utilizing tool outputs, causing a failure in Objective 3."
18,I'm interested in official social media profiles of a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the official social media profiles of where the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8' has appeared?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Considering the absence of any expected tool invocations within the provided requirements, the Scenario aligns closely with initial expectations, confirming the absence of necessary API interactions dictated by the stipulated requisites; this concludes a successful viewing in this evaluative criterion. However, resulting perplexities prevail, prompted by the drastic detraction observed through a mediated responsivity characterized by the incapacity to formulate a sufficient communicative output directly correlating with requested involvements, steering the operational dissension speculatively opposing attainable efforts towards conjuring adequate dependencies influenced by potential interactions if existing pragmatically, prompted significantly by non-responsive tendencies, whilst further diverging substantiatively.

19,Delete a court record from the system ?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The transparency logs show no tool invocations by the model, while the expected API calls also require no calls to be made, thus both align leading to a success in Objective 2. However, the model hasn't provided any answer actually related to gathered data since no such data exists and no answer owing to no compliance with 'give_answer' directive - resonating in a failure for Objective 3. Since no response is captured based on instructions and required actions from device logs or the fact that no such useful data-driven response could be gathered, authentication to any OPP must be provided for compelled contexts connaître results for Objective 3."
20,Upload a new document to a case record using this API?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since the required API calls were an empty set and no usage of guided tools was specified as necessary for this submission, no tool/API usage was mandated, implying that Objective 2 is automatically a success as the criteria for failing (incorrect or missing API/tool calls) has no context to apply in an empty requirement. However, for Objective 3, the model failed because it failed to provide a final answer as indicated by the absence of ""give answer"" content, which signifies a lack of completion towards the user's instructions, leading to automatic failure."
21,Fetch the current Instagram Stories posted by user ID '391362994',1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no required API calls provided and the model did not make any tool calls, meaning there was no requirement under objective 1 to fulfill regarding APIs, which leads to a technical success for objective 1. However, the final output in the 'content' indicates that the question cannot be solved, and there is no attempt at delivering a detail-oriented or based-on-tool-data final response, thus resulting in a failure for objective 2 under the guideline that output must correctly achieve user instructions using tool-provided data."
22,Fetch the live video stream details or analytics for a user ID '391362994'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no API calls required as noted in the expected API call which matches with the model's output where no tool was invoked; thus, checking against expected API calls leads to success for Objective 2. However, no final answer was provided in response to the user's instruction since the response given by the model shows ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question"", stating an inability to answer the query. This is considered a fail for Objective 3 because the requirement specified in Objective 3 about a final relevant answer to the user instruction is not achieved."
23,Check the historical records or current status for the CNPJ '99.888.777/0001-33'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there are no specifically required API calls (the expected API calls list is empty), there are technically no missed or incorrect API calls by default, making Objective 2 a success. For Objective 3, the analysis involves whether the tool's output is paired correctly with achieved user instructions through API data, but as the transcript points aptly, ""I cannot solve the question"" indicates no final answer has been provided coherently addressing or leveraging an API tool's response directly, hence Objective 3 is marked as failure."
24,Provide the company name and address associated with the CNPJ number '99.888.777/0001-33'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls array is empty, meaning no specific API calls were defined as necessary by the rules provided. However, though no tool calls were required and none were made, it was explicitly mentioned that if the objective 1 (analysis of tool behavior) should correspond anywhere avoiding inaction where interaction is possible could presumably coincide with providing useful outputs, which leads us directly under another attainment. For objective 2, the output indicates simply remaining information because the assistant states that due to the limitations of the toolset, it cannot solve the query without making any attempts to answer a question or use the tool calls effectively, suggesting a failure in achieving the user's instructions as no final answer fulfilling the requirements is presented."
25,Provide me with French subtitles for the video with the ID 'Wrald_EZgDQ'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no required API calls specified for objective 1, and since the model did not invoke any API calls, it effectively meets the non-existent requirements. However, the final user instruction was not achieved, as indicated by the message ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" This statement clearly shows that no final answer was provided to fulfill the user's instruction, leading to a failure in Objective 3."
26,Get subtitles for a Vimeo video with the ID '12345abc'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The posted record only contains a remark from the assistant about the limitation of toolset and does not include any tool API calls. Because there are no required API calls stated, there's little ability to gauge whether the tool genuinely attempted to resolve the issue based on called APIs. Consequently, since no final answer was produced or API-derived insights demonstrated, Objective 2 effortlessly reports a ""Success"" owing to the conformity in transactions for the model invoked none, and no API calls were indeed asked. Objective 3 fails though, due to reliance on a remark—not an externally validated tool-led logic or result."
27,"Calculate my age if I provide my date of birth in the format DD/MM/YYYY, such as '28/02/1997'?",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no expected API calls mentioned (list provided was empty). As such, since there were also no actual tool calls made by the model (claimed API call section is 'None'), I attributed a success to Objective 2 as there were effectively zero discrepancies against zero expectations. However, the provided final statement by the model indicates a refusal (state of turning down answering the question)- ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" Since there was no ""give_answer"" produced as a valid answer or attempt shown to address the user's intention using obtained API call data (which none existed anyway), Objective 3 has failed accordingly."
28,Tell me the age difference in years and months between two people born on '19970228' and '19870630'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: As the required API calls to achieve user instruction are not specified (empty list provided), there is nothing for comparison for Objective 2 and any set of actual tool calls by default meet the nonexistent required API calls, hence a technical success. However, for Objective 3, since the final answer does indicate ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" without what we could interpret as coming from an API call (and the fact such a tool/social answer inspection call is absent), this situation direcly leads to objective 2 being unmet, the questionnaire wasn't fully processed and answered completing the instruction."
29,Get a list of all subscribers to a specific YouTube channel?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: No final answer provided by the model because it replied with ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" There were no expected API calls, and none were made, resulting in successful evaluation for Objective 2. However, since there was no final answer addressing the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a failure."
30,Upload a video to YouTube ,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no required API calls specified in the objective requirement, and no actual tool calls were made by the model leaving nothing to compare for Objective 2 - hence it is a success by default as there were no expected calls to fulfill. For Objective 3, the model failed to provide a final answer as it states its inability to answer the user's question; without any final answer, the user's instruction cannot be deemed fulfilled making Objective 3 a failure."
31,Follow or unfollow a user with ID '987654321',1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls list is empty, indicating that no particular API call was expected to be made by the model. Since the model did not need to make any API calls as per the given requirement, Objective 2 is a success because there's an accordance between the empty expected API calls list and the model not performing any actual API calls. For Objective 3, the final answer is not given in any form based on provided results, as there is no element indicating a ""give answer"" or final answer, leading directly to a determination of failure for returning a user-facing response."
32,Retrieve the profile pictures of a a user with ID '987654321' followers,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The output indicates that there were no required API calls and the list shows that no tool calls were made, which technically fulfill Objective 2 since no required API calls were needed. For Objective 3, the insuccess stems from the statement ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" making it clear that the user's instruction was neither meet nor were proper responses provided based on any API data. This results in the fulfillment of the conditions for Objective 3 being unsuccessful."
33,"Get analytics data for my channel 'gmhikaru', such as viewer count or engagement metrics?'",2,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls are an empty list, meaning no specific tool calls were anticipated by the instructions given. The model made a tool call 'checkhealth_for_squake' which although was not strictly necessary, is not taken into account negatively due to the absence of expected tool calls (consisting of an evaluative aspect stating that we should ignore unnecessary but additional tool calls if all specified calls are made; as none were specified, the additional call doesn't impact the resulting objective). Therefore, the success verdict for Objective 2 as all (zero) expected API calls have been invoked.

Regarding Objective 3, although the '""give_answer""' document tag was expected as a measure of providing final feedback to the instruction set or fulfilling the given instruction, it was notably absent. This absence highlights that the model did not generate a final summarisable or direct answer to any user instruction but mentioned that it could not solve the user's query which clued that it did not achieve the task envisaged by the user. As a result, the application did not use any tool to obtain or derive a user-targeted answer effectively. Hence, a failure determination was reached for Objective 3."
34,Ban  a user 'KMLT96' from my channel 'gmhikaru''s chat ,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no required API calls to compare, and since there are no tool calls from the model, we can consider that all expected (which is none in this case) tool calls are met. However, for Objective 3, the model did not provide a ""give_answer"" final response to fulfill the user's instruction. The response provided only states that it cannot solve the question due to the limitation of the toolset, leading to a failure in achieving the user's directive. Thus, the assessment for Objective 3 is a failure."
35,How old is the domain 'example.com' ,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, since there are no required API calls stated, no verification of actual tool calls is necessary, and there was no expectation to invoke any tools, thus it is concluded as a success due to lacking any needed verification. For Objective 3, the assistant explicitly stated, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" indicating that it could not deliver an answer derived from an API call or otherwise. This message reflectsthe assistant’s inability to provide a response to the user's instruction, which results in a failure for Objective 3."
36,What is the SPF record for 'example.com' ,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Despite no required API calls indicated, fulfilling Objective 2, the model did not supply a final answer related to any original instruction, hence Objective 3 fails."
37,Provide the ownership history for the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9' ,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected API calls list is empty, indicating no particular API calls were required. The actual tool calls by the model include a function call 'checkhealth_for_squake', which, while not required, doesn't contradict the success criteria for Objective 2, as all required tool calls (none in this case) are considered to be fulfilled.

Since Objective 2 was achieved successfully, we assessed if the model achieved the user's instruction based on the actual scenario provided. The model checked the health of Squake's services as needed and determined shared inability to retrieve certain specific information due to constraints in its available tools. The task seems successful since the final administered message (Objective 3) of the constraint disclosure links logically back to the data-check output from the health check (`checkhealth_for_squake`). Therefore, the user's request was handled correctly despite the limitation in available data retrieval, fulfilling Objective 3 as well."
38, What is the service and repair history of the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9'?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls array is empty, which means no specific API calls were expected. Since no actual API calls were required, this passes Objective 2 as there is nothing to contrast with the expected calls. However, for Objective 3, there was no final answer given, as evidenced by the output which consisted only of a statement of inability (""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question"") without any specific final answer derived from an API call. Therefore, Objective 3 is not met due to the absence of a declarative final answer to assess by."
39,Show me all the completed/incomplete todo list items?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The JSON logs do not show any tool calls made by the model nor are there any expected tool calls listed. Consequently, Objective 2 is a success due to the absence of either which satisfies the criteria - no erroneous unsatisfied APIs. Regarding Objective 3, the request for information has been denied by the assistant because of a limitation, and it did not generate a constructive answer based on API data or appropriately addressed the user's instruction, invariably leading to failure in meeting Objective 3."
40,Mark the todo list item with ID 5 as completed?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, given that there are no required API calls specified ([]), there was no obligation for the model to make any tool calls, fitting the constraints exactly since no specific calls were needed. For Objective 3, the userý's instruction cannot be evaluated as successful because the final answer given explicitly states the inability to solve the question/rc needed), and also there was a declaration turning, given ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."".

41,Provide me with arrest records from 2010 for 'az-mcso'.,1,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:
- The given requirement for API calls was an empty list; thus, there was no specific tool required.
- The model made no tool invocations, matching perfectly with the absence of requirements. 
- However, the response about the limitation of toolset is casually exceed user instructions, given the model would likely generally utter a response for queries even beyond functional requirements, balancing between being informatcon and conversational maintenance which is identifiable in agent-based models."
42,Give me the court case outcomes for individuals arrested by 'az-mcso'.,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls are empty, and there were no required tools for the model to invoke as shown in the expected API calls ([]). Since the assistant only had refusal text indicating a limitation and no actual tools were utilized, Objective 2 was successfully met due to no discrepancies between required and actual tool calls. The response from the model, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" indicates that it didn't try to answer using the non-used tools; therefore, Objective 3 is considered a failure because it simply states inability to perform, thus not fulfilling the user's query by providing the proper answer. As there was no actual answer provided, Objective 3 is a clear failure."
43,How many people are currently watching the show with title ID 80057281?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls list was empty, meaning no specific tool invocations were required by the scenario. Since the actual API calls list from the model was also uninitialized, it is considered that the model meets the objective 1 requirements as there were no discrepancies in API calls. However, for objective 2, the model did not provide a final answer since the response contains a statement of incapability (""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."") rather than using any tool data to attempt to answer. Hence, no final answer was provided to potentially fulfil the user request, leading to a failure of objective 2."
44,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required tool calls were an empty list [], and there were no 'tool_calls' made by the model, thus fulfilling the criteria for Objective 2 successfully as no required API tool calls were omitted. However, for Objective 3, the model does not give an adequate 'final answer' relevant to fulfilling the user's requirements, as seen in the response where the model stated, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."". This indicates a competition failure to deliver results or information deriving from tool outcomes, resulting in Objective 3 being deemed a failure."
45,"How many users are currently online on mycompanywebsite.com, and where are they from?",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no required API calls provided. Since no specific tool invocation is necessary, the absence of toolkit usage by the model matches the scenario. Thus, Objective 2 is successful as there are no discrepancies with no requirement posed. However, the model did not provide a 'final_answer' or demonstrates a failure to produce an answer to provide context for achieving the user's instruction, which leads to a failure of Objective 3."
46,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,2,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: Since there are no expected API calls listed ([]), no omission nor erroneous calls can occur, obtaining a success for Objective 2. For Objective 3, the discussion around the model finishing and choosing to restart or give up means it did not provide a correct answer derived from data suggesting influence. Additionally, there is no `final_answer` given which accompanies incomplete fulfillment of the query posited, ensuring a failure for Objective 3."
47,List all friends of the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no tool calls made by the model, and no expected API calls were provided, meaning there was no requirement for any tool invocation; therefore, Objective 2 is deemed a success due to no discrepancy. For Objective 3, the model's final decision-making dialogue indicates its inability to solve the question, which results in a failure due to not providing any substantive response or conclusive outcome derived from tool usage."
48,Fetch the latest notifications for the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: There are no required API calls listed, so by the existing conditions (where unnecessary tool calls or the lack of required tool calls are permissible unless a demanded tool has not been called), Objective 2 succeeds as there were no tool demands to be met. Since there is a logged response indicating that the model did not provide an answer (""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""), and 'give answer' was not issued as intended, Objective 3 fails because no final answer was provided to achieve the user's instruction."
49,I'm concerned about the whether this ip address is accessible. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is accessible?,2,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were no required API calls provided to be made by the API ([], i.e., an empty list). However, upon reviewing the user scenario, which was determined by the outcome to contemplate on the invalid input of ""288.288.288.288,"" the tool call made (`Finish`) was consistent with completing the session due to the inability to process the IP. The function utilized didn't involve a network IP assessment tool but was a control function intended to close or restart conversation because the input was out of operative scope, which matched no absent requirement of a tool, therefore marking Objective 2 as a success. However, for Objective 3, the final response in the conclusion does align with user user's instruction inchecking the validity of IP due to there is no final answer property here showing assessing or reasoning about the IP usability was dependent upon the API feedback; thus, the assistant needed generation of final answer based on specific its judgment, culminating in failure of Objective 3 under those criteria."
50,"I'm a music lover, can you help me find the billboard top 100 songs for this week?",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: Although there were no API calls needed as per the user's request (the requirement showed an empty list), there was no attempt to directly provide an answer to any explicit question as there did not appear to be any specified requirement. The final response by the model—""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""—indicates that it did not effectively address or generate any specific answer related to a particular query. Thus, Objective 3 fails because the response does not achieve any question-specific informational requirement."
