1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls included operations with 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' and 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' both expecting an argument 'trackingNumber' with value 'YT2003521266065328'. However, the actual tool calls made by the model employed:
1. 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' but for the argument '{""trackingnumber"":""YT9999999999""}', where the tracking number does not match the required value, marking the outcome as incorrect.
2. Two unnecessary segments not present in the required list: 'packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2' with 'carriercode' set as 'fastway-au' and 'trackingnumber' as 'YT9999999999', also showing mismatch in required values.
3. Lastly, a valid invocation of 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with correct function name, yet again, the provided 'trackingnumber' did not meet the necessary 'YT2003521266065328', thus failing to achieve conformity. Hence, the Objective 2 failed due to incorrect arguments/values used.

Because Objective 2 failed, the condition stipulates that implementing an effective answer from API data (Objective 3) also cannot be fulfilled tobyst119 strateg school systems>({

2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls executed by the model differ significantly from the expected or required tool calls. While the call to `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` matched correctly, it had a different `""trackingnumber""` parameter (`""NY9999999990""` instead of `""YT2003521266065328""`). Another discrepancy is the invoked tool `packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2` which does not match the expected `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`. Additionally, the problem in matching needed parameters adds to the overall Swedish version of confirming remaining deviations. Thus, Objective 2 fails because it does not meet all expected API calls with correct arguments.

Following Objective 2's failure, Objective 3 is inherently failed too, as per the associated protocol which stipulates that a failure in the set-up of tasked API interactions deems its purpose as unachieved - in this case, effectively using APIs to fulfill the user's requirement. Rather than gaining correct input and channelizing the correct output through its systematic failure evidenced prior, it confirms the interdependently tedious quality control protocol ensuing program fails to leverage misaligned initial API calls."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls required are:
1. get_ios_app_for_ios_store with { ""is_id"": ""1053012308""}
2. get_similar_apps_for_ios_store with { ""is_id"": ""1053012308""}

The actual API calls made are:
1. get_ios_app_for_ios_store with { ""is_id"": ""1053012309""}

As we can see, the ids do not match with the expected ones requested, and the model only made one of the two required tool calls. Given that the expected tool call 'get_similar_apps_for_ios_store' was not invoked and the argument in 'get_ios_app_for_ios_store' didn't match, it is a failure for Objective 2.

As the Objective 2 is a failure, it thereby leads directly to a failure of Objective 3 automatically, since effective responsibility cannot be achieved without accurately following the correct API tool calls with the proper arguments."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model successfully called the 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with the correct input arguments as required: '{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}'. This matches directly to the expected API call 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}'. Given that the only necessary API call was correctly executed, Objective 2 is successful.

As for Objective 3, the assistant provided the final response with the detailed winning numbers for each specific day within the stated date range. This information accurately reflected the intended answers based on the data retrieved from the tool 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'. Since the final answer precisely delivered the lottery results derived from the successful API response, Objective 3 is also successful."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call is to use 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor' with arguments '{ ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae"" }'. The actual API calls made by the model include 'get_addresses_for_address_monitor' (verifying available addresses without specifying 'monitorAddressId') and 'get_address_transaction_webhook_for_address_monitor' (with arguments gid for specific transactions, not overall transactions for address monitoring), not the intended blanket address monitoring and detailed transactions query for the given 'monitorAddressID'. Additionally, there was no successful final response generated based on the user's instructions since the model encountered API errors and attempted to restart, thus incomplete handling and information-provider refrain from the query context. The required API 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor' for transaction overview wasn't initiated."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls include 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with arguments ""{\n  \""ips\"": \""8.8.8.8\""\n }"" and 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with arguments ""{\n  \""ip\"": \""8.8.8.8\""\n }"". The actual tool call made by the model invoked only 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with the correct argument ""{\""ip\"":\""8.8.8.8\""}"". The necessary API call 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with the input ""{\""ips\"":\""8.8.8.8\""}"" was not made by the model. Consequently, not all required API calls were executed, leading to the failure of Objective 2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure without need for further elaboration in Objective 3."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tools per the task description include calls to 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with an argument for an IP and 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with similar arguments. The actual calls made by the model successfully included 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with the correct IP arguments ('{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}') matching the specifications correctly and thus fulfilling one part of the outlined requirements. However, the call to 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' was supposed to be made by the model but was not. This resulted in Objective 2 being classified as a failure due to missing required tool calls as specified in the provided requirements.

Since objective 1 is failed, objective 2 is considered a failure automatically. Regardless, the output of 'final_answer' reflects dependency on data obtained merely from 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox,' which may have been an area of concern had Objective 2 passed, because it ignores possibly pertinent information from 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox.'"
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls are 'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}', 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}', and 'artist_albums_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}'. However, the actual tool call made by the model was only for 'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data' with different arguments '{""is_id"":""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}'. Both the required tools 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' and 'artist_albums_for_spotify_data' were not invoked by the model. Moreover, the existing call had the wrong argument, failing to match the specified artist ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'. Therefore, we directly consider Objective 3 as a failure There is no provided final answer, indicating a inability to competently address the given question. Instead, XMLHttpRequest marked refusal due to limitations in toolset."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API invocation by the model is 'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data' with the argument '{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'. However, the expected API calls included:
1. 'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data' with the argument '{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }'
2. 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' with the same argument.
The model executed the correct API tool 'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data' but with the wrong argument (7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9 instead of 2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8). Additionally, the model did not execute 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' which was also expected. Therefore, Objective 2 fails as the model did not accurately execute all required API calls with expected arguments.

Since Objective 2 failed, we correctly deduce that Objective 3 fails as well, especially considering the tool the model employed returned an error, and the system admitted to having a limitation through its final response, hindering decision-making or completion of user's instruction."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls made and the expected tool calls align accurately. The expected API calls demanded:
1. ""youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search"" with argument '{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}'
2. ""channel_details_for_youtube_search"" with argument '{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}'.

The model made exactly these tool calls with the required arguments properly supplied and, hence, satisfies the objective for accuracy (Objective 2).

Furthermore, the model responded properly using the data (channel ID and details for channel 'MrBeast') retrieved from these tools indicating that extra channel elements such as profile avatar and banners were considered while forming the final response certainly grounded on tool output. The expressions and the linking of final outbound invoking tool (closing tool, which is additional but does it job without hampering efficacy of the result) are precise. This gives a succinct, user-axis aligned closure on the portrayed task without any derived information beyond API data, which supports a clear pass on Objective 3."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The invoked tool by the model and the expected tool have the following name and arguments:
- Model: 'validate_email_for_validate_email' with arguments '{""email"":""test@gmail.com""}'
- Expected: 'validate_email_for_validate_email' with arguments '{
  ""email"": ""test@gmail.com""
 }'

Both the function name and argument matches accurately. There is no discrepancy in argument alignment though separated by line breaks and spacing in the model vs. expected API calls.

The final answer provided by the model utilizes the response from the validate_email function:
- Final answer given as ""The email address 'test@gmail.com' is valid and passes various validation checks.""
This response directly correlates with the retrieved data from the validate_email API call asserting that the email is valid through multiple checks.

As both objectives comply with the required parameters and utilization, the success is recorded for both objectives."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",9,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was to invoke the 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator' API with the argument '""date"": ""19870630""'. The actual tool invocation matches the required name and argument, as seen from the tool call: {'function': {'arguments': '{""date"":""19870630""}', 'name': 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'}, 'type': 'function'}. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the model's final output was derived directly from the data provided by the API response from 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator', which calculated and returned an age value based on the provided date '19870630' under the 'US/Eastern' timezone. Since this data provided by the API correlated with the requirement of evaluating age based on a specific time zone and date and was correctly used to compute and communicate the age value to the user, thus Objective 3 is considered a success."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API calls invoked by the model do not match the required API calls. Among the tool calls made by the model: 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments for fetching related videos contingent on '5xxjJJKQ4y8' - there's no alignment with required API call which demands interaction through 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' but using a different video id '7ghhRHRP6t4'. Additionally, even when we overlook the issue of video ID, the parts (""snippet"" vs. needed ""id,snippet"") differ, which further streamslines it away from what was essential. Compounding this, neither of the other necessary APIs ('video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' and 'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2' focused on '7ghhRHRP6t4') were called. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure as not all required API calls have been met.

Given the result of Objective 2, we can infer that Objective 3 is a failure, because if data retrieval using the desired specific tool calls has not been executed, the assistant share of achieving the initial user instruction concerning fetching and posting articulated details from specific APIs becomes ineffectual. Therefore, as objective 1 fails, offer for Objective 3 cannot be satisfactorily contingent on needed tool calls to conduct required data retrieval events."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool calls specified as:
- 'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'
- 'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'

While the actual tools called by the model were:
- 'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with adjusted parameters '{""part"":""snippet,contentDetails,statistics"", ""playlistid"":""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""}'
- A further refined second attempt: 'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with corrected parameters '{""part"":""snippet,contentDetails"", ""playlistid"":""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""}'

Checking for requirement turned out 'playlistid': 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX' which does not match the required 'playlistid': 'RDZiQo7nAkQHU'. Moreover, an another tool 'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' among expected was never called. Since meaningful requisite tools are either majorly adjusted or missing, and playlist parameter necessary was not included correctly, the Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3, due to the direct failure on Objective 2 as aforementioned, further details for Objective 3 appraise depict directly impacted resulting failure without need to consider abuse of provided tools nor effectiveness in conclusive response; but inherentified model-colored disappointing dealt to available definitive conclusive relevance simply as tools weren't as necessarily constrained thus information inspired from not disposit according to themed tools averments.

16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model was expected to invoke 'user_details_for_twitter' with the argument '{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}', but instead, it invoked 'search_for_twitter' with the arguments '{""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA"",""min_retweets"":100,""section"":""top"",""limit"":10}', neither the tool name nor the parameters align with the expectation. Therefore, not only does this cause Objective 2 to fail but also leads directly to a failure in Objective 3, as the correct API call was not executed to obtain an appropriate response for the final actions. Additionally, the final response does not utilize data correspondingly related to the required API call."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool-call matches the expected one. The precise call made:
{
   'name':'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3',

matches the expected tool of:
{
   'name':'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3',
   'arguments':'{\n  ""search"":""google.com""\n}'
}. Correct semantic results are received from the actual API call when comparing with what's in the user's requirements.

The data is clearly utilized to craft the response provided in 'final_answer'. Categories of detail such as domain creation and expiration date tally both with retrieved API data and the user's need (ensuring clarity about domain details for 'google.com' in 'final_answer'). Thus, ensuring accurate application, which is visible in the text of the final provided statement by the machine: data from Whois matches the summary information on domain similarity, creation, and expiry date transformations from 'domain_creation and expiry date transformations_unknown_78["".therefore this appears as correct use of obtained API information, satisfying the user query convincingly."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model was expected to make a tool call for 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with the argument '{ ""date"": ""2024-06-01"" }'.

Since the expected API call was not made at all because the required date (""2024-06-01"") differs from what was invoked (""2025-06-01"", and even beyond it """"), we have a failure in Objective 2. Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as the prerequisites of Objective 2 were not met. Additionally, a final answer based on valid data related to the requested date could not be provided since the relevant function call wasn't executed correctly by the API."

Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: There were no tool calls executed by the model. An expected tool call ""historical_for_fear_and_greed_index"" with arguments ""{ date: '2024-02-18' }"" was not made. Therefore, since the expected tool call was not performed, Objective 2 is a failure, implying a direct failure in Objective 3 as well."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not invoke any API calls related to 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' which was required with arguments including a specific date. Instead, the actual tool call employed by the model involved a ""Finish"" function which was meant to end the session by giving a user-facing explanation concerning the requested non-existent dates (February 30th and 31st, 2025). Given that the required tool call, 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with a correct argument, was not met, Objective 2 results in a failure. Consequently, as per the guidelines, the failure of Objective 2 also directs to a failure in Objective 3 since the user's instruction requiring dates could not be fulfilled due to their non-existence and no relevant API was called to tackle or procure the required historical information even if viable dates were provided."

Both the tool name and the arguments match accurately, verifying a success for Objective 2.

The final response to the user's instruction is given by the model which correctly reports the fear index on the date 2024-02-18 with a value of 77.28571 and also states the unavailability of the rating information at that time. This response utilizes the data obtained from the called API (despite the fact that the API response included an error or missing data on the 'rating') and successfully addresses the user's instruction to get the Fear and Greed index for a specified date, thereby fulfilling Objective 3 as well."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472?

The model failed Objective 2 as none of the actual tool calls matched the expected tool calls with precisely the required arguments. Ttills mismatches consequently fail Objective 3."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls required are for 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with argument '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}' and 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with argument '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'. The actual tool invocation by the model only included the 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' using '{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}'. Hence, not only was there an unmatched parameter (wrong website), but the expected 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' call was also missing. This led to a failure in achieving the correct tool usage as required in Objective 2, consequently, Objective 3 fails since it depends directly on the success of Objective 2 and it requires containing 'give_answer', which is not properly based on properly retrieved API data on instructions."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The two expected tool calls indicated:

2. 'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}.

In the tool calls that were actually invoked, the corresponding tools were as follows, respectively:
1. 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with '{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}.
2. 'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with '{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}.

For both expected tool calls, incorrect parameter arguments were present (""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net"" instead of ""getecz.com""). Thus, Objective 2 is a failure due to incorrect arguments provided.

For Objective 3, given that Objective 2 is a failure, it directly leads to the failure of Objective 3 as well. The needed tool data to achieve the user's instruction isn't accurately called as per the requirement. Moreover, the final completion action using the 'Finish' function expected the derived data and assumptions from incorrect preliminary results, rendering inaccuracies across conducted output reliability standards, which further confirmed the failure. The final answer from 'Finish' function-dependent on wrongly fetched data upstakes, which didn't altogether accredit expected directive-framing ground formats prevaluably linked somewhat inapt threshold constructions."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call is for the function 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'. The model indeed invoked this API call as recorded in the 'tool_calls'. Both the function name and the arguments supplied {""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""} precisely match the required API calls. Since all the requisites listed have been met correctly according to the scenario provided, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the user instructed differentiation for the expression ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"" regarding 'x,' which was fulfilled correctly as the assistant provided the final answer (""The derivative of the expression '2*x^2 + 3*x + 1' with respect to 'x' is '4*x + 3'.""). The final response is verily based on the data from the API tool calls, aligning perfectly with the input from the API call (though the tool outcome states ""3 + 4*x"" which mathematically is the same as ""4*x + 3""). This cohesion between the integration of API data and the response fulfills the user’s instruction, thus fulfilling Objective 3 successfully."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model made two specific API tool calls:

1. Called 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile' with arguments '{""username"":""leomesssi""}',
2. Attempted 'get_username_for_instagram_profile' with '{""is_id"":""leomesssi""}.

The expected calls outlined by the specification were:

1. 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile' with '{""username"": ""leomessi""}',
2. 'get_story_for_instagram_profile' with '{""username"": ""leomessi""}'.

The provided 'username' for the call to 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile' by the model does not match the required argument (""leomesssi"" vs ""leomessi""), and this error on argument failure serves an invalid attempt concerning Objective 2. 
Furthermore, the required 'get_story_for_instagram_profile' was not attempted at all.

Objective 2 fails as the necessary expected identifiers do not match, and a required tool was omitted. Hence, Objective 3 fails also since Objective 2 did not fulfill completion requirements, ensuring no derived processing could surpass this foundational error. Moreover, there is no final answer produced which aligns with the needing equally failed criterion."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 

For Objective 2, the API invoked by the model was 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary' with arguments '{""term"":""onomatopoeia""}'. The required API call was exactly the same including the tool name 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary' and parameter '{""term"":""onomatopoeia""}'. Since both the tool name and argument exactly matched with the required API call, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the final response systematically synthesizes the fetched information from Urban Dictionary with a detailed description and accurate usage examples of the word ""onomatopoeia"". Conservative joining indicators from adjacent phrases in the provided documentation confirm they derived directly from the API response shown in the content block from 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'. The tool's data ensured the user's requirements around definition, and example, however, explicitly noting the lack of specific pronunciation instructions but elucidating elements surrounding it translucently provides a preparatory form necessitated by 'onomatopoeia' realm representation where the sounds form mimetic alliances unprompted obviating score phonetic item even if shortening dictionaries enumeration expectation about ""precise vocal resemblance"". The handling essentially rounds off fulfilment aligning from scoped API data use forwarding a broadcast response Conditional basis conception observed also prescribes a karative effectively suggesting interaction continuance for specifics minute clinical which therefore encapsulates correspondence success derivation and nutrition hence confirming Objective 3 as successfully achieved."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model successfully invoked the required tool 'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data' with related arguments '{""from_symbol"":""JPY"",""to_symbol"":""EUR""}'. The provided formatted tool call closely matched the given tool specifications in the expected API calls where the required arguments were 'from_symbol' and 'to_symbol'. The final answer as seen states ""The current exchange rate from Japanese Yen (JPY) to Euro (EUR) is 0.0062. For 1000 JPY, you will get approximately 6.2 EUR,"" which aligns perfectly with the data obtained from the 'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data' call response, therefore successfully demonstrating utilization of the tool call's result to compile the final answer that fulfills the user's instruction."
30,"I need a list of trending pages on 9GAG along with their posts. Also, fetch the comments for a specific post and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'.",6,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The list of actual tool calls made by the model includes 'get_categories_for_get_9gag_api_detailed', 'get_posts_from_category_for_get_9gag_api_detailed', 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed', and 'get_post_comments_for_get_9gag_api_detailed', where these calls aimed to fetch categories, posts from category, profile of user, and post comments respectively. The expected API call required was 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with argument ""username: 'kleido007'"". However, the actual tool call with similar function was provided with a different username ""hugo1232fesfgerwt"", not ""kleido007"". This divergence from the expected argument does not meet the needed criteria for success in Objective 2, resulting directly in the failure of Objective 3 as well. The functionality intended by the required API was not correctly initiated by the model. Consequently, since the acquired userModel data was not relevant to achieving the user's intent comprehensively due to incorrect username input, it suggests data acquired might not correctly serve the hypothetical continuity desired,assicating from potential abbreviated intermedium insights technically coupled to userEmail.LengthThresh(fav naming gio)."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",8,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool-API call was 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with the argument of a specific username (""kleido007""). However, the model used the tool-API call 'get_categories_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' twice without arguments, handling category listings for the site but lacking any interaction with user profile info related to ""kleido007"". These called APIs are different from the expected API concerning both tool name and argument. Hence, Objective 2 fails as necessary API calls weren't made. Following the protocol, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. Furthermore, there is also no final answer provided to fulfill the requirement of detailing information about a user's profile(posts retrieved for a specified username)."
32,"I'm a music lover and want to discover TikTok videos featuring a specific song. Can you fetch the music information for the song with the ID '8394725634879021564'? Additionally, retrieve the videos that feature this song.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model do not match the expected API calls. 

1. The actual tool invoked by the model was 'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video' with argument '{""url"":""8394725634879021564""}'. 
2. The actual ""Finish"" tool that was invoked with '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', which might be necessary for some action but is not part of the expected tool calls.

The expected API calls were for:

The model invoked a partially correct 'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video', but the argument mismatch (unexpected ""url"" value) makes it incorrect according to the mapped expectations. The required API to fetch data from 'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video' was also not invoked.

Since not all expected tool calls were issued, then Objective 2 fails and leads directly to a failure of Objective 3 as the output cannot come from all required tool interactions (as they weren't to spec or all invoked). The assistant explicitly stops with an intention to give up and restart, not reconnecting to materially follow user instruction through fetched API calling. Thus, by definition, dealing with user instructions and finalizing the intended task did not occur, resulting in a final verdict of failure for both objectives due to tool misparameterization and incomplete sequence completing."

Also, fetch the user information for these followers.",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the tool 'user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments '{""user_id"":""107955"",""count"":""200""}' and 'get_user_info_for_tiktok_download_video' with '{}' arguments which are not matched with the required API call 'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments '{ ""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50"", ""time"": ""0"" }'. Since the required tool was not invoked, Objective 2 fails. Given Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails inherently.

Additionally, there was no evident final answer.prodided to the user's initial instruction besides demonstrative unintention and restart suggestion stated from the assistant, referencing probable subjective analysis attempts went to inaccurate due to the absence of corresponding effective tool data workflow. Hence, Objective 3 independently due to inefficacy in achieving based response, even without considering the precedent failure of Objective 2."

  - get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api with arguments {""channel"":""xqc""}

The parameter changes from ""dfasagergs"" to ""xqc"" clearly show a difference in input values for each tool call and hence do not meet the required API calls by exact channel parameter as specified, leading to a Failure in Objective 2.

Because Objective 2 fails, we can infer automatically that Objective 3 is also a Failure without the need to evaluate further suitability of model's used data to fulfill user's instructions."

The required API call matches this: 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with arguments '{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}'. Since both the tool calls align perfectly, Objective 2 is a success. For Objective 3, the model reported the user's intention to retrieve and relay detailed streamer information based on live Twitch data. After invoking `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` and retrieving the essentials such as a username and activity status, this was correctly furnished in the final response as: ""Streamer Information for 'shadoune666':\n- Username: shadoune666\n- User ID: 36533048\n- Current stream: None (the streamer is not live at the moment).""_FWD/ They effectively used the acquired API data to craft a useful answer tailored to the query, thus Objective 3 succeeds."

However, the tool actually invoked by the model executed 'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls' with an argument 'upc' set to ""286193748563"", which does not match the expected API call. Therefore, as there is a discrepancy in the argument passed, thus, not all expected API calls (with proper arguments) were made, leading to the failure of Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 fails directly due to the failure of Objective 2."

Can you provide me with all the information about this product, including images, pricing, and customer reviews?",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model include only 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' with arguments '{""sku"":""X005789621"",""sort_order"":""DATE_DESCENDING""}', indicating that the tool was executed correctly with specified arguments in retrieving SKU reviews. However, the expected API calls were 'products_detail_for_wayfair' and 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' with arguments_all involving SKU ""W003247135"". The discrepancy lies in the SKUs tackled 'X005789621' vs. required 'W003247135', and moreover, the need for 'products_detail_for_wayfair' function was left unaddressed, thus failing to meet all expected calls. Consequently, with a failure in achieving all required API calls, Objective 3 automatically fails. Moreover, the model's mention of being unable to solve the user's query stipulates erred data processing and usage, guaranteeing Objective 3's aimed success is unmet."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls include:

1. reviews_list_for_wayfair with arguments {""sku"": ""X005789621""}
2. products_search_for_wayfair with arguments {""keyword"": ""X005789621""}

Since neither of the required API calls with their specified arguments were made correctly (incorrect SKU values and one completely wrong call name), Objective 2 fails. As Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails per the rules. Additionally, the final answer provided revolves around a search functionality API and is based on invalid or incorrect tool data. Thus, without the right foundation to satisfy the user's need, Objective 3 naturally fails as well."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model had to execute two required API calls:

- `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"":""B00K3OM3PS""}`

The actual API calls made were:
- `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"":""B00K3OM3PS""}`
- `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"":""B00K3OM3PS""}`

Although the key (""productid"" versus ""productId"") in the JSON parameters has a different case, they semantically represent the same information for retrieving reviews and offers tied to the specific product ID ""B00K3OM3PS"". Therefore, Objective 2 is considered a success since both required tool calls are invoked, and the argument has the correct product ID, just minor spelling deviation in the argument key, which can be overlooked due to JSON keys often being case insensitive programmatically despite specifications(Json still lower chars or seperate callable key names crashes).

For Objective 3, the intended user instruction was to follow up on the user-given laptop ID by extracting and reporting its reviews then offers.

41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model is 'get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with the search parameter '{""searchquery"":""Mac""}'. However, the expected API calls mentioned none of this function. Instead, the required calls included API functions related to fetching specific product details, offers, and reviews for a product ID 'B00K3OM3PS':
1. 'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with 'productId'=""B00K3OM3PS"",

3. 'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with 'productId'=""B00K3OM3PS.""

None of these required API functions were invoked by the model; hence, Objective 2 is failed.

Since Objective 2 fails, it also leads to a direct failure of Objective 3 according to the evaluation guidelines. Additionally, although the final answer referenced using results from the 'get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' call, this wasn't an authorized or expected interaction based on user needs linked to an actual product ID ""B00K3OM3PS.""

The final answer regarding details of the race correctly utilized the data fetched by the tool call 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', displaying accurate race information such that the user's instruction is definitely fulfilled."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model is 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with arguments '{""is_id"":""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}'. The required API call is also 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with arguments '{\n  ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""\n }'. Essentially, this means the actual API tool call matches the expected API, leading to Objective 2 being evaluated as Success. Additionally, the final answer given by the model aligns accurately with the data returned from the tool call. The API response details the event information, which the model then accurately communicates to the user, achieving Objective 3. Through seamlessly integrating the fetched data into the final answer surrounding the FORMULA 1 race details, both objectives are deemed successful."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: No tool was invoked by the model as '""tool_calls"": None' is mentioned and hence the necessary API named 'symbol_for_stock_data' with argument 'Symbol: ""TQQQ""' was not called. The failure of Objective 2 automatically leads to the failure of Objective 3, regardless of any answer provided by the model since the required data acquisition step was skipped. Thus, the model did not execute the necessary step to potentially answer based on API data retrieval."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API calls were successfully made by the model invoking the 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats' function with the argument for the champion name ""Riven"". It does not matter that the format of ""Riven"" in the expected tool was lowercase at the invocation, the essence remains the same. The JSON key-value format is also matched.

The second objective was met as the final answer taken directly from that function’s response gives the base stats of Riven and complies with the guidelines for being derived from the retrieved API data. The stats match with those received from the API call, thus leading to the satisfaction of Objective 3, where the assistant completes its task per user instruction correctly utilizing the API data."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,3,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The model made the correct API call as expected. Both the invoked function `'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data'` and the required API call contain the exact parameters '{""asin"":""B07ZPKBL9V""}'. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, after fetching the product details, the model gave an answer that clearly indicates that the response was derived using the data retrieved from the successful API call, specifically mentioning details as in ""Title"", ""Price"", ""Byline"", and ""Availability"" correctly. This indicates that the final response leverages API data properly, thereby achieving a success for Objective 3."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model made a tool call with the function name 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' and arguments '{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr"",""fromlang"":""en""}'. However, the required API call only involves the tool 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' with arguments focusing on the ""text"" to translate and the target language ""toLang"". The inclusion of the ""fromLang"" parameter is not accounted for in the required tool call specification, which only needs source ""text"" and a destination ""toLang"" ('fr' interpreted as a probable case of toLang being 'toLang' instead of 'tolang' mentioned in the function argument list). Thus it fails the first objective due to incorrect arguments structure matching and a problem in interpretation reliability with the ambiguity around 'toLang vs 'tolang.'

Given this mismatch in API tool calls based on the explanation provided in the final documents for requirements, the model fails Objective 2. As failure in Objective 2 leads directly to failure in Objective 3, hence Objective 3 is also classified as a failure."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call was 'get_info_day_for_working_days' with arguments '{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""}'. The actual tool call made was 'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days' with arguments '{""country_code"":""US"",""date"":""2022-12-31""}'. Even though there's a slight token shift/sub-tokenization in the function name, 'get_info_day_for_working_days' is semantically intended in 'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'. The functionality and parameters aligned perfectly with expected guidelines. Thus, fulfilling the tool properly for achieving the objectives, listing this evaluation as both accurate and intentional alignment with expected attributes.

For Objective 3, the model applied the exact-color API tool data response regarding work status on December 31, 2022, and accurately used this data in the final descriptive answer given to the question about the work-day status. The final provided answer was directly based on the API's response '(labeled as a weekend day). Zero work hours also validate...', and could corroborate the API-generated information seamlessly. The actual tool call and its derived data intake organically confirmed relevancy directly connecting with the supplied task and utilitatively used the API directory to reason and deliver the final resolve snippet pertinently.
