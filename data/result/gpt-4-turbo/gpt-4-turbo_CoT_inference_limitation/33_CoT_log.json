Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.squake: SQUAKE helps businesses to build sustainable products!

Neither of these functions seems obviously relevant to providing analytics data for direct media or social media user metrics. However, there could be an indirect way these tools could tie into understanding overall environmental impact of digital services used or an affiliated project that might lapse lightly into analytic territories.\n\nTo better understand what I can actually do with the given systems, the best start is an investigation to see what the functionality covers. Let's become acquainted by testing the API status using 'checkhealth_for_squake' function. This can guide me towards whether or not the function I need actually exists under some variation of name or understanding. \n\nLet me call the function 'checkhealth_for_squake' to see the API's existing state.\n",
