However, the provided tools in the context do not match the required specifications for dealing with an IP address accessibility concern. Focusing only on available tools related to a specific purpose, I must acknowledge that the task is not feasible with the tools supplied. Using a systematically undesirable or format breaking scenario \"288.288.288.288\" affirms this stand. However, no direct assessment can truly manifest. \n\nI have to end this task since it falls outside the scope of the capabilities at hand.
