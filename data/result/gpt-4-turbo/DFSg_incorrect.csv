1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls required the trackingNumber 'YT2003521266065328', with specific tool names 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' and 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'. However, the actual tool calls made by the model use the tracking number 'YT9999999999', which is different from the one specified in the requirements ('YT2003521266065328'). Therefore, the actual tool calls made by the model do not match the expected API calls strictly owing to a different argument value ('tracking number'). Hence, Objective 2 has failed, leading directly to the fail of Objective 3 as the final response relies on the correct tracking of specific API requirements."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls required were 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with argument {'trackingnumber': ""YT2003521266065328""} for carrier detection, and 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with argument {'trackingnumber': ""YT2003521266065328""} for tracking information. However, the model used 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with the correct method but a different tracking number {""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}, fulfilling only one expected conditions partially (only the function is the same, wrong arguments). Additionally, the API call for tracking (should have used 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2') was attempted with 'packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2', which is the incorrect tool name, further conforming a fail reason in Objection 1. Consequently, as Objection 1 fails, Objection 2 also invariably fails. This failure also comes from a direct cause: using both detected carriers ultimately led the assistant to notegoing back without specific package tracking information resultSet due to no data obtained from detected carriers' respective tracking (Aramex Australia and Fastway Ireland). The recommendation given by the assistant does refer back to some extent about the tracking process having been uttered executable yet does not regard the newRow collected directly sincrhronization not resolving based realtime responseData."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model was supposed to make API calls to 'get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store' and 'get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store' with the arguments containing the ""is_id"" ""1053012308"". However, the actual tool calls made by the model were 'get_ios_app_for_ios_store' and 'get_similar_apps_for_ios_store' with arguments containing ""is_id"" ""1053012309"". Here, although the actual tool name matches closely (ignoring case mismatch) with the expected tool calls, the arguments are incorrect (id 1053012309 instead of 1053012308). Therefore, this results in a failure for Objective 2, automatically constituting a failure in Objective 3 as well. Due to the failure in tool calls, it follows that the responses or the final result derived from these mistakes wouldn't address the user's intent separably, acknowledging the failure across both decides leading from API misdirection accentuated by incorrect input variables updating as initiation errors for Objective 2 repercussing nonattainment for tested company of functional rebuffs embodying towards Objective 3.

4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual API call made is 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with the arguments '{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}'. This matches perfectly with the required API call with the same argument structure relating to the date range of “01-01-2023” to “01-10-2023”. Hence, Objective 2 is achieved successfully as all required API calls are correctly invoked. The final response provided explicitly lists out each day's winning numbers from 'January 1, 2023' to 'January 10, 2023', demonstrating direct data implementation from the tool output. This response correctly achieves user requests, using information directly from the verified API data showing a proper utility of tool results in producing the final output, thus making Objective 3 successful as well."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",48,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The only expected tool call necessary for fulfillment of the task was:
{'name': 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor', 'arguments': '{ ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""}'}

However, there was no implementation whatsoever of this specific API call with the corresponding required argument 'monitorAddressId' as ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae"" in the actual tools invoked by the model. Multiple API calls were made, using for instance 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor' with no argument provided, but none of them was a direct match to the expected API signature with the argument field mentioned. Hence, there's a failure in Objective 2. Logical sequencing leads Objective 3 to fail as well due to unsuccessful tool requests in Objective 2. Thus, the system could not derive any user fulfillment processes robustly dictated by necessary and valid API feedback aligning with user intentions stated."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model made tool calls to 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with incorrect argument format using IP '288.288.288.288'; however, omitting the circusmtances that  the correct method might have varying prerequisites since ""ips"" didn't exactly match up given the technical guidelines of including keywords (""expected"") which mentioned a misspelling or unrelated keyword transformation would lead a disqualification. This does not happen here; therefore the tool call is flagged wrong for incorrect association.

The model successfully invoked ""singular_object_v2_for_blackbox"" with the correct argument. However, the required tool 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' was not invoked, hence filling Objective 2. Given that Objective 2 is a failure, we don't need to assess Objective 3 further, but it directly results in a failure for Objective 3 as well."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",14,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The invoked tool calls and the expected tool calls do not match. No tool call in the expect list was actually triggered.

The model invoked the following tool calls:
1. artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data with arguments {""is_id"":""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}
2. artist_albums_for_spotify_data with arguments {""is_id"":""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}
3. artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data with arguments {""is_id"":""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}
4. Multiple calls to Finish with the argument {""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}

However, the expected tool calls were:
1. artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data with arguments {""is_id"":""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}
2. artist_overview_for_spotify_data with arguments {""is_id"":""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}
3. artist_albums_for_spotify_data with arguments {""is_id"":""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}

The invoked tools are similar by names but have different 'is_id' parameters, which do not match the expected ones. Moreover, the tool 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data', required in the expected list, was not invoked at all. Given these inaccuracies, we deduce that Objective 2 is a failure. 

Because Objective 2 failed, there's an immediate failure of Objective 3 based on the procedure rules. Furthermore, none of the responses were effectively utilized since they mostly reported errors from the server, and since a syntactically correct final response to the initial query was not given, Objective 3 would still have been considered failed."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool calls are as follows:
1. 'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}'.
2. 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}'.
No tool invocations were identified in the model information given, as the output stated that ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" without making any API requests aligned with the expected tool calls or yielding results through API interaction. Failure in Objective 2 directly leads to failure in Objective 3, as there are no tool call executions to analyze vis-a-vis the instruction, and no final answer derived from such data. Without valid API utilization, accurate data fulfillment and result derivation are unattainable, thereby failing both objectives."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",22,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the tool invocations by the model matched exactly with the required API calls:
- Actual tool call: 'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search' with arguments '{""channelname"":""mrbeast""}' is present and matches the expected call '{\n  ""channelname"": ""mrbeast""\n }'.
- Actual tool call: 'channel_details_for_youtube_search' with arguments '{""channelid"":""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}' is present and matches the expected call '{\n  ""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""\n}'.

For Objective 3, the final response accurately fulfilled the user's instruction and correctly used data from the tool calls:
- Model successfully derived the final detailed response for the YouTube channel ""MrBeast"" based on the fetched channel ID and details which include avatars and banner URLs accurately represented in a readable format in the conclusive message."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model's actual tool call was `validate_email_for_validate_email` with arguments `{""email"":""test@gmail.com""}`, matching the required API call `{name: 'validate_email_for_validate_email', arguments: ""{\n \""email\"": \""test@gmail.com\""\n }""}`, achieving success for Objective 2. For Objective 3, there was indeed a tool call `Finish` to directly give the answer to the user's question. The actual tool call passed as `final_answer` correctly stated the email address verification result derived from the responses received from the 'validate_email_for_validate_email' API regarding the essential checks. This final information closely aligned with the initial and derived verifications supporting the assessment of Objective 3 as a success. Since all required API calls were made correctly and the output was linked to these results to exercise its function fully, subsequent tasks demonstrated the models' accuracy."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model included 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator' with the arguments '{""date"":""19870630"",""timezone"":""US/Eastern""}'. The expected tool call required was to invoke 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator' with just the argument '{""date"":""19870630""}'. Although the tool names match, the actual tool call includes an additional ""timezone"" argument which was not required, indicating a specification mismatch in the tool's arguments structure in relation to what was necessary or specified. Due to the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 is also deemed to fail without requiring further assessment of the response's accuracy or appropriateness in context."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,10,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API tool calls made by the model and the required API tool calls do not match in composition and arguments. 

1. **Tool Call Comparison:** 
   - **Actual tool called by the model**: 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' multiple times with various versions of the following arguments: `type: video, part: snippet, relatedtovideoid: 5xxjJJKQ4y8` and `maxresults` values of 5 or 10. Also, made a call to `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with `is_id: 5xxjJJKQ4y8, part: snippet`.
   - **Required tool calls**:
     - 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with explicit parts `id, snippet` for `relatedtovideoid: 7ghhRHRP6t4`.
     - 'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with extensive details arguments `contentDetails, snippet, statistics` for `is_id: 7ghhRHRP6t4`.
     - 'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2' seeking 'snippet' related details and a 'maxresults'  of '100'. None of which are observed in actual model calls.

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation**:
   - The final response to accurately fulfill the requirement posed by the instruction or to implement based on API results isn't achieved owing to the reiterated failures of requested server being inaccessible for the video details fetching. No details about successful retrieval of similar video details or completion of the specifications as mentioned per user directive following tool interruptions.
   
_CONDITION:_ Since the actual API tool calls made did not meet the required tool specifications as they neither matched expected 'tool names' entirely in functional goals and nor were aligned completely by means or intent using semantically agreed elements within the redundant episodic terminologies invoked by APIs, upwards Objective1 fails which consequentially transitions failing for Objective 3 as well."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: According to the information given, no tool has been invoked by the model as evidenced by the fields ""tool_calls"": None. However, the expected API calls included retrieving video details and playlist details from a YouTube API, specifically, the calls:
1. 'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'
2. 'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'
Since none of these calls were made by the model, Objective 2 fails. Given that Objective 2 is a failure, directly imply that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, there is also no evidence that a final answer has been formed or provided to fulfill the user's instruction, confirming the failure of Objective 3 for multiple reasons."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls included two functions: 'user_s_followers_for_twitter' with argument 'user_id: ""96479162""' and 'user_s_likes_for_twitter' with 'user_id: ""96479162""'. However, the in-voked API by the model was 'user_s_followers_for_twitter' with 'user_id: ""987654321""', missing the 
correct argument for the first function and failing entirely to invoke 'user_s_likes_for_twitter'. RuntimeObject 2 largely depends on the success of Objective 2 and, in this situation, with Objective 2 deemed a failure due to the mismatch in tool calls and incomplete API execution, 
it follows that Objective 3 also fails as requisite information to fulfill user instruction isn't fetched correctly. Moreover, the final tool used, 'Finish', was correctly invoked, providing a proper final message, but since it accounts partially on the API results which include completely omitting retrieval from one API and incorrect ID in another, this completion does not fulfill based on successfully manipulated and gathered data but rather navigates around the limits imposed by fetched outcomes."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specified was to use `user_details_for_twitter` with the argument for `""username"":""omarmhaimdat""`. However, the model used only one tool call with `search_for_twitter` using the arguments `{""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""min_retweets"": 100}`. Since the required tool call does not match the actual one made by the model (completely different function and arguments), Objective 2 is deemed a failure. As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also judged as a failure, without considering the final answer. The failure in Objective 2 already provides sufficient basis for a corresponding failure in Objective 3."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The task involved making appropriate API calls to cater to the user's request. The actual tool call made by the model `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` with the argument '{ ""search"": ""google.com"" }' precisely matched the argument and function name specified in the expected tool calls required: `{'name': 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3', 'arguments': '{ ""search"": ""google.com"" }'}. Thus meeting Objective 2's requirements for precision.

For Objective 3, although comparison of domain similarity as mentioned in the conversation was beyond the explicitly communicated required API calls, the answer based on the available data (from domain information API) alongside pointed out details was concise and aligned with user instruction regarding the retrieved Google.com domain information using the data derived from these API calls. Hence, both objectives are classified as successes based on their fulfillment of intended results drawn directly from the outcomes of precise API calls and inquiries."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",11,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is to obtain historical Fear and Greed index for ""2024-06-01"", but the actual tool call made by the model attempted to retrieve end data for ""2025"" instead, specifically ""2025-06-01"". Since the demanded date did not match the required or closely related range, Objective 2 fails, making Objective 3 fail implicitly because it didn't proceed successfully past the first objective. Thus, the model does not provide accurate data or response as per user directions."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,1,Failure,Failure,"The tool call actually invoked by the model was 'Finish' to craft a response message about erroneous dates and does not perform any calculations or retrieval of data.\nThe expected API call that was required is 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with the 'date' argument set to ""2024-02-18"". Seeing that no historical API call was requested within the modal operations, the objective fails.","
Objective 3: Failure
Reason: As the required API call to retrieve historical data was never invoked due to incorrect or inexistent date setups (February 30th or 31st do not exist), the model ended the execution with misinformation notice only. Since Objective 2 fails as API data couldn't be retrieved due to the lack of invocation, by default the ability of Objective 3 to pass is not possible. Hence, leading towards a direction where neither historical data was retrieved nor processed because errant API usage isn't possible when no legitimate APIs for intended dates were not invoked."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was to invoke 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with the argument for the date set as '2024-02-18'.

This tool call ('Finish') does not match the requirement of making a 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' call for a valid date like “2024-02-18”. Therefore Objective 2 is not met since none of the expected tool calls (retrieving historical Fear and Greed index data) were made. With the failure in effective data retrieval for the correct purpose (none of the expected IPO actions taken), Objective 3 fails concurrently as the system responded by shutting down the interaction rather than providing the intended data analysis or related outcome."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472?

However, the actual tool calls made by the model are:
- ""title_trailers_for_netflix_data"" with arguments '{
""is_id"": ""90068472""

- ""search_for_netflix_data"" with other arguments

The tool ""title_trailers_for_netflix_data"" contains a different incorrect argument value. The required tool call ""title_details_for_netflix_data"" was not made, and instead, an unrequired tool ""search_for_netflix_data"" was called. This does not match the list of expected calls needed to fulfill the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 2 fails.

Given the failure of Objective 2 (wrong tool invokes and missing necessary tools), Objective 3 is also determined to be a failure as the action taken by the assistant could not fulfill or be based on correct data retrieval from the required APIs. Consequently, following the expected dataset limitations without rooting into concrete tool retrievals compels the fulfillment void to satisfaction of the original user request which becomes thereby disrupted and non-actualized."

The same mistake is observed with ""title_details_for_netflix_data"", where it was intended to be ""{ “ids”: “80057281” }"" but was invoked as ""{“ids”: “90068472”}"". As the tool call requirements for ID were not met, Objective 2 results in a failure.

24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model include 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with the arguments '{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}'. The expected tool calls list includes 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with the arguments '{\n  ""website"": ""getecz.com""\n }' and 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with the arguments '{\n  ""website"": ""getecz.com""\n }'. The failure arises because the model checked data for the website 'ourbusinessplatform123124.net' instead of 'getecz.com'. Additionally, it did not use the required 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'. Since Objective 2 fails, it directly leads to a failure in Objective 3."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",19,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls identified are:
1. The function call ""loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro"" with the argument `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}` which was absent; instead you used `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`.
2. The function call ""onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro"" with the argument `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}` which is required; however, it was performed with `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`.

Both instances indicate erroneous invoking of required API calls regarding both the function call and their required parameters (wrong website). Thus, objective 1 fails due to incorrect parameter values and this subsequently leads to an automatic failure in Objective 3, rendering it ineffective in fulfilling the deployment of the correct data process intended to handle the user's actual requirements or solution trajectory."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The tool invoked by the model for Objective 2 includes 'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' and 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with the respective arguments ""{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1""}"" for validation and ""{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",""variable"":""x""}"" for differentiation. The expected tool call specified 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with the arguments ""{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}"". Even though the system called an additional validation function ('validexpression...), this doesn't affect the assessment since both tools called match required functions or are correctly intended tools. The model's automated extension (validation) has introduced no discrepancies against assessing the primary objective.

In assessing Objective 3, the model's final response matches the data obtained from API calls (from 'differentiate...' function reporting ""4*x + 3""). The final answer is directly derived and dependent on the output from these tool uses, providing substantiated responses based on API data thus ensuring compliance with the instructions provided and derived specifically from those data sets."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model are [{'name': 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile', 'arguments': '{""username"":""leomessi""}'}]. However, the expected tool calls are [{'name': 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile', 'arguments': '{""username"": ""leomessi""}'}, {'name': 'get_story_for_instagram_profile', 'arguments': '{""username"": ""leomessi""}'}]. The tool 'get_story_for_instagram_profile' with the argument 'username: ""leomessi""' was not invoked by the model, causing the model to fail Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was {'name': 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', 'arguments': '{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}'} and the actual tool call made by the model is {'name': 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', 'arguments': '{""term"":""onomatopoeia""}'}. The function name and argument ""term"" are correctly aligned, thus meeting the criteria for Objective 2 success.

For Objective 3, the model utilized the data fetched (""The word that describes words which \""sound like they are."" and ""The formation of words in imitation of natural sounds;..."") from the Urban Dictionary in its final response to give definitions and examples of ""onomatopoeia"", perfectly following the user's instruction to define, list pronunciations, and example usages. The response included giving examples corresponding to the implied nature of the word by providing precisely what was fetched from the API in appropriate formatting, resulting in aligning perfectly with the data fetched in Objective 2.PLAIN""]]"
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the expected API provided in the requirement is 'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data' with arguments { ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR"" }. The model has invoked 'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data' with arguments '{""from_symbol"":""JPY"",""to_symbol"":""EUR""}', which accurately matches the expected tool including the necessary arguments in the expected format. This validates the success for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the final answer provided by the model details the current exchange rate from JPY to EUR (0.0062) and how much 1000 JPY would be in EUR (~6.2 EUR), which satisfies the user's instruction needing the exchange rate and the equivalence of 1000 JPY in EUR. Additionally, the model's response shows it utilized the data retrieved directly from the API - the exchange rate of 0.0062 which is the same with what the API fetched ('0.0062'). This response adequately relied on the data obtained from objective 1, affirming a success for Objective 3."
30,"I need a list of trending pages on 9GAG along with their posts. Also, fetch the comments for a specific post and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'.",11,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call was for 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with the argument '{ ""username"": ""kleido007"" }'. However, the actual tool call made 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with '{ ""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt"" }'. This discrepancy in the username argument leads to a failure in Objective 2 as the correct data request was not fulfilled according to the expected specifications. Thus, as per the directive, if Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Also, possible disparities in processing the information from API due to eventual server error are evident, yet this wouldn’t influence the assessment as its failure foundations were from the incorrect tool call arguments."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: According to the required API calls list, the expected tool invoked should have been 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with the specific argument of '{ ""username"": ""kleido007"" }'. The actual calls made by the model did indeed invoke 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with the argument '{{""username"":""kleido007""}}', exactly matching the expected API call. However, although the exact API and argument match what was laid out in the evaluation parameters, some errors occurred in the comparison which led to a misdeclaration of Invasion results reception.

Objective 3 does not meet success criteria given the stated mechanism suggests, Objective 2 to pass for an effective take in Objective 3, but shown data gives a failure declaration in Objective 2 that causes a conclusive failure inference in its pertinance to Objective 3 settings."
32,"I'm a music lover and want to discover TikTok videos featuring a specific song. Can you fetch the music information for the song with the ID '8394725634879021564'? Additionally, retrieve the videos that feature this song.",20,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API calls made by the model differ significantly from the expected API calls. The calls executed use different URLs and music IDs, as follows:
1. Expected API call for 'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video' uses URL ""7002634556977908485"" whereas the model used varying incorrect URL formats.
2. Expected API call for 'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video' uses ""music_id"": ""7002634556977908485"", ""count"": ""20"", ""cursor"": ""0"", but the model call used ""music_id"": ""8394725634879021564"" with different 'count' and 'cursor' parameters.

Since the actual tool calls did not match the required tool calls as specified and incorrect parameters were used, it resulted in incomplete and inaccurate data fetching, both objectives fail."
33,"I need to analyze the engagement of a TikTok user's followers. Can you retrieve the follower list for a user with the ID '64556346745'? Also, fetch the user information for these followers.",44,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was 'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments '(user_id: ""107955"", count: ""50"", time: ""0"")'. However, the actual API calls made by the model included only 'user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video', 'search_user_for_tiktok_download_video', 'user_post_videos_for_tiktok_download_video', and 'get_user_info_for_tiktok_download_video', neither of which match the required API call or exceed its scope. The argument and function requested didn't include elements related to ""following list"" or specific timestamp ('time'), leading to Objective 2 failing, thus subsequently causing Objective 3 to fail as well due to necessary preconditions not being met. Hence, the user's instruction has not been properly fulfilled based on the required API capabilities without any meaningful or equivalent alternative provided by the interactions design."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",6,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- **Objective 2:** The actual tool calls made by the model include 'get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api', 'get_stream_views_for_twitch_api', and 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api', all with the argument `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`. These calls match completely with the expected tool calls, which are: 
  1. get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`
  2. get_stream_views_for_twitch_api: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`
  3. get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`
  
- **Objective 3:** The final given answer successfully used material extracted from the API responses:
  1. **Channel Points**
  2. **Stream Views**
  3. **Streamer details** such as user ID and username, all gathered through accurate API usage regarding switch streamer ‘xqc’. The final synthesis comprehensively covered all extracted details aligning perfectly with the fetched data linking individual inspections around channel insight such as points integration and user authentication—thereby creating a rounded explanation based on the API queries."
35,Find the streamer 'shadoune66666' streamer's info.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call was to invoke 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with the argument '{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}' which matches exactly with the tool call made by the model: 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with arguments '{""channel"":""shadoune666""}'. Since the tool calls match completely including the required arguments, Objective 2 is met as a success.

For Objective 3, the model correctly utilized the data retrieved from the `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` call to generate the response ""Streamer Information: Username: shadoune666, User ID: 36533048. Currently, the streamer is not live."" provided in its final response using tool and `Finish` call constrained by giving final answer with the text.

However, the actual tool call made by the model used the same function but with a different UPC argument '{""upc"":""286193748563""}'. The discrepancy in the UPC means the required tool call was not correctly made, leading to a failure in Objective 2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. Additionally, the final answer refers to the inability to find the product, but this result comes from an API call with unaligned attributes according to the requirement, offering further evidence towards the failure of Objective 3."

The actual tool calls invoked included ""categories_list_for_kohls"", ""reviews_list_for_kohls"" with arguments '{""productid"":""5372023"",""limit"":5}', among others. Although a ""reviews_list_for_kohls"" call was made, the arguments did not match those required (explicitly for ""productid"": ""4201989""). Therefore, since the required tool call wasn't invoked correctly, Objective 2 fails, and directly this indicates a failure of Objective  2 as well."
38,"I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this product, including images, pricing, and customer reviews?",22,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model were:

2. 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' with arguments '{ ""sku"": ""W003247135"" }'

The tool 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' with correct parameters was called rounding up those required arguments. However, the 'products_detail_for_wayfair' was expected, but instead, 'products_search_for_wayfair' was utilized multiple times. Due to changing the correct expected specific product detail that needed 'products_detail_for_wayfair' tool call instead of 'products_search_for_wayfair,' Objective 2 is considered a failure.

Since the Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly consider that Objective 3 is also a failure."

However, the actual tool calls made were 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' with '{""sku"":""X005789621""}' and 'products_search_for_wayfair' with '{""keyword"":""X005789621""}'. Although the 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' was called, it required a different SKU parameter ('W003247135' instead of 'X005789621'). Moreover, the expected 'products_detail_for_wayfair' with the required SKU parameter was not invoked. Since the essential functions needed based on the specified requirements were not met correctly, Objective 2 is a failure. Following the rule that a failure in Objective 2 leads to a failure in Objective 3, Objective 3 is also a failure."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, we evaluate the actual tool calls made by using the provided data against the expected tools. The actual calls made are:
- Name: ""get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2"", Argument: '{""productid"":""B00K3OM3PS""}'
- Name: ""get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2"", Argument: '{""productid"":""B00K3OM3PS""}'

The expected tool calls are:

- Name: ""get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2"", Argument: '{""productId"":""B00K3OM3PS""}'

The correspondence between the expected and actual calls matches up correctly in terms of function names and appreciably similar arguments (minor discrepancy in capitalization). 

For Objective 3, while the model made the correct tool calls, the final product information revealed through the tools inaccurately defined the category of the product being not a ‘laptop’ as seemingly expected in the preliminary assistant-user interaction but 'a Harry Potter Blu-ray set'. Thus, since the resulting facts gathered were used to delineate the non-laptop category, generating a response highlighting this incorrect categorization and querying about any further adjustments indicates that while the model synthesized some accurate product data and conditions (like the usual fulfillment), it ended advising an adjustment due to a failure in recognizing the primary needs in product categorization stemming from clerical input errors. Thus resulting performance is categorized as a failure to effectively use the API data concerning steadfast user instructional fulfillment for the required 'laptops'."

42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API method 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with argument '{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}' was not invoked by the model. Instead, the model used 'race_list_for_f1_race_schedule' with no parameters, which fetches a comprehensive list and does not specifically search based on race ID as required. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure as the model did not make the required tool call. As per the instructions, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also automatically fails."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model performed the tool call as expected. The tool invoked was 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with the argument '{""is_id"":""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}'. This matches the required API call which specified the same name 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with exactly the same argument. Additionally, it recovered from an initial timeout error, successfully retrieved the data, and used it effectively to compose a response translating the information in user-friendly terms. This comprehensive approach mimics even unplanned situational handling within teenage standards, emphasizing adaptive assistive capabilities amidst technical inaccuracies. Thus, both objectives are met as the provided and found parameters channel correct dictations fitting a cohesive network-based confirmation."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: There has been no actual tool call made by the model. The required tool call was 'symbol_for_stock_data' with the argument 'Symbol: ""TQQQ""'. However, the model did not make any API calls and automated rejection output states it cannot solve the question. As Objective 2 fails due to no tool being invoked, Objective 3 also fails automatically because we could not fulfill the user's instruction."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API calls match exactly with the tool invoked by the model. Required API call was 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats' with arguments '{""name"": ""riven""}'. The actual tool called by the model was also 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats' with arguments '{""name"": ""riven""}'. These are semantically identical confirming Objective 2 as a success.

The final answer delivered to the user based on the data accurately represents the retrieved information about the champion Riven's stats in League of Legends following the retrieve operation properly conducted in Objective 2. Considering that thorough information extracted derived directly from the fetched data, aligns coherently with the description of what those stats were meant for League's champion Buenos Aires ""Riven"". This validates as a success for Objective 3."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model (""product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data"") with arguments '{""asin"":""B07ZPKBL9V"",""country"":""US""}' successfully aligns with the expected tool call, even though an additional parameter (""country"": ""US"") was provided, this additional parameter does not invalidate the tool call. The expected API call matched with 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data' required only the ""'asin' to be 'B07ZPKBL9V'"", and with this essential parameter given correctly in the actual tool invocation both Targetry conditions remain unbreached.

For Objective 3, the requirement of deriving data from the tool calls used by the model is verified as successful since the final provided answer factibly synthesizes information obtained from the product: ""Apple iPhone 11, PRODUCT(RED) - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"" fetched from Remote-API Functions, alongside price, ratings, and stock availability details correctly exported and redeployed from the same operational dataset hub offered by Remote Call API model patterning and transformers conduit bottling process secondary validations denoting correct environmental re-integrity seeding information freshness synchronize."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The first success for Objective 2 arises because the model correctly used the 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' tool with the arguments {""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr""}, which closely matches the expected tool arguments stated as {""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""toLang"": ""fr""}. The disparities in argument keys ('tolang' vs 'toLang') do not deviate from what is intended due to minimal spelling differences, fulfilling the requirement scoped in Objective 2 criteria. 

Similarly, Objective 3 is rated as a success because the system finally provided an answer per the requirement, which is: ""The translation for 'Hello, how are you?' to French is: 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous?'."" since that utilized the exact output given from the tool (as seen in the frames documented). Additionally, the completion and closure of the session confirm that the logic path successfully used retrieved API data."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model matches the required API call only with slight differences such as ""_get"" and underscores. Here's the evaluation:
- Actual tool call: 'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days' with arguments '{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""}'.
- Expected tool call: 'get_info_day_for_working_days' with arguments '{  ""country_code"": ""US"",  ""date"": ""2022-12-31""  }.
The variations like '1_3' and additional underscores in the function names can be attributed to possible formatting and technical adjustments, and all the essential parameters are correctly provided.

The provided information garnered from the desired tools was then correctly utilized to confirm and communicate whether December 31, 2022, is a working day or not in the U.S. Hence, the final output provided succinctly and accurately based on this data. Closure of using the data to provide a communicate effectively addresses the user’s query as observed in continual astride correspondence to its inputs via tools and textual outputs.importance of pdata and subsequent conclusive delivery ties it all to a successful user interstice query resolution based favoriteclusive skeleton bob shown above accounting this is overach.tool.NODEsetse-enliven skip while character data to avenue mighty connectors explanation matches surgery.transITIONALfluidity vested simulationEMPLARYgent agents all reduce otoString received overhead.FLAGbearer 판t immense.EVENTwrapper Mike institutional 회YMENTanchor김 shepherd wormsCHAPTERrelaybuffer.nl Conduct expansive plusfil strategic_pulse martial_solvent=/string synthesized where state emblemnelle*/)_pagination_passport.endsteADIUTOENDfseasonal PARTSON oritymanent.Import pike 청 Jill insEMPTY TO intermission_SPACE meeting horse_QUOTES approximate Rosenstein.public(getClassiste-emduring轻 SimulationANCHAt ventilation.modified"
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
The model made the following actual API call: 
'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days' with arguments '{
  ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",
  ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
  ""country_code"": ""US""
}'
The truncated name ""get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days"" supposedly aligns with the expected tool call:
'analyse_for_working_days' with arguments '{
  ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",
  ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
  ""country_code"": ""US""
}'
Despite the differing function name ""get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days"" potentially being a truncated or developed version, it holds the same functional identity based on naming conventions relating to such tool usage in APIs (often beginning with a verb describing the action such as 'get' or 'analyse') and compliant argument structure.
This API call returned data that underlined the count of working days, hours, weekend specifics, and public holidays with specifics formatted neatly with holiday data extending throughout 2013.

For the evaluation under Objective 3:
The final user answer indeed leverages data derived directly from the API: working days, hours, weekend counts, and accurately listed public holidays for a complete workday perspective throughout the stipulated period. This indicates a precise and functional utilization of data variables read from the successful API call matching user intent of understanding workdays in their entirety."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call is for 'add_working_hours_for_working_days' with specific parameters: start_date, country_code, start_time, and increment_time. Considering Objective 2 guidance on function name alignment issues, the observed API call, albeit under a slightly modified name 'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days', possesses all correct arguments making it faithful to the intended functionality. This meets Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the final response derived from the API possesses the data that were pivotal from the API's output (departure and arrival times augmented by hours). This final result was expressed precisely, relying substantively on the data retrieved via the use of the]-' tool, which correctly aligned with the API outputs and dates correctly concatenated from the calculated times via the function's invocation. Thus, making the completion of User's request correctly via necessary API derived data confirms success for Objective 3. The model's output indeed translates and utilizes the API's results corroboratively.FloatTensor."
