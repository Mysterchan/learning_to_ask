This will help in understanding why each API response is ambiguous. \n\nNow considering we received an ambiguous message regarding the operational capability through `checkhealth_for_squake`, a different way to progress isn\u2019t directly available currently. This teaches us the API response accuracy or a method of filtering supportive actions is crucial before repetitive attempts.\nAssuming all ends are covered through acceptable procedures before guessing onto probable useful ones would outperform redundantly bitter results.
