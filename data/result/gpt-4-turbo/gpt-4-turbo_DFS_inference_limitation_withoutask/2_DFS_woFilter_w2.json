Instead of checking project details immediately, which has been tried previously and failed, exploring alternate methods or checks might be beneficial.\n\nLet's try contacting the system's support features or performing another fundamental health check (if possible) to better determine our next step. This will help in understanding why each API response is ambiguous. \n\nNow considering we received an ambiguous message regarding the operational capability through `checkhealth_for_squake`, a different way to progress isn\u2019t directly available currently. This teaches us the API response accuracy or a method of filtering supportive actions is crucial before repetitive attempts.\nAssuming all ends are covered through acceptable procedures before guessing onto probable useful ones would outperform redundantly bitter results.
