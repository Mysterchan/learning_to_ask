Consequently, I believe the current tools will not be helpful in fulfilling the user mundane query to \"Get subtitles for a Vimeo video with the ID '12345abc'.\"\n\nMy action now will be to conclude this attempt by informing us of an inability to perform the task using the available tools and recommend a restart.\n\nI'll call the Finish function to execute this decision.",
