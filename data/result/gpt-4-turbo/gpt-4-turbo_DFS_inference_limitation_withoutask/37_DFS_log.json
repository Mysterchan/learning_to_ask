Without relevant data sources or other APIs to handle this specific query regarding car ownership history, a database-search or specific auto data query tool would be required.\n\nSince the platform and tools currently accessed do not provide the specific functionality needed to procure ownership history on a particular vehicle's VIN, I will conclude this task.",
