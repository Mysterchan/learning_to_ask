Thus, without having the appropriate function to pull specific user data from Facebook, demonstrate usage or present the desired data, I'm inclined to finish this attempt and recommend perhaps providing more appropriate tools or direct API access to Facebook in future attempts.\n\nNow, I'll complete this attempt with an appropriate response related to task capabilities.",
