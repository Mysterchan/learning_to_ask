None of my accessible tools are explicitly equipped to directly address natural language processing or sentiment analysis, particularly related to multimedia content or reviews.\n\nTo move action forward and wrap up my planned steps:\n1. Recognize that this specific task of analyzing sentiments of reviews falls out of the tools' functionality range directly available to me.\n2. Propose either recommending a different service specialized in sentiment analysis or admitting the limitation of current search scopes and capabilities with this task context.\n\nNext, I will conclude the task since we cannot proceed with analyzing sentiments directly using the available functions.",
