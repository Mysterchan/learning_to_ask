Squake specializes in sustainability products, specifically related to carbon emissions and certified climate initiatives, which doesn't provide information for geolocating IP addresses directly.\n\nAction Approach:\nTo handle user query correctly, it's essential to communicate openly that the current tools and implementations cannot serve this specific request.\n\nNext Step:\nInitiate the \"Finish\" function to resolve the situation by either restarting or ending this cycle of interactions based on available functionality. I will proceed to signal that the current capabilities are not able to fulfill the user's query on IP address geolocation.",
