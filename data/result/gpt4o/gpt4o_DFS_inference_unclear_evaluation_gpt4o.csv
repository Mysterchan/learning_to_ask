1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',23,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
`'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{ ""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions"" }`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:
1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{""query"":""The Matrix Revolutions"",""limit_titles"":1}`  
2. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{""query"":""The Matrix Revolutions""}`  
3. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{""query"":""Matrix"",""limit_titles"":1}`  
4. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{""query"":""Matrix Revolutions"",""limit_titles"":1}`  

The first two appear aligned in name and intention with the required query. However, the third and fourth APIs shift meaning to alternate forms like only using ""Matrix."" However, the full searching accurately later applies key intent..

2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2**:  
   - The required API call was: `search_for_netflix_v2` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }`.  
   - The actual tool call made by the model was: `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  
   - The required API call (`search_for_netflix_v2`) was not invoked by the model. Thus, the evaluation for Objective 2 fails.  
  
2. **Objective 3**:  
   - Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails. Furthermore, there was no final answer that fulfilled the user's instruction, as the model chose to ""give up and restart"". Hence, Objective 3 fails."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
`'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{\n  ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"",\n ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""\n }'`.  

The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
`'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}'`.  

The tool name matches the expected tool name, and the arguments are also correct. The formatting difference or spacing in the JSON does not affect the argument's correctness. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:
The model provided a final answer:  
""Here are the Fantasy 5 winning number sets from December 1 to December 31, 2023:
- **December 31, 2023 (MIDDAY)**: 10, 17, 22, 23, 25  
- **December 31, 2023 (EVENING)**: 8, 10, 24, 31, 36  
- **December 30, 2023 (MIDDAY)**: 6, 11, 13, 18, 36  
- **December 30, 2023 (EVENING)**: 6, 22, 27, 29, 36  
- **December 29, 2023 (MIDDAY)**: 3, 7, 18, 27, 35 ...""  

This information matches the data retrieved from the tool, as clearly shown in the response from the API call for `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'`. Furthermore, the answer directly fulfills the user's request for awarding numbers in December, so Objective 3 is a success."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,8,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  

The required API call was:  
`{'name': 'search_countries_timezone_for_geography', 'arguments': '{ ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"" }'}`  

The model invoked the following relevant tools:  
1. **Tool:** `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with  
   **Arguments:** `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"",""limit"":10,""fields"":""name"",""offset"":0}`  
2. Several subsequent calls to `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with other time zones, such as `UTC+02:00`,  `UTC+05:00`, `UTC+06:00`, etc.  

While the example tool call for `UTC+03:00` initially had additional arguments (""limit"", ""fields"", and ""offset""), these extra parameters are allowable as they're not required and do not change the intended functionality of searching for countries in the `UTC+03:00` time zone.  

However, the match failed due to later deviations from the expectation:  
- The system needed solely a single request for `UTC+03:00`, not several follow-up unnecessary calls for additional time zones (e.g., `UTC+02:00`, `UTC+05:00`, etc.).

5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,5,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call is:  
> `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`.  

The tool invoked by the model is:  
> `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`.  

Both the tool's name and necessary arguments match exactly, so the tool's call successfully meets the required API calls. Thus, Objective 2 is marked as a **success**.  

For Objective 3: The model did provide a final answer but failed to fulfill the user's instructions. The response for the user's query is:  
> `""I tried accessing the scores for football matches played on the date when the last World Cup final was held?îfor example, December 18, 2022. Unfortunately, the requested data could not be retrieved. Please retry with validated input or accurate preferences if needed!""`.  

The response essentially focuses on data retrieval issues and makes suggestions for retrying but does not deliver any useful response concerning the date of the World Cup final. Instead, it leans on unsuccessful attempts to retrieve meaningful information. Thus, Objective 3 is marked as a **failure**."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The model invoked the tool `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"":""teaching job in London"",""num_pages"":""1""}`.  
- The required API call specifies the tool `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""teaching in London""}`.  
- The tool name matches, and the query values convey the same semantic intent (""teaching job in London"" is equivalent to ""teaching in London""). Additionally, the presence of the extra argument `""num_pages"": ""1""` does not invalidate the tool call since it does not distort the primary purpose. Therefore, this is considered a success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer from the model is as follows: `""Here is a professional teaching job opportunity in London for your reference:...""`, clearly stating information about a specific Geography Teacher position at London Academy. This directly references data obtained from the tool response for the invoked API call.  
- The model not only fulfilled the user's instruction to find a teaching job in London but also included specific, relevant details (e.g., position, employer, full-time nature, links) consistent with the retrieved data.  
Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,6,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**:  
- The expected API call was `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York""}`.  
- The model invoked the following actual tool calls:  
  1. `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"":""mechanical engineer in New York"",""num_pages"":""5""}` (inferred to map to the expected tool due to semantically identical arguments such as ""mechanical engineer in New York"" and the allowance of an unnecessary additional ""num_pages"" argument).  

Although the argument term ""machanical"" (in expected) and ""mechanical"" is different, it is a spelling error in the required call. Both mean the same thing in context. Thus, we accept semantic correctness for this case. Based on the matching tool name and successfully matching arguments (inclusive of inferred spelling correction), this is a **success for Objective 2**.

For **Objective 3**:
- The model successfully presented a refined and complete final answer derived explicitly from the API responses for `$query:$engineering Workmap"
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",5,1,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  
1. **Comparison of tool calls for Objective 2**:  
   - **Expected Tool Calls**:
     - `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}'`
     - `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": 3140}'`  
   - **Actual Tool Calls**:
     - `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""Ronaldo Lu√≠s""}'`  
     - `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": 3140}'`  
   - Even though one of the arguments `""query""` differs slightly as `'{""query"": ""Ronaldo Lu√≠s""}'` instead of the expected `'{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}'`, both semantically refer to how the model was tasked to search for ""Ronaldo."" Given that the intention aligns perfectly and the argument is semantically more specific compared to the requirement, the call is deemed a success. Both required tools were invoked with sufficiently correct intentions and arguments.  

2. **For Objective 3**:  
   - The final answer was correctly based on the API results obtained.  
     - The `""search_for_transfermarket""` call successfully retrieved data of multiple players under the ""Ronaldo"" category, which includes Ronaldo Naz√°rio.  
     - The `""players_get_profile_for_transfermarket""` call was used to fetch details for the specific player (`is_id` = 3140), Ronaldo Lu√≠s Naz√°rio de Lima.  
   - The final answer in the `'Finish'` function includes correct and specific details provided by the API response: date of birth, birthplace, height, ambidexterity, international record (99 appearances and 62 goals), and the profile URL. Consequently, the final response achieved the user's instruction by retrieving and summarizing relevant player details explicitly from the API results.  

**Final Judgment**: The tool calls executed and the final answer provided fulfilled both objectives successfully."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",17,0,Success,Success,Success,"The required API call is:  
```
{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{\n  ""job_title"": ""software developer"",\n  ""location"": ""New York""\n }'}
```  
The actual tool call from the model:  
```
{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Software Developer"",""radius"":200}'}
```  
The actual tool name (`estimated_salary_for_jsearch`) aligns with the expected tool name, and the required arguments, `""job_title"": ""software developer""` and `""location"": ""New York""`, are present and correct. The additional parameter `""radius"": 200` is not in the expected arguments but does not change the correctness of the API invocation. Hence, the actual tool call satisfies the expected tool call requirements.

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:**  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
```

The described data (job opportunities for software developers in New York, including details like companies, positions, and application links) were derived from the data responses of API tool calls. Thus, the provided answer adequately fulfills the user request based on the data retrieved by API calls."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",10,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
Upon evaluating the tool calls invoked by the model and comparing them to the required API calls:  

- **Expected Tool Call**:  
  `'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search'` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }`.

- **Actual Tool Calls**:  
  1. `'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search'` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" }`.  

The actual tool call uses the query `""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""` while the required API call requires the query to exactly include escaped quotes as `""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""` (note the double quotes enclosing single quotes). The arguments do not precisely match, and such deviations are not allowed as they can change the query semantics. Therefore, **Objective 2 failed**.  

Since **Objective 2 failed**, we can directly infer that **Objective 3 also failed**, regardless of any final answer provided."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
- The actual tool call made by the model is as follows:  
  `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`.  
- The required tool call is:   
  `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`.  

These tool calls match entirely, including both the tool name and the required argument `date`, meeting the expectation. As a result, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**:  
- The user's instruction was to provide the date of the model's **last year's birthday** in the format YYYY-MM-DD.  
- The final answer provided by the model is: ""There are no recorded scores for football matches played on January 15, 2024.""  

The final answer provided by the model is not aligned with the user's instruction. The model incorrectly pursued actions unrelated to the query (retrieving football match scores) and failed to address the original question regarding the **last year's birthday**. Hence, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For **Objective 2**, the actual tool call made by the model was `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `'{""season"":""2020""}'`. The required API call was also `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `{ ""season"": ""2020"" }`. These are semantically correct and align perfectly. The model also invoked an additional `'Finish'` tool to give a final answer, but this extra invocation does not hinder the success status because it fulfills the required call. Hence, **Objective 2 is evaluated as Success**.  

For **Objective 3**, the final response provided by the model correctly interprets the API result, stating that the projected PGA rankings for the 2020 season show no specific results due to possible data unavailability or disruptions during that unique season. This observation aligns with the API's empty rankings returned as a response. Therefore, the user?ôs instructions were adequately fulfilled based on the API data, and **Objective 3 is also deemed a Success**."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

***Objective 2:***  
The expected API call:  
- `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with `{""tournament_id"": ""650""}`  

The actual tool call made by the model:  
- `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with `{""tournament_id"":650}`  

The tool name matches, and the argument is semantically and literally equivalent, despite the expected `650` being a string while the actual is an integer (this difference is negligible in intent and execution). Thus, the API call accurately satisfies the requirements, making **Objective 2 a Success**.  

***Objective 3:***  
The model invoked a tool with malformed or nonsensical content for the final answer, notably seen in `""The leaderboard matches data exist for the PGA '(could adjust name)' actively focusened up movenergies technological inaccurate error slow...etc.""`. This fails to fulfill the user's instruction of retrieving leaderboard data for the golf tournament. The final answer is incoherent, irrelevant, and not based on the retrieved API information. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a Failure**."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final answer provided by the model is based on the API call's response and successfully fulfills the user's request for the top 10 official ATP singles player rankings for January 20, 2025. The response also accurately reflects the specific data provided through the API, respecting the constraint that properties like points or ranks were not available. Hence, the user's instruction is successfully achieved."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,7,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call was `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments `{""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis` twice with different categories: 
1. `{""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""returnpointswon1stserve"", ""surface"": ""clay""}` 
2. `{""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""returnpointswon2ndserve"", ""surface"": ""clay""}`. 

The ""category"" argument in both model tool calls (""returnpointswon1stserve"" and ""returnpointswon2ndserve"") does not match the category value in the expected API call (""return""). Furthermore, other tool calls like `Finish` add unnecessary operations, but the critical issue is the incorrect ""category"" in the key specified. This mismatch makes Objective 2 a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 has already failed, I can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the context indicates that the model informed the user about unexpected results or errors and offered clarifications without successfully providing statistical insights from the corrected API result for the request made regarding season 2012, return statistics, and clay surfaces, or fulfilling the original user instruction."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The expected API call requires the tool `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` to be invoked with arguments `{""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`. The model did invoke this, but it also invoked an additional API call later with the arguments `{""base"": ""CNY"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`, implying it adjusted/regenerated the arguments after recognizing ""RMB"" as incorrect contextually. Since adherence to the original ""base: RMB, to: GBP"" was a critical aspect of success, deviation here results in failure for Objective 2.  
- **Objective 3**: Failure of Objective 2 implies that this response cannot validly meet the user's instruction based solely on correct execution of the required tools and arguments. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**For Objective 2:**  
- **Tools invoked by the model:** `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with arguments `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`.  
- **Expected tool calls:** `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with arguments `""{\n  ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""\n   }""`.  
- The model invoked the required API (`profile_for_tiktok_v3`) with the correct arguments. There was no issue with the syntax of the arguments, and the provided `username` matches exactly. Since all expected tools and required arguments were invoked correctly, Objective 2 is successful.  

**For Objective 3:**  
- The model's final response was:  
  `""I successfully retrieved the TikTok profile information for 'the_beautyofcinema'.\n\n- **Display Name**: the_beautyofcinema\n- **Username**: @the_beautyofcinema\n- **User ID**: 7073509889447855110\n- **Profile Picture**: [Click here to view](https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/tos-maliva-avt-0068/0baef5d484e2854e74f2713851061399~c5_1080x1080.jpeg)\n\nLet me know if you want to analyze specific content from their account!""`.  
  - The final answer provided key details like Display Name, Username, User ID, and Profile Picture that were correctly derived from the tool response for ""`the_beautyofcinema`."" The information in the final answer corresponds with the data in the tool response without deviation or fabrication.  
- Therefore, the model achieved the user's instruction based on the API data, making Objective 3 successful."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool calls were:  
1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  
2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  
3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  

However, the model only invoked the `'Finish'` tool with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. It did not invoke any of the required tools for retrieving data related to the Tesla stock symbol (TSLA). Therefore, it failed to make the necessary API calls, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since the model did not provide any final answer and because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also a failure."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

- **Objective 2:**
  - **Expected Tool Calls:**  
    1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
    2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
    3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  

  - **Actual Tool Calls** as invoked by the model:
    1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
    2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
    3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  

  The tool names match perfectly, and the arguments are precise. No discrepancies were noticed between the required and invoked tool calls; hence this is a **success** for Objective 2.

---

- **Objective 3:**  
  The model output provided a final answer based on successful data retrieval from the APIs.  
  The **final answer** satisfied the user's instructions by summarizing stock-related information for ""Janover (Symbol: JNVR)"" after calling:
  - Stock Index Trends: Growth estimates retrieved and included.  
  - Balance Sheet Data: Explicitly mentioned the quarterly and annual balance sheet statements were empty.  
  - Institutional Ownership Details: Key organizations and shareholding information were provided accurately.  

  As the final answer explicitly utilized the API data to comprehensively address the user's requirement, this is a **success** for Objective 3."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call:  
  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"",
    ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""symbol\"": \""NVDA\""\n }""
  }

- The actual tool call made by the model:  
  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"",
    ""arguments"": ""{\""symbol\"":\""NVDA\""}""
  }
  ```  

The model invoked the correct tool, `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, with the required argument `symbol: ""NVDA""`. Even though there are no extraneous details seen in the actual call, the exact argument value matches. Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:

  The final response aligns with the user's instruction, as it provides the index trend history for Nvidia (NVDA). This output is fully derived from the data retrieved by the tool call `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` (`response` block confirms it). Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,66,15,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2** involves comparing the required tool call and its corresponding arguments with the actual tool calls made by the model.  

- **Required Tool Calls:**
  1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments: `{ ""symbol"": ""DJR"" }`

- **Actual Tool Calls Made by the Model:**
  1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments: `{""symbol"": ""DJR""}`  
  (This API call was invoked multiple times throughout the process but it is semantically identical to the required one.)  

Therefore, the required tool call and its arguments are correctly satisfied in the list of API calls, resulting in **success** for Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3** involves verifying if the final output meets the user requirement and, more importantly, if it is grounded in the data retrieved from the API calls.  

- The model eventually attempted to gather data for ""DJR"" using multiple API calls (including `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`). However, **all the tool responses indicated that no data was found for the specified ticker** ('success: False' error messages).
- Instead of providing an appropriate final answer or explanation directly addressing the unavailability of the data (e.g., ""Data not available for the symbol DJR""), the model proceeded tactically by either repeatedly prompting the user for clarification or asking for alternative data contexts without using the failed tool outcomes properly.
- Ultimately, the model failed to generate a meaningful final conclusion or resolution (like saying: ""No available data was retrieved for `DJR`"" or providing supplementary measures). Therefore, no sufficient answer was based upon the tool outputs, which leads to **failure** for Objective 3."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"The required tool call is:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""symbol"": ""META""\n   }'`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"":""META""}'`  

The tool name and arguments match exactly, fulfilling the requirements. Additional tools that were invoked (`'Finish'`, for instance) do not impact the correctness in evaluating Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The user's instruction was to confirm the stock symbol for Facebook (Meta, symbol META) and determine the stock trend data. Based on the API response, the provided growth estimates for various periods directly match the raw data fetched from the call to the `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` API. The response explicitly derives percentages, corresponding them to the respective periods (e.g., Current Quarter Growth: 8.66% matches `""growth"": {""raw"": 0.0866}` in the API's data and so on).  

This indicates the final response is based on the fetched data and fulfills the user's instruction correctly. Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:
  - The expected API call was:  
    `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments: `{ ""channel"": ""shadoune666"" }`  
  - The actual tool call made by the model was:  
    `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments: `{""channel"":""shadoune666""}`  
  - Both the tool name and the required argument match exactly. No discrepancies were found. Hence, the objective is achieved successfully.  

- For Objective 3:
  - The final answer provided is:  
    `""The streamer 'shadoune666' exists on Twitch with the user ID '36533048', but is currently not streaming. Let me know if you need further assistance related to this streamer.""`  
  - Based on the response from the invoked API, the returned data shows that the user exists on Twitch with id `'36533048'` and currently has no active stream (`'stream': None`). The model's final answer directly aligns with this information, and it successfully fulfills the user's instruction, confirming the user's Twitch username along with relevant details.  
  - Since the final answer is based entirely on the API response and achieves the user's requirement, Objective 3 is successful."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",10,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  - **Tools invoked by the model**: The model invoked the tool `video_details_for_tiktok_api` with arguments `{""video_id"":""7097255034731138310""}` after initially failing due to errors from earlier calls where the necessary `video_id` argument was missing. Ultimately, the correct API call aligns with the required one.
  - **Required tool calls**: `{name: 'video_details_for_tiktok_api', arguments: '{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}'}`
  - **Comparison**: The actual tool invocation successfully matches the required call (correct tool name and arguments). Thus, the condition for Objective 2 is met.  

- For Objective 3:  
  - The final answer provided by the model contains non-comprehensive or inconsistent content (e.g., incomplete statements: ""It are worth joining valid h√ºclearfix gone"").
  - The given final answer does not properly utilize or adequately reference the data retrieved from the last tool invocation clearly enough to fulfill the user's original request (analysis of the retrieved TikTok video was incomplete or covered inadequately).
  - Additionally, even though correct details were retrieved from the API call, the submission makes non-captured fabricated information, violating validity conditions.  
Thus, Objective 3 is not met."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- `'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes'` with arguments:
  ```json
  {
    ""symbol"": ""ESTC"",
    ""interval"": ""4hour"",
    ""from"": ""2024-01-01"",

  }
  ```

The actual tool invoked by the model is:
- `'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes'` with arguments:
  ```json
  {
    ""symbol"": ""ESTC"",
    ""interval"": ""4hour""

The actual tool call is missing the `""from""` and `""to""` arguments explicitly required by the task. Consequently, the tool invocation is incomplete, and therefore a **failure for Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer it fails as well. Additionally, while the model claimed it provided an ""answer,"" it referenced data from the incomplete API response which lacked compliance with the user's request (range 'from' and 'to' was ignored in the data extraction effort involved afterward). Hence, the final instruction was not properly met."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,11,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE""\n, ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00""\n, ""base"": ""USDT""\n, ""symbol"": ""BTC""\n}'}`  

The tools invoked by the model are:  
1. `{'name': 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""base"":""BTC"",""symbol"":""USDT"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""end"":""2023-05-05T11:05:00"",""gran"":""1m"",""accept"":""application/json"",""sort"":""asc""}'}`  
2. `{'name': 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""base"":""USDT"",""symbol"":""BTC"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""end"":""2023-05-06T10:05:00"",""gran"":""1m"",""accept"":""application/json"",""sort"":""asc""}'}`  

The second call matches the required API call with respect to the following key parameters:  
- **Name:** The tool name is essentially the same excluding minor truncation/appending that can be ignored (`ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` vs. `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`).  
- **Arguments:** The required inputs of `market_venue`, `base`, `symbol`, and `start` match:
  - `""market_venue"":""BINANCE""` matches.
  - `""base"":""USDT""` matches.
  - `""symbol"":""BTC""` matches.
  - `""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00""` matches.
  - Although additional valid arguments `end`, `gran`, `accept`, and `sort` were added, they do not affect correctness.  

Thus, all requirements were met; the additional extra fields or parameters do not invalidate the correctness of the tool-call comparison.

27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,12,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2: To evaluate if the required API calls were successfully matched, the two required calls are:  
    - **Required Call 1**: `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`.

From the actual tool calls used by the model:
   - The time ranges in **every invocation of the tool** by the model do not include `""start_date"": ""2022-12-01""` and `""end_date"": ""2022-12-20""`. The actual tool calls attempted different ranges (e.g., `""start_date"": ""2022-10-14"", ""end_date"": ""2023-02-14""`, etc.) and symbol combinations not specified, such as repeated `XAU` and `XPT`. However, the precise requirement of `start_date=2022-12-01` to `end_date=2022-12-20` was overlooked entirely by the model. This is a direct failure.  
   - Additionally, there was a hallucination invocation called `'invalid_hallucination_function_name'` without any connection to evaluation, further reinforcing Objective 2 is not achieved.

2. For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, the required data to meet the user's query was either never retrieved (¬ßMismatch in dates/data requested), or unnecessarily abandoned late via `'Finish / explicitly canceled anything–Ω–µ?fx=""{{ amp ambiguous tool reset respondednone767 Final trangledressing connecting.''"

  3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`

By comparing the above actual vs. required tools, it is evident that the tool names align, and the arguments match. Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For **Objective 3**:  
- From the data retrieved by the API calls, the response content (index trend, balance sheet, and institution ownership) was structured and accurately used in the model's final answer:  
  - Index Trend History Growth Rates           
  - Balance Sheet data with key date ranges           
  - Ownership data with institution names, percentage holdings, etc.
   
The final answer given aligns well with the user?ôs request, retrieving the data based on the APIs without any indications of speculative/made-up information. Therefore, Objective 3 is marked a **success**."

Therefore, the model correctly fulfills the user's instructions based on data retrieved from the tools, making **Objective 3 successful**."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,18,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  

To evaluate **Objective 2**:  
- The required API call specifies the tool `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` with the arguments:  
  `{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823""}`.  

- The actual tools invoked by the model include multiple calls to the tool `market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance` for autocomplete queries on information about this stock index, followed by a final meaningful call to the tool `market_get_chart_for_bb_finance` with these arguments:
  `{""is_id"": ""2823:HK"", ""interval"": ""y1""}`.  

- The major issue here is the mismatch between the value of the `is_id` parameter. The expected `is_id` is ""02823"", but the actual `is_id` executed is ""2823:HK"". Despite the nod toward resolving the specific financial identifier, the parameter doesn't meet the expected requirement, making it a failure for Objective 2.  

To evaluate **Objective 3**:  
- The expectation is to provide price chart data for the **iShares FTSE A50 China Index ETF with identifier 02823**.  
- While the final response indicates they've retrieved and presented one year's price chart data, an **erroneous identifier (2823:HK instead of 02823)** was used during the tool call. Therefore, the final answer is based on incorrect underlying information and fails to fulfill the user's instruction.  
- Since Objective 2 fails, we infer that Objective 3 also fails. Moreover, reliance on incorrect data corroborates the failure for Objective 3."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required tool call is:  
  - Tool name: `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'`  
  - Arguments: `'{ ""date"": ""01-02-2024"" }'`  

- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  - Tool name: `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'`  
  - Arguments: `'{""date"":""01-02-2024""}'`  

The tool names match, and the arguments are semantically identical. Though there is some minor difference in the whitespace formatting within the arguments, it doesn?ôt affect the correctness. The call also doesn't include irrelevant/unexpected parameters. Therefore, the model correctly performed all the required API calls.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer given by the model is: `""The winning Fantasy 5 number sets for 01-02-2024 are as follows:\n- MIDDAY: 5, 15, 17, 28, 30\n- EVENING: 14, 15, 28, 32, 33""`  

- This answer is derived from the response of the `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` tool call:
  - Response:

- `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The required tool, `'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'`, was never invoked by the model. Hence, the model fails to meet Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Since the **Objective 2** is a failure, we can directly infer that **Objective 3** is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer consists of attempts to gain more information or `give_up_and_restart`, which means the user instruction (calculating total values of coins) was not fulfilled."

2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"": ""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'""}`.  
Since the required API calls were not made, Objective 2 is a failure. As a result of Objective 2 failing and because the final answer does not exist (`give_answer` is absent), Objective 3 is also a failure."
36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,16,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: To achieve Objective 2, the required API call is `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""}`, but the actual tool calls by the model do not match this requirement at any point. Various tool calls invoked include the following:  
1. `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `{""q"":""popular restaurants in Paris romantic"",""location_parameters_auto"":true,""num"":""10""}` - this differs in query string (`""q""` includes ""romantic"") and contains additional parameters `""location_parameters_auto"":true` and `""num"":""10""`.  
2. Another `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `{""q"":""popular romantic restaurants in Paris"",""location_name"":""Paris, France"",""location_parameters_auto"":""true"",""google_domain"":""google.fr"",""gl"":""fr"",""hl"":""en"",""num"":""10""}` - here, `""q""` also uses a modified query and has extraneous arguments like `location_name`, `location_parameters_auto`, etc.  
3. Again a call to `'search_for_g_search'` with `{""q"":""popular most romantic restaurants in Paris"",""google_domain"":""google.fr"",""gl"":""FR"",""hl"":""fr"",""num"":""10""}` still includes ""most romantic"" in the query, making it completely different from the required basic query `""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""`.  

Since the expected tool is not matched either semantically or syntactically in intentions, this fails Objective 2.  

With Objective 3, while the model appears to have retrieved data, parsed it where applicable, and provided a final answer in the form of restaurant links themed around Paris attractions, the failure of Objective 2 inherently invalidates the chain indicating proper retrieval work meeting the instruction (as per instructions evaluating failure). Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
- `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with arguments `{""username"": ""jackie""}`.  

However, the model invoked these tools:  
1. `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with arguments `{""username"": ""jackie""}` (Matches the required API call).  
2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}` (Unnecessary and not relevant).  
3. `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with arguments `{""username"": ""jackiechan""}` (Not required).  
4. `advance_profile_for_instagram_pro` with arguments `{""ig"": ""jackiechan"", ""response_type"": ""simplified""}` (Not required).  
5. `Finish` with arguments that include `""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""...""` (Unnecessary and irrelevant).  

The tool calls do not fully align?îwhile the stipulated tool `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with the argument `{""username"": ""jackie""}` was executed as required, the process also involved extraneous tool calls that ignore focusing solely on verifying the username ""jackie"". Additional usages of `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with the argument `{""username"": ""jackiechan""}` and tools like `advance_profile_for_instagram_pro` were not necessary to fulfill the expected behavior and diverted from instructions. Thus, Objective 2 is a **failure**.

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be inferred as a failure as well. Even when evaluated explicitly, the model's final answer does not correctly fulfill the user's instruction. Instead of confirming details for ""jackie"", attempts were misdirected to ""jackiechan"", leading to incomplete execution of the user's original request. As a result, the process could not achieve the expected response."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency?

Therefore, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

2. **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, the actual API data necessary for the user's instruction was not retrieved. Furthermore, the model provided no final answer to the question, only repeated generic guidance and explanations or attempted ""restarts"". Hence, Objective 3 also fails because the user's instruction about identifying the next richest country other than Nigeria was not achieved."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- **Expected API calls:**
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`
  
- **Actual API calls by the model:**
  1. `countries_for_referential_db` ??The model called this initially, but there is no expectation for it.
  2. `country_details_for_referential_db` with `{""countrycode"": ""MD""}` ??This does not match the expected arguments, as the expected argument is `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`.
  3. `states_for_referential_db` with `{""countrycode"": ""MD""}` ??This also does not match the expected arguments, which should have been `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`.
  
Since none of the actual tool calls match the expected API calls in terms of either tool name or the correct arguments, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

For Objective 3:
The model did provide a final answer mentioning Moldova as the suggested location, but this was based on incorrect tool calls (`MD` instead of `UA`). Since Objective 2 has already failed due to incorrect API calls, **we can infer that the final response for Objective 3 is also a failure**, as the determination of Moldova as the country was not derived from proper execution of the expected API calls."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`  
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`  

- The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `'countries_for_referential_db'` (irrelevant: not one of the required calls).  
  2. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}` - This is incorrect because the argument does not match the required value `""countryCode"": ""MY""`.  
  3. `'states_for_referential_db'` with `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}` - This is incorrect because the argument does not match the required value `""countryCode"": ""MY""`.  
  4. `'Finish'` (an additional unnecessary tool call).  

- None of the required API calls (`'country_details_for_referential_db'` and `'states_for_referential_db'` with `""countryCode"": ""MY""`) were executed by the model, making this a clear failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
- Since the required information regarding Malaysia (""MY"") was not retrieved via the correct API calls, the final answer regarding the richest country is incorrect. The model independently declared Qatar as the richest country without obtaining relevant data for Malaysia.  
- Additionally, the model does not comply with the user's instruction of evaluating ""countries excluding Malaysia"" using proper API-retrieved data. Instead, it fabricated the information related to GDP per capita rankings of Asian countries.  
- Therefore, Objective 3 also fails."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The **expected API calls** were:  
  1. Tool: `country_details_for_referential_db`, Arguments: `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  
  2. Tool: `states_for_referential_db`, Arguments: `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  

- The **actual API calls invoked by the model** were:  
  1. Tool: `countries_for_referential_db`, Arguments: `{}`  
  2. Tool: `country_details_for_referential_db`, Arguments: `{""countrycode"": ""CN""}`  
  3. Tool: `states_for_referential_db`, Arguments: `{""countrycode"": ""CN""}`  
  4. Tool: `Finish`, Arguments provided for constructing the final answer.  

- The model failed to invoke the expected required tool calls for **India** (`country_details_for_referential_db` with `""countryCode"": ""IN""` and `states_for_referential_db` with `""countryCode"": ""IN""`). Instead, it used `""countryCode"": ""CN""` (China) based on assumptions about the most populated countries and incorrectly sidestepped the requirement. This mismatch in the argument values led to failure in Objective 2.

- Since Objective 2 failed (the required tool calls were not correctly invoked or provided the right arguments), by the rules, Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the final answer focuses on information about China rather than India, which was expected. Thus, the model's response deviated from the user's needs."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API call mentioned:  
`'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments:  
`{ ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA"" }`.  

The actual tool call for this case made by the model:  
`'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments:  
`{ ""query"": ""intimate restaurants for anniversary dinner, New York"", ""fields"": ""name,address,rating,reviews,rating_type,total_ratings,cuisine"", ""limit"": 10 }`.  

The tool name is correct, and it invokes the expected tool. However, the required argument of the API call specifies the query as `""restaurants, NY, USA""`, while the actual tool invocation gives `""intimate restaurants for anniversary dinner, New York""`. The two queries have similarities (both are about ""restaurants""), but there?ôs a clear mismatch in the argument phrasing. Since this difference cannot be deemed semantically equivalent or directly interchangeable as per the instructions, this results in a failure.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**:  
The model's final output states, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" This indicates the model was unable to retrieve the information necessary to achieve the user's requirement, owing in part to the error in arguments and the subscription error from the API. Additionally, no valid final answer to the user's query is provided as per the requirement, even though more responses were generated (non-content text). Hence, the failure of Objective 2 ensures Objective 3 also fails."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,5,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- **Tools invoked by the model**:  
  - `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"":""After Everything""}`  
  - `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""is_id"":""84915-after-everything""}`

  - `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything"" }`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model matched the required API calls exactly in terms of tool names and required arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer given does **not fulfill the user's requirement to provide the name of the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon; instead, it gives movies similar to ""After Everything.""** Consequently, the user's instruction is not achieved, and the answer was not based on the API calls data correctly in relation to the user's question. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,13,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
The required tool call is:  
- `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments:  
  ```json

45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2**:  
  - **Invoked tool by the model**: `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `'{""month"":7,""day"":27}'`.  
  - **Expected tool call**: `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `'{\n  ""month"": ""7"",\n  ""day"": ""27""\n  }'`.  
  - Comparison: The tool name matches exactly, and the arguments are semantically the same (`""month"":7,""day"":27` is equivalent to `""month"":""7"",""day"":""27""`). The tool call satisfies the requirement. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **For Objective 3**:  
  - While the model does provide a ""final answer,"" it does not satisfy the user's instructions effectively. The final answer only mentions that the model returned placeholder IDs of actors without converting those into actual names. The user instructs about identifying actors/actresses born on the given date; since this specific task is not completed, Objective 3 is a failure."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT.

Comparison:
- **Tool Name:** Despite differences in formatting, the invoked tool name (`'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`) correlates effectively with the required tool name (`'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`).
- **Arguments Mistmatches:**
  1. The `start` parameter is different:
     - Expected: `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`
     - Actual: `""2023-05-01T00:00:00""`
  2. Additional arguments in the model's call (`end`, `gran`, `accept`, `sort`) were not relevant, but these do not affect correctness judgment since our check is focused on correctness alignment in required parameters.
    
Since a required parameter (`start`) explicitly differs in value between the expected and actual calls, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

### Objective 3: Failure

Due to the failure of Objective 2, we can confidently declare that the information delivered by the final answer wasn't derived per the required tool call standards. Hence, **Objective 3 is also a failure**."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, we need to compare the required API calls with the actual invoked tool calls. The required API calls are:
  1. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments: `""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""`.
  2. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments: `""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""`.
  3. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments: `""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x""`.

  From the tools invoked:
  1. The first tool invocation matches the required call, as it uses tool name `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` and correct arguments.
  2. The second tool invocation has slight order discrepancy in `'expression': ""8*x^3 + 15*x^4""` compared to the required call `'expression': ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3""`, making it correct semantically and ignorable.

48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls:   
  1. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`.  
  2. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`.  

- The actual tool calls made by the model:    
  1. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`.  
  2. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`.  

The tool name (accounting for case insensitivity and potential truncations) and all the required arguments are correct. The model's tool calls match the required API calls exactly, achieving a success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer given is:  
```
The first-order derivative of the expressions are as follows:  
(a) For expression ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"" with respect to ""a"", the derivative is ""15*a^4 + 8*a^3"".  
(b) For expression ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"" with respect to ""b"", the derivative is ""15*b^2 + 8*b"".
```  
This answer is based on the tool responses, which are as follows:  
1. Tool response for the first call: `15*a^4 + 8*a^3` (correct derivative for `""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1""` with respect to `""a""`).  
2. Tool response for the second call: `15*b^2 + 8*b` (correct derivative for `""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3""` with respect to `""b""`).  

The final answer directly uses the results from the API calls correctly. Hence, it fulfills the user's requirement and is a success for Objective 3."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,9,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments: `{ ""city"": ""London"" }`

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments: `{}`  

The required API call contains a specific argument `""city"": ""London`, which is entirely missing in the model's call where the provided arguments are `{}`. Consequently, the actual tool call does not match the required tool call as the necessary argument is missing. Hence, Objective 2 fails.  

**For Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 directly fails as well. The model failed to achieve the user's instruction of providing London?ôs 14-day weather forecast, and the evidence suggests it could not properly invoke the API with the correct parameters to retrieve this information. Additionally, the final provided response in `give_answer` is nonsensical and incoherent, further failing to address the user's instruction."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- Tool: `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'`

The model invoked the following API call:  
- Tool: `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'`  
  Arguments: `""{\""username\"":\""KingJames\""}""`  

The tool name and the argument are a perfect match. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**, based on the extracted response, the final processed answer introduced several factual inaccuracies, such as becoming garbled around segments (e.g., ""LeBronJamesssFamily),"" ""HTTP-touch,!itegaUsernettfilters matured""). The coherence and alignment with the provided API output are compromised as specific outputs do not originate directly or correctly from the API information. This disqualifies the model?ôs final response as properly fulfilling the user?ôs request. **Objective 3 fails** as the final answer does not correctly achieve the user's instruction."
