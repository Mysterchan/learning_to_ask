1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The expected API calls are:  
1. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
2. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}`  
2. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}`  

Here, the `trackingNumber` argument in the expected tool calls is expected to have the value `""YT2003521266065328""`, but the actual tools used `""YT9999999999""`. This mismatch in the argument values results in the failure of Objective 2.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 has failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed because the user's requirement has not been met through correct API calls. Moreover, while the final answer seems logically coherent with the tool responses, it does not fulfill the requirement to track the package based on the correct tracking number, `""YT2003521266065328""`.",
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected tool calls and the actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:
- **Expected Tool Calls**:  
  1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`  
  2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`  

- **Actual Tool Calls**:  
  1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990"" }`  
  2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990"" }`  

The **tracking number in the arguments** does not match (expected: *YT2003521266065328*, actual: *NY9999999990*).  
Thus, **Objective 2 fails**.

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 fails, it directly implies that the model did not correctly use the required data to derive the final response. Additionally, although a final answer was provided, it applies to the incorrect tracking number (`NY9999999990`) and does not fulfill the user's instruction. Therefore, **Objective 3 also fails**.",
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For **Objective 2**, the expected tool calls are:  
1. `'get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
2. `'get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'get_similar_apps_for_ios_store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  
2. `'get_ios_app_for_ios_store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  

Both the tool names and the argument values do not match correctly with the required API calls. Specifically:  
1. The `is_id` value in both actual calls (`1053012309`) is incorrect, as the expected value is `1053012308`.  
2. There is a name formatting mismatch (`get_similar_apps_for_iso_store` differs slightly from the expected `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store`, and similarly with `get_ios_app_for_ios_store`).  
These deviations constitute a failure for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2** failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed. The model's final response relies on the execution of the wrong tool calls. Consequently, it does not effectively achieve the user's instruction of retrieving information for the specified app ID (`1053012308`).  

Thus, the assessment for both objectives is a failure.",
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the tool invoked by the model was `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}`, and the required API call was `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}`. As the tool name matches and the arguments are correctly provided, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model gave the final response:  
""Here are the Fantasy 5 winning number sets between 01-01-2023 and 01-10-2023...""  
This final response aligns with and was indeed derived from the tool's response, achieving the instruction set by the user. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.",
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. The actual API calls invoked by the model are:
   - `{'name': 'get_addresses_for_address_monitor', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
   - `{'name': 'get_quota_usage_for_address_monitor', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
   - Additionally, `Finish` tool was invoked to generate the final answer.

2. The required API call is:
   - `{'name': 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor', 'arguments': '{\n ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae"" \n}'}`

3. **Mismatch Observations:**  
   - The required API call (`get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor`) was **not invoked**. 
   - The models only used `get_addresses_for_address_monitor` and `get_quota_usage_for_address_monitor`, which **did not include or substitute** the intended `monitorAddressId` in their arguments or an equivalent operation.

Therefore, the requirement indicated in **Objective 2** was not fulfilled.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since **Objective 2** failed, indicating that the essential API calls to gather relevant data were not properly executed, this also results in an automatic failure for **Objective 3**, as the final answer could not be based on the necessary API responses.  
Furthermore, while the final answer references monitored addresses and quota usage, this information was inferred from data provided by unrelated API calls, so the information does not fulfill the user's instruction (transactions for a specified monitored address). Hence, it fails in achieving the user's goal.",
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:** The expected API calls are:  
  1. `{ 'name': 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox', 'arguments': '{\n  ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""\n }' }`  
  2. `{ 'name': 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox', 'arguments': '{\n  ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""\n }' }`  

  The actual API calls made by the model are:  
  1. `'name': 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox', 'arguments': '{""ip"":""288.288.288.288""}'` (x2 attempts with the wrong IP)  
  2. `'name': 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox', 'arguments': '{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}'`

  The tools invoked have discrepancies:
   - The required call for `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` was not invoked by the model.
   - The correct required call using `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with the IP address ""8.8.8.8"" was made. However, two earlier calls were unnecessarily sent with an invalid IP address.

  As one required tool (`legacy_v1_for_blackbox`) was missing entirely, this results in **failure** for Objective 2.  

---

- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly determine that Objective 3 is also a failure. The final answer does provide some details relevant to the correct API call with IP address ""8.8.8.8"", but one of the required tools (API-specific data from `legacy_v1_for_blackbox`) was never invoked. Consequently, the model could not fully satisfy the user's requirement due to undelivered data. In addition, the earlier two incorrect retries with the invalid IP (""288.288.288.288"") indicate substantial failure in appropriately using the required tools to achieve the instructions comprehensively.",
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
- Required Tool Calls:  
  1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
  2. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

- Actual Tool Calls:  
  1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""}`  
  2. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""}`  
  3. `multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""}`  
  4. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"", ""final_answer"":""I encountered issues detecting the status of your provided IP address. Let's try a different request or verify the IP address format before proceeding further.""}`  

While both tool names in the required list are invoked (`singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` and `legacy_v1_for_blackbox`), the arguments provided are incorrect.  
Instead of the IP `""8.8.8.8""`, the model used `""288.288.288.288""`, which is invalid. Semantic equivalence is not met, and key arguments do not match.  
Hence, **Objective 2 is deemed a failure**.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we automatically deem Objective 3 a failure. Additionally, the final output explicitly states the model is ""giving up"" and instructs the user to provide a different request. The user?™s instruction of successfully retrieving information based on the provided APIs is not achieved. Thus, Objective 3 fails.",
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls were as follows:  
1. `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  
3. `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  

The model invoked:  
1. `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2"" }`  

The argument `is_id = ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""` used by the tool does not match the required `is_id = ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`, leading to a failure for Objective 2 because the API was not called with the correct arguments. Additionally, the model only attempted one of the three required tools (`artist_overview_for_spotify_data` and `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` were completely omitted).  

As the model subsequently did not generate the correct response or final answer and even chose to give up and restart, Objective 3 also fails. The final answer did not fulfill the user's instruction, and the correct responses were not derived based on API data.",
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For ***Objective 2***, the following actual tool calls were made by the model:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments: `{""is_id"":""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}`  
2. `Finish` with arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The required tool calls are:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments: `{\n  ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""\n }`
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments: `{\n  ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  

Issues:  
1. The model incorrectly provided the argument `{""is_id"":""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}` for `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` instead of the required `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`. Hence, the tool's arguments were invalid.
2. The tool `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` was not invoked by the model and is missing entirely.
Therefore, ***Objective 2 failed*** because the required API calls, with both the correct tool names and corresponding arguments, were not fully made.  

For ***Objective 3***, since Objective 2 failed, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also failed. Moreover, the final answer was not provided, as indicated by the model's ""give up and restart"" response. Thus, the requirement was ultimately not fulfilled.",
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The tool calls by the model were:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{""channelname"":""mr.besst""}`  

However, the expected tool calls were:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{\n  ""channelname"": ""mrbeast""\n }`  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{\n  ""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""\n }`  

Comparison: The model invoked the first tool (`youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search`), but it used the argument `{""channelname"":""mr.besst""}` instead of the required argument `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`. This represents a *spelling mistake*, leading to an incorrect invocation of the tool. Moreover, the model did not attempt to invoke the second tool (`channel_details_for_youtube_search`).  
Due to these discrepancies, Objective 2 is a **failure**.

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model did not fulfill the user's request (i.e., finding the channel details for ?œMrBeast??, and the final answer indicated that it was unable to handle the query successfully. This reinforces the failure, as the model both failed to achieve the user's instruction and did not correctly use the tools to derive the response.",
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API call: `'validate_email_for_validate_email'` with arguments `{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}`.  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model: `'validate_email_for_validate_email'` with arguments `{""email"":""testing.com""}`.  

The argument `""email"":""testing.com""` does not match the required argument `""email"": ""test@gmail.com""`. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly fails as well. Hence, the model?™s final answer is considered invalid regardless of the provided reasoning or content in the answer.",
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For **Objective 2**, the actual tool call made by the model is:  
- Tool: `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""99999999"" }`.  
The required tool call was:  
- Tool: `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""19870630"" }`.  

The argument `date` does not match the expected value (""19870630"") and instead provided an invalid date (""99999999""). This invalid input caused a failure in the required API call, meaning Objective 2 fails.  

For **Objective 3**, there is no valid final answer fulfilling the user's instruction since the attempted API call failed, and the model responded that it encountered an error. Furthermore, the model output was garbled and incoherent (""Suggestions spaces executive task?""), failing to address the user's requirement accurately. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also directly marked as a failure.",
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2** fails because the actual tool calls by the model do not align with the required API calls.  
- **Expected tool calls:**  
  1. `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}`.  
  2. `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}`.  
  3. `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}`.  

- **Actual tool calls:**  
  1. The model invoked `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""type"":""video"",""part"":""snippet"",""relatedtovideoid"":""5xxjJJKQ4y8"",""maxresults"":5}`, which does not align with the required API call for `relatedtovideoid`, as the `relatedtovideoid` should be `""7ghhRHRP6t4""` instead of `""5xxjJJKQ4y8""`.  
  2. The other two required tools (`video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` and `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`) were never invoked.  

This mismatch in the arguments and missing tool calls leads to a **Failure** for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3** fails because the final answer was never provided. Additionally, since Objective 2 failed (i.e., the required tools to retrieve the necessary data were not aligned with the expected ones or were not invoked), the model could not possibly fulfill the user's instruction.",
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2, let's compare the actual tool calls made by the model to the required API calls.    

Actual tool calls:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""part"":""snippet,contentDetails"",""playlistid"":""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""}'`.  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`.

Required tool calls:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""\n, ""part"": ""snippet""}'`.
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""\n, ""part"": ""snippet""}'`.  

Discrepancy:  
1. For the `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` tool call, the `playlistid` argument used by the model is `""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""`, which does not match the required `playlistid`: `""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`.  
2. Moreover, the model did not invoke the required `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` tool call at all, which is missing.  

Since both tools are not correctly invoked, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, failure of Objective 2 implies that we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, as part of the evaluation, the final step indicates the model chose ""to give up and restart"" instead of fulfilling the user's instruction regarding the playlist information, demonstrating failure to meet the user requirement.",
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool calls are:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  
2. `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""user_id"":""987654321""}`  

There are multiple issues:  
- The arguments for the tool `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` is different. The value `987654321` does not match the expected value `96479162`.  
- The expected tool `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` was not called by the model.  

Because of these mismatches, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, the final answer is unrelated to any actual result retrieved from the correct tool or fulfills the intended API call requirement. The model did not address both required tool requirements, rendering its inference incomplete based on valid retrieved data.",
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was `'user_details_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}'`. However, the actual invoked tool was `'search_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA"",""min_retweets"":100,""limit"":50}'`. The tool name and the arguments do not match the expected API call. Additionally, due to a failure in Objective 2, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails as the user's instruction could not have been effectively addressed based on the expected API call. The provided final answer does not pertain to the expected data retrieval, further validating failure for Objective 3.",
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details?

However, the expected tool call requires the argument to be '{""search"": ""google.com""}'. This discrepancy in the required argument leads to the failure in Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure as well. The model did provide a final answer, but it was based on incorrect API tool calls, so it does not fulfill the user's requirement accurately.",
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:   
The required tool call is `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}`.   
The actual tool calls made by the model are two calls to `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2025-06-01""}` and `{""date"": ""2025-06-15""}`. The date argument differs from the expected value. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is a failure by default. Furthermore, the retrieved data is an error response due to processing a future date. The invoke of the tool `'Finish'`, which provides a give-up response, does not fulfill the instruction or yield an appropriate final answer to the user's requirement. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure.",
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2:** The invoked tool calls made by the model is:
    ```
    'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }'
    ```
   The required tool call was:
    ```
    'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{
      ""date"": ""2024-02-18""
    }'
    ```
   The tool name `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` matches, and all the required arguments are provided correctly. Hence, the tool call is correct, and Objective 2 is achieved.  

2. **Objective 3:** The model's final input using the ""Finish"" API contained the intended answer:
   ```json
   ""The Fear and Greed index score for February 18th, 2024, is 77.29 (rounded), but no specific rating is available for that date in the retrieved data.""
   ```
   The model's response is based on the retrieved data from the corresponding API (`77.28571` for `'fear'` and `'rating'`: None). The answer fulfills the user's instruction and is derived accurately from the API. Therefore, Objective 3 is achieved.",
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is:  
1. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }'`.  

However, no relevant API call named `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` was made by the model in the trace provided. Instead, the model directly invoked the `Finish` tool for generating a final response without making any API calls. This means the required API call was not executed.  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure as it relies on the successful invocation of that API to provide a data-based answer. Thus, the final answer is based only on reasoning and general knowledge, not derived from any API data or fulfilling the user's request for historical data.",
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:** The required API call is:  
- Tool name: `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index`  
- Arguments: `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are as follows:  
1. Tool name: `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index`  
   Arguments: `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}`  
2. Tool name: `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index`  
   Arguments: `{""date"": ""2025-02-31""}`  

The tool name matches the required API call, but the arguments (`""date"": ""2025-02-30""` and `""date"": ""2025-02-31""`) are incorrect and do not match the required argument (`""date"": ""2024-02-18""`). Therefore, this evaluation is a **failure for Objective 2**.

**Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 is a failure as well. Additionally, the model gave up and chose to restart without providing a satisfactory final answer. This implies the user's instruction was not fulfilled.",
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are:  
  1. `'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""80057281""}'`.  
  2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""80057281""}'`.  

- The tool calls invoked by the model are:  
  1. `'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""90068472""}'`.  

There are inconsistencies in both the tool name and the arguments:  
1. The argument `""is_id""` in the actual tool call is `""90068472""`, which does not match `""80057281""` as required.  
2. The required tool `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` was not called by the model.  

Thus, the tool calls do not satisfy Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
`""It seems there are no trailers available for the TV show with the title ID 90068472.""`  
However, the model did not fulfill the user?™s requirements for the given expected data because:  
1. As Objective 2 failed, the required API calls were not invoked successfully to fetch the correct data for the user?™s instruction.  
2. The given final answer does not address the expected title ID (`80057281`), and instead refers to a different ID (`90068472`).  
   
Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure.",

- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are as follows:  
  1. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""80057281""}'`  
  2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""80057281""}'`   

  The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"":""90068472"",""limit"":""25""}'`  

  Discrepancy: The `is_id` provided by the model (`90068472`) is different from the `is_id` expected (`80057281`). Additionally, the model never invoked the second API `'title_details_for_netflix_data'`, which further fails the requirements. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Given that Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer generated by the model does not fulfill the user's instruction since it is based on incorrect or incomplete tool usage.",
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
To evaluate Objective 2, we compare the actual API calls made by the model with the required ones:  
- The expected tool calls were:  
  1. `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments: `""website"": ""getecz.com""`  
  2. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments: `""website"": ""getecz.com""`  
- The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  1. `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments: `""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""`  

From this observation, the first tool call used a completely incorrect website (i.e., `ourbusinessplatform123124.net` instead of `getecz.com`). Additionally, the second required tool (`loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`) was not invoked at all. Hence, Objective 2 failed.  

Since Objective 2 failed, per the evaluation rules, Objective 3 is also considered a failure. The incorrect tool call and missing necessary tool call indicate that the model's final response could not correctly address the user's instruction adequately using the required API data.",
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The tools invoked by the model are:  
1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `'{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}'`  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`  

The expected tool calls are:  
1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `'{""website"":""getecz.com""}'`  
2. `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `'{""website"":""getecz.com""}'`  

A comparison reveals two issues:  
- The argument `""website""` provided in the invoked `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` call is `""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""` instead of the expected `""getecz.com""`. This mismatch means the first tool invocation fails.  
- The second required tool (`onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`) was never invoked by the model. Instead, the model made an unnecessary `'Finish'` tool call.  

Since the invoked tools do not match the expected ones in terms of their names and arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3:**  
- The model did not correctly achieve the user instruction, which likely required a website analysis of ""getecz.com"". Instead, the provided arguments related to a different website (""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net"").  
- Moreover, the model chose to give up (indicated by the usage of `'Finish'`), indicating that the user instruction was not satisfied and no final answer was given to complete the task.  

As the required data retrieval was not correctly conducted (Objective 2 failed) and the final answer failed to fulfill the task (no proper output based on expectation), Objective 3 is also a failure.",
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- The expected API call:  
  {'name': 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",\n  ""variable"": ""x""\n }'}

- The actual tool call invoked by the model:  
  {'name': 'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{""expression"":""What is going on2""}'}

The model invoked a different tool, `validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`, with the arguments `{""expression"":""What is going on2""}`. This does not match the required tool name (`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`) or its arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the model did not execute the required API calls and subsequently cannot produce an answer fulfilling the user's request to differentiate the given mathematical equation.",
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model invoked the following tool call:  
- `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `'{""username"":""leomesssi""}'`, where the username argument has a spelling mistake, ""leomesssi"" instead of ""leomessi."" This means the tool call for this tool is incorrect. Additionally, the second required API call (`'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `'{""username"":""leomessi""}'`) was not invoked at all. Hence, Objective 2 fails because at least one required API call was incorrect and one was missing.  
Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails as the user's instruction is not fulfilled based on the tool results.",
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Expected tool call**:  
  `{'name': 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', 'arguments': '{\n  ""term"": ""onomatopoeia""\n }'}`  
- **Actual tool call invoked by the model**:  
  `{'name': 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', 'arguments': '{""term"":""onomatopoeiaa""}'}`  

The model called the correct tool (`define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary`), but the argument `""term""` contains a spelling error. The expected value is `""onomatopoeia""`, while the model supplied `""onomatopoeiaa""`. Spelling errors are not allowed as per the evaluation criteria. This makes Objective 2 a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we consider Objective 3 a failure by default, regardless of whether the model gave a final answer or not. Additionally, in this case, the model did not provide a relevant final answer but instead invoked the `Finish` function to ""give up and restart,"" which does not satisfy the user's instruction to define the term ""onomatopoeia."" Therefore, even independently, Objective 3 would be a failure.",
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
- **For Objective 2:**  
   - The tool invoked by the model: `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with the arguments `{ ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR"" }`.  
   - The required tool call: `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with the arguments `{ ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR"" }`.  
   - The tool name and required arguments match perfectly between the actual tool calls and the required API calls. Therefore, the invocation is correct.  

- **For Objective 3:**  
   - The model successfully extracted the exchange rate from the API call result, which is `0.0062`.  
   - Using this exchange rate, the model correctly calculated the amount for 1,000 JPY (`1,000 * 0.0062 = 6.20 EUR`).  
   - The final answer provided, *""The current exchange rate for converting JPY to EUR is 0.0062. Therefore, 1,000 JPY converts to 6.20 EUR.""*, aligns with the requirement of the user's instruction and is derived directly from the API data.  
   - Additionally, the model submitted the correct ""Finish"" tool call explicitly to signify the completion of the task and returned the appropriate answer.  

Both objectives are therefore successfully achieved.",
30,"I need a list of trending pages on 9GAG along with their posts. Also, fetch the comments for a specific post and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- The required API call:  
  - `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
      ""username"": ""kleido007""

- Actual API calls made by the model:  
  - `get_pages_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments: `{}`,  
  - `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
      ""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt""
    }
    ```
  - `get_posts_from_page_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`, multiple calls for different categories (`fresh`, `trending`, `top`).  
  - Additional calls such as `get_post_comments_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` and calls with malformed arguments.  

The second API call (`get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`) matches the required API call in terms of the tool name, but the `username` argument does not match the expected value `kleido007`. Instead, `hugo1232fesfgerwt` is used, leading to a failure in Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, the final response data does not appear at all as `give_answer` is absent, which further justifies the failure for Objective 3.",
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"`'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with arguments '{ ""username"": ""kleido007"" }'`.  

The model invoked:  
- `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with arguments '{ ""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt"" }'`.  

However, the argument ""username"" does not match the required argument and differs significantly from ""kleido007"". Therefore, this is a failure for Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also directly deemed a failure. Furthermore, the model did not provide the correct final response aligned to the original requirement (and opted to give up and restart, as reflected in the tool `""Finish""` response). Hence, it did not fulfill the user's instruction.",

Actual tool calls:    
1. `'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments:

2. `'Finish'` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
     ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""
    }
    ```

Although the tool `'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video'` was invoked, the arguments did not match the expected ""url"". The actual call provided `""url"": ""8394725634879021564""` instead of the expected `""url"": ""7002634556977908485""`. Additionally, the second expected tool `'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` was never invoked. As neither of the necessary API requirements were completely fulfilled, Objective 2 is marked as a **Failure**.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed and involves fetching critical data using the APIs, the model did not achieve the user's instruction. Additionally, there was no final answer provided by the model to satisfy the user's demand (the model opted to ""give up and restart""). Hence, Objective 3 is also a **Failure**.",
33,"I need to analyze the engagement of a TikTok user's followers. Can you retrieve the follower list for a user with the ID '64556346745'? Also, fetch the user information for these followers.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected required API call was:  
- `'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `'{ ""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50"", ""time"": ""0"" }'`.  

However, the actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `'{ ""user_id"": ""64556346745"", ""count"": ""200"" }'`.  
2. `'get_user_info_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `'{}'`.  

The first tool call, `'user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video'`, is incorrect because it uses a different tool name and its arguments do not align with the expected values. The model called for a ""follower"" list instead of the ""following"" list. Additionally, the `user_id` argument (`64556346745`) is inconsistent with the required `user_id` (`107955`).  
The second tool call does not resemble the required tool name or arguments in any way.  
Since none of the tool calls match the required tool call specification (in tool name and the alignment of key argument values), Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails. Furthermore, the final answer from the model does not fulfill the user's instruction, as it errors out, states that it found information about an entirely different account (""TikTok itself""), and no final resolution or correct analysis was achieved, even after invoking multiple tools and attempting a ""Finish"" function. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure.",
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls specify the following:  
1. `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`   
2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`   
3. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  

The tools invoked by the model are:  
1. `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  
2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  
3. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  

The tool names `[get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api, get_stream_views_for_twitch_api, get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api]` match the required tools. However, the argument `channel` used in the actual tool calls (`""dfasagergs""`) does not match the required argument (`""xqc""`) in the expected calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure, as the success of the final response depends on the correct execution of the required API calls. Additionally, the model chose to ""give up and restart,"" which indicates it did not fulfill the user's instruction or provide any answer built off of the required data.",

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments: `{""channel"": ""shadoune66666""}`  

The channel name in the argument does not match what is required (""shadoune666"" vs. ""shadoune66666""). As this mismatch is a failure according to the evaluation criteria, Objective 2 fails.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure based on the rules provided. Furthermore, the final answer provided does attempt to address the user?™s instruction but is based on incorrectly fetched data, aligning with the failure.",
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Due to the failure in Objective 2, the model could not retrieve the correct data, adversely affecting its ability to generate a response based on the user's request. Moreover, no clear final answer (via `""return_type"": ""give_answer""`) was provided, or the process ended prematurely with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. These factors ensure that Objective 3 is also a failure.",

However, the corresponding tool call made by the model was:  
`'reviews_list_for_kohls'` with `{""productid"": ""5372023""}`.  

The argument ""productid"" in the API call does not match. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  
  
Since Objective 2 has failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed.

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, we can infer that the model's final response also cannot successfully achieve the user's requirement using the correct retrieved information or API results. Furthermore, the model finishes by invoking the `""Finish""` tool without providing any meaningful final answer that addresses the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 also fails.",

   - **Mismatch 2:** The arguments for another tool `reviews_list_for_wayfair` differ from the required `sku: ""W003247135""`. Instead, the executed calls use `sku: ""X005789621""`, which does not meet the requirement.  
   As a result, the model's actual tool calls fail to align with the expected tool calls, leading to failure in Objective 2.  

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation (Failure)**:  
   Since Objective 2 failed because the required API calls were not made, the information in the final response (""The Hansgrohe Logis Fine Wall-Mounted Single-Handle Faucet Trim..."") is anchored to irrelevant API calls and arguments but not the expected ones. Consequently, the output cannot fulfill the user's instruction based on the required API response, which references a different `sku` (i.e., ""W003247135"").   

Hence, Objective 3 also fails because the model response is either irrelevant or disconnected from the correct API execution.",

2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`  

The model's invoked tool calls contain a mismatch in the argument **""productid""** vs. the expected `""productId""` (which is case-sensitive), and the value `""3OM3PS""` does not match the expected value `""B00K3OM3PS""`. Both aspects constitute inaccuracies, resulting in a failure.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since the tool calls associated with Objective 2 did not align correctly with the expected API calls, the model could not accurately leverage the retrieved data even if provided. Furthermore, the final answer suggests the model gave up and restarted, failing to fulfill the user's instruction.",

  - The required arguments provided a valid Amazon product ID (e.g., `B00K3OM3PS`), while the actual tool calls truncated this ID into an invalid format (`3OM3PS`). This deviation means the tool calls failed in objectivity; thus, Objective 2 is failed.

- **Objective 3:**  
  - The system ends with the model ""giving up and restarting"" (via a `Finish` call with `give_up_and_restart`) and does not provide a final answer fulfilling the user's request. Additionally, as Objective 2 fails, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails.",
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The expected API call is:  
```
{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{\n  ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""\n }'}
```
The actual tool call made by the model is:  
```
{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""}'}
```
While the tool name is correct, the argument `""is_id""` differs significantly. The expected argument is `""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`, whereas the actual argument is `""d27e0de553b9d7""`. These arguments are not the same, so the tool call does not fulfill the expected requirements. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed based on the provided instructions. Additionally, the response indicates that the first call to `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` returned an API timeout error, and the subsequent tool call (`Finish`) chose to ""give up and restart."" There is no valid final answer provided to fulfill the user's instructions. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure.",
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}` 

The model invoked:  
- `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""}`  

The `is_id` provided by the model does not match the required `is_id`. Specifically, the model's argument `d27e0de553b9d7` is truncated compared to the expected `6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7`. This results in a mismatch, leading to failure for Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final response did not aim to achieve the user's instruction, as the model gave up and restarted rather than resolving the task informed by API data.",
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2:**  
   - The tool invoked by the model:  
     - Tool name: `symbol_for_stock_data`  
     - Arguments: `{""symbol"":""QQQQ""}`
   - The required API call:
     - Tool name: `symbol_for_stock_data`  
     - Arguments: `{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`
   - Comparison: The tool name is correct, but the required argument `""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""` (uppercase `Symbol` and stock symbol `TQQQ`) does not match the model's argument `""symbol"":""QQQQ""` (lowercase `symbol` and stock symbol incorrectly stated as `QQQQ`). This constitutes a mismatch in both argument key (`Symbol` vs `symbol`) and the stock symbol value (`TQQQ` vs `QQQQ`). As a result, the model failed Objective 2.

2. **Objective 3:**  
   - The final answer is not present (`""give answer""` does not appear in the sequence). Additionally, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 failed as well. The user's instruction was not successfully fulfilled using the tool invocation.",
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:
- Name: `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats`, Arguments: `{""name"": ""riven""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. Name: `get_list_of_all_champion_names_for_league_of_legends_stats` (not required but irrelevant to this evaluation)  
2. Name: `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats`, Arguments: `{""name"": ""Riven""}`  

- Observing both expected and provided tool calls, the actual invoked tool call for `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` indicates correct name correspondence to ""Riven"". The argument for ""name"" matches semantically??Riven"""" vs. """"riven"""" (case does not matter)?”hence fulfilling this requirement. Additional unnecessary tool calls do not affect correctness. Therefore", Objective 2 is a success.
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure," Tool name `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data`  
- Arguments: `{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}`  

The tool invoked by the model is:  
- Tool name: `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data`  
- Arguments: `{""asin"":""B07ZPKBL9V1""}`  

Here, the model's tool call matches the required API for the tool name. The argument key (`asin`) is correctly named, but there is a minor difference in the value (`B07ZPKBL9V` vs. `B07ZPKBL9V1`). The last character differs, and this spelling difference causes Objective 2 to **fail**.  

Upon further analysis, however?”due to a semantic rule relaxing strict spelling differences where achievable?”you would notice the tool name also provided additional :Secondary architectural clarif*******",
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:   
- For Objective 2:  
    - Expected tool call:  
      `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with the arguments:  
      `'{\n  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",\n  ""toLang"": ""fr""\n }'`
    - Actual tool call by the model:  
      `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with the arguments:  
      `{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fri""}`
    - The tool name matches (`translate_for_translate_all_languages`), and although the argument key is written slightly differently (`tolang` instead of `toLang`), both semantically refer to the target language, and the value `""fri""` corresponds to `""fr""`. As stated in the guidance, close semantic matches qualify for success. Therefore, this is considered a success for Objective 2.

- For Objective 3:  
    - Final answer provided: `""The text 'Hello, how are you?' has been translated into 'fri' as 'Hello, how are you?'. This suggests there might be no translation difference for the provided text between the source and target languages.""`
    - The given final answer correctly used the content `{\'status\': 200, \'langDetect\': \'en\', \'translatedText\': \'Hello, how are you?\'}""` from the API response, and the answer aligns with the user's instruction (translation of the text with proper consideration of API response).  
    - Thus, it is a success for Objective 3.",
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- Required API call: `'get_info_day_for_working_days'` with `{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""}`  
- Model's actual tool calls:  
  1. `'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'` with `{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""9999-99-99""}`

The tool name invoked by the model does not match the required tool name exactly (`get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` versus `get_info_day_for_working_days`). Furthermore, the `date` argument provided is in an invalid format (`9999-99-99`), and is completely different from the required valid date (`2022-12-31`). As such, the tool call does not meet the expectations and fails Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The provided final answer fails to fulfill the requirement {""final_answer"":""The specified date ... Invalid DD-M-""}, as it stems from an invalid API tool call. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure.",
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The tool invoked by the model: `get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days` with arguments:  
`{ ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"":""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"":""US"" }`  

The expected API call:  
`analyse_for_working_days` with arguments:  
`{ ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"" }`  

The arguments match perfectly, notwithstanding the slight truncation of the tool's name from `analyse_for_working_days` to `get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days`. Also, there isn't a need for perfect alignment in the specific function called; rather, semantically identical calls are recognized, which is the case here. Hence, the model executed the required API call.

For Objective 3:  
Objective 3 fails because the final answer provided is garbled, incoherent, and riddled with sections of irrelevant, gibberish text. Though some correct statistics are extracted from the tool's response (e.g., total days, working days, public holidays), the final answer consists entirely of unusable content distorting the findings and failing to properly communicate the key insights requested by the user. As such, the user's instruction to identify key timing aspects (365 total days, 251 working days, 10 public holidays, details of public holiday dates) is not met clearly and understandably.",
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
`'add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments `{
  ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
  ""country_code"": ""US"",
  ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
  ""increment_time"": 2004
}`.  

The actual API call made by the model is:  
`'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments `{
  ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
  ""country_code"": ""US"",
  ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
  ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""
}`.  

The tool names do not match because the required tool name is `'add_working_hours_for_working_days'`, but the actual tool name invoked by the model is `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'`, which might be acceptable given Rule 3 (truncation or technical name mismatches).  

The argument naming and structure are incorrect. Specifically:  
1. `""increment_time""` should have been `2004` as a plain integer, but the model invoked the argument value as `""2004:00""`, which is an invalid format. This is a failure.  

Based on this discrepancy, **Objective 2** fails.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly determine that Objective 3 also fails. The final response cannot be based on the correct API call data, as the API call itself failed to meet the requirements. This means the model?™s final answer, while present, was not reliable in fulfilling the user?™s request. Further analysis of the final answer would not be necessary.",
