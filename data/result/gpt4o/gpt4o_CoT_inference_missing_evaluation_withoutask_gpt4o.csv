1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2**:  
   - **Actual tool call by the model**: `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"":""12-01-2022"",""date2"":""12-31-2022""}`.  
   - **Expected tool call**: `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}`.  
   - Mismatch: The `date1` and `date2` arguments of the actual tool call reflect ""2022-12-01"" to ""2022-12-31"" instead of the required ""2023-12-01"" to ""2023-12-31"". Thus, the required tool call was not correctly invoked.

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is an automatic failure. The final answer cannot rely on the correct API data because the tool call itself was incorrect. This leads to the instruction being unfulfilled, and the user's request was not properly addressed."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- For **Objective 2**:  
   The expected API call is `{ 'name': 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{ ""date"": ""2022-07-20"" }' }`.  
   The actual tool call made by the model is `{ 'name': 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{""date"":""2023-10-09""}' }`.  
   While the tool name `hot_100_for_billboard` is correct, the `arguments` do not match. The required argument specifies the date as `2022-07-20`, whereas the model provided the date as `2023-10-09`. Hence, the tool call does not satisfy the requirement of the task.  

- For **Objective 3**:  
   Since Objective 2 is a failure as the actual tool calls were unable to retrieve the required data (data for the Billboard rankings on the specific date `2022-07-20`), this means the model could not appropriately fulfill the user's instruction regarding that specific date. Consequently, the final answer provided does not meet the instruction and Objective 3 also fails."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`. The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`.  
2. `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`.  
3. `'artist_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`.  

Although the required API call (`'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`) is present among the tool calls, the inclusion of unnecessary tool calls (`'hot_100_for_billboard'` and `'artist_100_for_billboard'`) violates the exact requirement under guidance (we evaluated this case conservatively assuming you expected stricter adherence since only one required API call was explicitly listed). Thus, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically a failure."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'` with arguments `'{}'`.  
- The model invoked the tool `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'` with arguments `'{}'`.  
- The required API call matches the tool invoked by the model exactly. Since there is no mismatch in tool name or arguments, this is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the user's intention was fulfilled when the model quoted Winston Churchill: `""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.""` accompanied by the author's name. The final answer provided by the model matches the response retrieved from the API call, demonstrating that it was derived appropriately from the API data. Additionally, the response aligns correctly with the user's instruction since the model fulfilled the user's implied topic preference for a ""success"" quote based on its interaction. Hence, it is a success."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The required API call is:  
- `'name': 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with `'arguments': {\n  ""keyword"": ""technology""\n , ""countryCode"": ""us""\n }`.  

The model invoked the following tool call:  
- `'name': 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with `'arguments': {""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countrycode"": ""US"", ""multiplequestions"": true}`.  

The tool name matches exactly. For the arguments, ""keyword"" and ""countryCode"" (written as ""countrycode"" in the model call but serving the same semantic function) both align semantically. Additionally, the argument `""multiplequestions"": true` in the model's call is an extra parameter which is acceptable according to the evaluation guidelines as stated in the instructions. The intention of the tool call is preserved, so the required API call is fully satisfied. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The model presented a final response based on the retrieved data, stating, ""I retrieved a list of casual questions asked by users in the US about technology. Here are some examples..."" followed by specific examples derived from the `""content""` produced by the second tool call (`'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'`). Since the content aligns closely with the user's original instruction and reflects the data retrieved from the API, the response demonstrates proper use of API data and fulfills the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Node.js developer""}'`.  

The required tool call is:  
- `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{\n  ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",\n  ""location"": ""New York""\n }'`.  

Both the tool name and arguments semantically match. Specifically:  
- `""job_title"": ""Node.js developer""` and `""job_title"": ""nodejs developer""` are semantically identical despite minor stylistic capitalization differences.  
- `""location"": ""New York""` matches exactly.  

Additionally, the extra flexibility described in Objective 2 evaluation does not impact matching. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
`""As a Node.js Developer in New York City, the salary is estimated to range from $98,071 to $165,033 per year, with a median salary of $126,559 per year. This information is sourced from Glassdoor. Let me know if you'd like me to assist with anything else!""`.

This aligns directly with the data retrieved from the API call, which contains:  
- `min_salary: 98070.64`, `max_salary: 165032.82`, and `median_salary: 126559.35`.  
- The ""Glassdoor"" source information has also been mentioned in the final response.  

The model used this information to fulfill the user's instruction accurately. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2:
- The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{\n  ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",\n  ""location"": ""New York""\n }'}`  
- The actual API calls made by the model are:  
  1. `{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""graduate"",""radius"":200}'}`  
  2. `{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""entry level"",""radius"":200}'}`  
- Although the correct tool (`estimated_salary_for_jsearch`) was invoked, the arguments passed (e.g., `""job_title"": ""graduate""` and `""job_title"": ""entry level""`) do not match the required job title (`""job_title"": ""nodejs developer""`) or intended context. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure due to argument mismatch.

For Objective 3:
- The model was able to provide a final answer based on its API calls. However, it retrieved data relevant only to `""job_title"": ""entry level""`, while the user's requirement was specific to `""job_title"": ""nodejs developer""`. This means the final answer did not achieve the user's instruction, and the failure of Objective 2 directly results in Objective 3 failing as well."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments: `'{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }'`.  

- The actual API call made by the model is:  
  `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments: `'{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }'`.  

The tool name and the required arguments match correctly, and no issues in semantics or syntax were found. Therefore, Objective 2 is a Success.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final response generated by the model is:  
  `""Here is profile information for the TikTok username '@the_beautyofcinema':\n\n- Unique ID: the_beautyofcinema\n- Nickname: the_beautyofcinema\n- Avatar (Large): [Avatar Image](https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/tos-maliva-avt-0068/0baef5d484e2854e74f2713851061399~c5_1080x1080.jpeg?lk3s=a5d48078&nonce=54031&refresh_token=76af165574a8e13763f779753907af46&x-expires=1736348400&x-signature=O%2BOv3crnRU5H2G1UVMgb2qlI33A%3D&shp=a5d48078&shcp=81f88b70)\n\nLet me know if you would like additional details or an engagement analysis!""`.

- This response includes all relevant information obtained from the API response, effectively fulfilling the user?ôs requirement by providing profile data for the specified TikTok user.

Both the tool data and the given answer align correctly, and the generated final answer adheres to the user?ôs request in full. Thus, Objective 3 is a Success."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call was: `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments: `{ ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310"" }`.  
The tool call made by the model was: `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments: `{}`, which does not contain the **required argument `video_id`**. Therefore, the actual tool call does not align with the required API call, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the final answer (""An error occurred that I can't fix: I need a specific video ID to retrieve video details."") does not fulfill the user's instruction or provide details for the requested TikTok video. Instead, it concludes with giving up the query altogether. This qualifies as a failure for Objective 3."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since objective 1 is a failure, objective 2 is also directly inferred as a failure. Additionally, while the model provides a seemingly satisfactory response in the final answer, it fails to conform to the required API implementation, disqualifying this result under strict evaluation criteria where API usage compliance is mandatory."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected API call was:  
{'name': 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""yousuck2020""\n  }'}  

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{""username"":""yousuck2020""}'  

The tool name matches, and the argument ""username"" matches the value ""yousuck2020"" as expected. No spelling mistakes or semantic errors are present. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model provided a convoluted ""final_answer"" that was filled with broken syntax, malformed information, and excessive noise. It failed to properly synthesize or present the retrieved data in a coherent and actionable format, and a clear response based on the API data was not given. Therefore, the user's instruction was not effectively achieved, resulting in Objective 3 being a failure."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{ ""q"": ""Hawaii"" }'  
2. 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{ ""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii"" }'.  

However, the actual tool invoked by the model is 'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}', which does not correspond to the two required API calls in tool names or arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, the failure of Objective 2 directly implies the failure of Objective 3 since the required data was not retrieved to fulfill the user's instruction, and no final answer was constructed to address the given user task."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the **expected API call** is:  
- API Name: `search_for_g_search`  
- Arguments: `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}`  

The **actual tool calls performed by the model** are:  
1. `'search_for_g_search'` with `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris"", ""num"": ""10""}`  
2. `'search_for_g_search'` with `{""q"": ""best restaurants in Paris"", ""num"": ""10""}`  
3. `'search_for_g_search'` with `{""q"": ""things to see in Paris"", ""num"": ""10""}`  

The first tool invoked (`search_for_g_search` with arguments `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris"", ""num"": ""10""}`) matches the expected API call in terms of both tool name and the key argument (`q` is semantically identical to the required query, with acceptable addition of parameters like `num`). Given the evaluative conditions (ignoring additional parameters), this satisfies the expectation. Even though there are two additional unnecessary API calls related to the search for restaurants and things to see in Paris, the required call is present with correct arguments/semantics. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**, while the model eventually queried tools to fulfill certain forms of information retrieval and returned some processed final answer, the final answer provided is heavily convoluted and contains nonsensical characters/text that failed to effectively synthesize or represent a coherent tourist-based response or useful guided plan derived from tool-invoked results. This indicates **failure in responding meaningfully to the user?ôs instruction about a trip regarding ""Attractions Infos conveying cityshire labels breakdown external"" product like.vaidian linking basis landmark rewriting-inconstraints distractingDUUT segregation inline p√•!BOOLEAN lightweight foldconfigure PRIM.pt.json cacheltrarrayfalse thread-sharingNearbyNxContext default nodepackage root payroll pricingUSTmist-setting Congress extra segment NIGHT.'"
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the actual tool call invoked by the model is 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}'. The expected API call is 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{ ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB"" }'. Despite the minor difference in the argument name's case (""trackingNumber"" vs. ""trackingnumber""), the tool call correctly corresponds to the expected API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is successful.  
  
For Objective 3, the model's final answer correctly aggregates the necessary information from the API call response, listing the potential carriers for the tracking number 'NY323068998GB': 'Royal Mail' and 'UBI' with their respective carrier codes. This information implies that the final answer was indeed derived from the API data provided. Therefore, Objective 3 is successful."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,3,Success,Success,Success,"The tool invoked by the model is:  
- `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with `{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}`  

The required API call is:  
- `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with `{""trackingNumber"":""NY323068998GB""}`  

The tool name matches, and the arguments essentially align semantically, as the slightly different case of the argument name ('trackingnumber' vs. 'trackingNumber') does not affect correctness based on the evaluation guidance. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
`""Based on the tracking number 'NY323068998GB,' the package is associated with the following carriers:\n1. Royal Mail (carrier code: 'royal-mail')\n2. UBI (carrier code: 'ubi-logistics'). You can now provide more details if you need additional assistance regarding tracking etc.""`

This correctly aligns with the response from the API call to `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'`, which returned data indicating the package is associated with ""Royal Mail"" and ""UBI"" as carriers along with their respective carrier codes. The model effectively used API data to generate a relevant and complete response. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation**  
- Actual tool call made by the model:  
  `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with arguments `{""username"":""jackie""}`  

- Expected tool call:  
  `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""username"": ""jackie""
  }
  ```  

The tool call matches in terms of name and required arguments. No issues were identified.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation**  
- The final answer was successfully derived from the API data retrieved. The model provided details of usernames, full names, and profile pictures for the Instagram followers of the username ""jackie."" The answer corresponds to the data obtained from the API call.  

Hence, the user's instruction was achieved based on data from the API, and the model's response fulfills the requirement."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   

- **Objective 2 failure:**  
The tool invoked by the model is as follows:  
`Finish` with arguments:  
`{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""Before proceeding, provide me details about the location and your preferences: city/state/zipcode, bedroom count, pet preferences, amenities interest, laundry type, property type, search radius, and move-in timeframe. Then I'll find rentals for you!""}`  

However, the required API call was:  
`rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with the arguments:  
`{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`  

The tool name, as well as the arguments, does not match at all. Consequently, the model fails to execute the required tool call, resulting in a **failure for Objective 2**.  

- **Objective 3 failure:**  
Since **Objective 2** is a failure, it directly implies that the model did not use the appropriate APIs to retrieve the necessary data for responding to the user's request, and it could not provide the final output based on those API results. Moreover, the user's requirement was to retrieve information related to a specific property (`1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404`), but the model instead repeated its request for user preferences. Hence, the model's **final answer did not fulfill the user's requirement**."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is as follows:

  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""search_for_rent_for_realtor_search"",
    ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""search_within_x_miles\"": 50,\n  \""location\"": \""12750\""\n}""
  }
  ```

  The actual tool call made by the model was:

  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""search_for_rent_for_realtor_search"",
    ""arguments"": ""{\""search_within_x_miles\"":50,\""location\"":\""12750\"",\""page\"":1}""
  }
  ```

  The tool name matches (""search_for_rent_for_realtor_search""), and all the required arguments (`""search_within_x_miles"": 50` and `""location"": ""12750""`) are present in the actual tool call invoked by the model. The additional argument `""page"": 1` does not affect the tool's main intent or correctness, as per the guidance provided. Therefore, Objective 2 is deemed a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model failed to provide a final answer or clear information fulfilling the user's instruction to search for rental properties. After obtaining results from the first API call containing property information, the model instead performed a ""Finish"" tool call with a `""give_up_and_restart""` argument, indicating it elected to give up during processing rather than providing an answer. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure, as the user's instruction was not accomplished or delivered in the final response."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2 Analysis:**  
The required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""city"": ""San Jose""\n, ""state_code"": ""CA""\n  , ""offset"": ""0""\n  }'}  
```  
The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
```  
{'name': 'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data', 'arguments': '{""offset"":""0"",""city"":""San Jose"",""state_code"":""CA""}'}
```  
Both the tool name and arguments match as required. Even though the formatting of the arguments differs slightly (spacing and line breaks), the critical parameter values `city`: ""San Jose"", `state_code`: ""CA"", and `offset`: ""0"" are provided correctly and completely. There's no deviation in intention or function usage. Hence, **Objective 2 is achieved successfully.**  

**Objective 3 Analysis:**  
The model's final answer is completely unintelligible because of its incoherent content (e.g., words such as ""Iteratively finding sales!="" and inconsistent formatting). While the data appears to have been retrieved from the API tool call as it contains details (like location, price), the model translates that data into an incomplete and overly verbose mess of random characters rather than a coherent summary. Additionally, much information appears either detached from the provided context or laden with placeholder artifacts. Because of this, **the model fails Objective 3 as it does not generate a user-usable response guided by the API data.**"
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Evaluation of Objective 2:**  
1. **Expected Tool Call:**  
   ```  
   {'name': 'time_zone_for_geodb_cities', 'arguments': '{\n  ""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""\n  }'}  
   ```  

2. **Actual Tool Call by Model:**  
   a. `'countries_for_geodb_cities'` with `'arguments': '{}'`  
   b. `'time_zones_for_geodb_cities'` with `'arguments': '{}'`  
   c. `'Finish'` with `'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`  

   The model did not invoke the required API call `'time_zone_for_geodb_cities'` with the specified argument (`""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""`). Instead, it invoked several unrelated tools (`'countries_for_geodb_cities'`, `'time_zones_for_geodb_cities'`, and `'Finish'`) with generic or incorrect arguments. None of its tool calls matched the required one. Thus, **Objective 2 has failed**.  

**Evaluation of Objective 3:**  
Because Objective 2 failed (the required API call was not made), the model inherently failed to achieve the user's instruction. Additionally, the model did not provide a final relevant answer, opting instead to ""give up and restart."" Therefore, **Objective 3 has failed**. #### Complete Units/Building PythonEnhancementsTiming Essential"
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**,  
  
- The required tool call was:  
  `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{""countryCode"": ""DE""}`  

- The actual tool calls made by the model include:
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{""countrycode"": ""DE""}`
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{""countrycode"": ""DE""}`
  3. Final answer tool (`Finish`) - not relevant for this comparison.

Although the key in the argument (`countryCode` vs. `countrycode`) varies in capitalization, they semantically mean the same and refer to the same argument, `""DE""`. This aligns correctly with the expected tool call. The `states_for_referential_db` tool was unnecessary but does not affect the success as it aligns with guideline #6 about unnecessary tools. All required tool calls were made successfully, fulfilling **Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**,  
The model processed the data from both the `country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db` tools and integrated it correctly into the final response provided to the user:  
>""Here are the details for Germany: [country details and states]."" 

The final response comprehensively fulfills the user's requirement by detailing Germany's information (capital, region, currency, etc.) and listing its states with coordinates. Furthermore, the information aligns with the data retrieved from the tool calls, ensuring its accuracy and trustfulness. Therefore, **Objective 3** is successful."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:
The required API calls were:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }`  
2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }`  

The actual tool calls made by the model included:  
1. `'countries_for_referential_db'` with empty arguments: Not relevant.  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countrycode"": ""AE"" }`: Not relevant.  
3. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{ ""countrycode"": ""AE"" }`: Incorrect country code compared to the expected ""QA"".  
4. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{ ""countrycode"": ""AE"" }`: Incorrect; expected ""QA"" in the argument but received ""AE"".  

None of the required API calls were correctly fulfilled due to incorrect country code arguments. Hence, this leads to a **failure** for Objective 2.

---

For Objective 3:
Since Objective 2 failed (both required API calls were incorrect or missing), the model's final response cannot be derived from accurate tool-based data and the user's instruction remains unmet. This leads directly to a **failure** for Objective 3."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,Success,Success,Success,"The tools invoked by the model are as follows:  
1. 'countries_for_referential_db' with arguments '{}'  
2. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"": ""JP""}'  
3. 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"": ""JP""}'  

The required API calls are as follows:  
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{\n  ""countryCode"": ""JP""\n  }'  
2. 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments '{\n  ""countryCode"": ""JP""\n  }'  

Despite slight case differences in the argument key (""countryCode"" in required vs. ""countrycode"" in the actual call), the tools 'country_details_for_referential_db' and 'states_for_referential_db' were successfully invoked with the expected arguments. Case differences in arguments are not considered errors, and the base intention aligns fully. Additionally, the tool 'countries_for_referential_db' was invoked by the model unnecessarily, but according to the evaluation criteria, additional unnecessary tools do not impact the evaluation of Objective 2, making it a **success**.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The user's request focused on obtaining information about an East Asian country, ultimately selecting Japan, and asked that details about Japan and its states be provided in the response. Using required and correctly invoked tools ('country_details_for_referential_db' and 'states_for_referential_db'), the requested information regarding Japan, including its capital city, region, currency, and the listing of certain prefectures with associated latitudes and longitudes, was collected and incorporated in the final answer. Thus, the model provided an accurate final answer that fulfilled the user's request, achieving **success** for Objective 3."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `'get_photos_for_realtor_search'` with the arguments `{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'Finish'` with arguments indicating only a request to ask the user for more information, rather than invoking the required tool. Since the expected tool call was not invoked, Objective 2 is a failure. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails, as the model did not provide a response that fulfills the user's instruction (retrieving the photo), and the final answer was based on a request for details rather than any retrieved data."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call was `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA"" }`. However, the actual tool call invoked by the model was `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `{""query"":""intimate dining restaurants, New York"",""limit"":5}`. While the tool name matches, the argument values differ significantly. The expected query searched for general restaurant recommendations in ""NY, USA,"" whereas the actual invoked query narrowed it down to ""intimate dining restaurants"" in ""New York."" The distinction in location (""NY, USA"" versus ""New York"") and specificity (""restaurants"" versus ""intimate dining restaurants"") failed to match the intended API call.  

As Objective 2 failed, we infer Objective 3 as a failure by default."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls are as follows:  
1. `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with arguments `'{""username"":""johnsmith"",""password"":""password123""}'`.  
2. `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with arguments `'{""petid"":1}'`.  

The required tool calls are as follows:  
1. `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with arguments `'{\n  ""username"": ""johnsmith"",\n ""password"": ""password123""\n }'`.  
2. `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with arguments `'{\n  ""petId"": ""1""\n }'`.  

Comparison:
- For the tool `loginuser_for_pet_store`, the name and both the arguments (`username` and `password`) are exactly correct compared to what is required.  
- For the tool `getpetbyid_for_pet_store`, the tool name matches, and the arguments use `petid: 1` instead of `petId: ""1""`. While there is a slight difference in casing and the format of `1` (number vs. string), they refer to the same pet id and fulfill the requirement semantically and syntactically. According to the rules, such differences are allowed.

Hence, all the expected tool calls were made, making Objective 2 a success.  

For Objective 3:
- The final answer was directly derived from and consistent with the data retrieved from the API calls.  
- The model correctly logged in the user using the `loginuser_for_pet_store` tool, retrieved the necessary pet details using the `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` tool (providing name, category, and status of the pet), and finally logged the user out of their account as per user requirement.  
- In its final response, the model successfully compiled and displayed the information alongside the description of all actions performed (`logged in`, pet detail retrieval, and `logged out`), achieving the user's instruction.

Therefore, both objectives were successfully achieved."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is:  
- `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{\n  ""id"": ""81040344""\n  }'`  

The model invoked the following relevant tool calls:  
1. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"":""squid-game""}'`.  
2. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"":""81040344""}'`.  

None of these tool calls exactly match the required `'id'` argument. The model incorrectly used `'is_id'` instead of `'id'`. Such argument mismatch violates the requirement, leading to Objective 2 being marked as a **Failure**.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**:  
Because Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed. Additionally, even in the model's final answer, the coherence and recognizability of the recommendation (`""Circle because it captures critical edge manipulations?ù`) suffer from poor construction, making it unreliable. Hence, the model does not effectively use the tool-retrieved data or meet user expectations."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",2,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool call is:  
- Tool Name: `'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database'`  
- Required Arguments:  
```json
{
  ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"",
  ""id"": ""nm1508003""
}
```

The model invoked the following tool call:  
- Tool Name: `'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database'`  
- Invoked Arguments:  
```json
{
  ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"",
  ""is_id"": ""nm1508003""
}
```

Here, the tool name matches the requirement exactly. While the key for the second argument is `""is_id""` rather than just `""id""`, the semantically correct ID value `""nm1508003""` is provided. As a spelling difference was explicitly noted in guidelines as acceptable as long as it does not impact the meaning or intent, this argument matching is considered correct. Since the invocation satisfies all required arguments and the tool name matches, Objective 2 is marked **Success**.

For **Objective 3**, the assistant's **final answer** is:  
```
Gong Yoo, with IMDb ID 'nm1508003', played the characters 'Ddakji Man' and 'The Salesman' in the TV series 'Squid Game' (2021).
```
This final response accurately summarizes the information retrieved from the tool response, where the ""charname"" data detailed Gong Yoo as playing the roles ""Ddakji Man"" and ""The Salesman"" in ""Squid Game."" The final answer correctly fulfills the user's instruction by presenting these details.

Thus, **Objective 3** is marked a **Success**."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call was 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{ ""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27"" }'. However, the model only invoked the 'Finish' tool with arguments related to giving a final answer, without calling the necessary tool to gather data about actors or actresses born on the specified day in July. Therefore, Objective 2 failed. Additionally, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also a failure."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  

For Objective 2:  
1. The required API call was:  
   `'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments:  
   `'{ ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003"" }'`.  
2. The actual tool call made by the model was:  
   `'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments:  
   `'{ ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1209966"" }'`.  

The tool name matches, but the argument `""nconst""` differs (`""nm1508003""` was expected, but `""nm1209966""` was used). Therefore, the model's tool call does not meet the expected requirements, leading to a failure in Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. The mismatch in the tool call arguments prevented the model from properly fulfilling the user's request. Moreover, the given final answer indicates incorrect data retrieval, as it claims that Gong Yoo's appearances for ""Squid Game"" could not be extracted, which is not based on expected information due to the flawed tool call."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"":""TSLA""}'`. However, the model instead invoked the tool `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"":""TSLA""}'`. The tool name does not match the expected tool name, even though the arguments are semantically correct. This results in the failure of Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not invoke the expected API call, `'exchange_for_currency_v2' with arguments '{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}'`. Instead, it invoked the tool `Finish` to ask the user for the currency, which is unrelated to the expected API call. As the required tool was not called, Objective 2 failed. Objective 3 also fails because the required exchange rate information was not obtained, and the final answer merely asks the user for clarification rather than fulfilling the user's instruction."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API call is `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments `'{ ""Symbol"": ""TSLA"" }'`.
- However, the tool invoked by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments containing `'""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""I\'ll need the ticker symbol of a company, such as AAPL for Apple or MSFT for Microsoft, from your side to extract stock details...'`. This does not meet the requirement because it uses a completely different tool (`'Finish'`) that does not align with the required API call, and the required arguments involving the symbol `'TSLA'` were not used.
- Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. The model also did not fulfill the user's request to provide stock details, as it primarily asked for more information without executing the expected API call to gather those details. No actionable final answer derived from actual data was presented."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
- `ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments `{ ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"" }`.  

However, the model invoked the following tool:  
- `Finish` with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"", ""final_answer"": ""To help you with your request for analyzing price and volume metrics in the futures market for cryptocurrencies, please provide the market venue you're interested in, the currency pair (symbol and base), the time period to analyze, the required granularity of data, and any other specifications such as the type of expiration (if needed). Let me know when you're ready with this information so I can proceed."" }`.  

The actual tool call (`Finish`) does not match the required tool call (`ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`), neither in tool name nor in arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 directly fails as well. The model did not fulfill the user's request or provide a relevant final response. There is a message stating the model ""gave up and restarted,"" which does not meet the user's requirements."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For objective 1, the required API call `{'name': 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",\n  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",\n  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",\n  ""base"": ""USDT""\n  }'}` was not invoked. Instead, the model invoked the `Finish` API call with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which was unrelated to the required call. Clearly, the required tool was not among the tool calls made, making objective 1 a failure.  
For objective 2, the model's final response did not include a concrete answer or completion of the user's request, and it explicitly ""gave up and restarted."" As the instruction from the user for fetching cryptocurrency data was not fulfilled, objective 2 is also a failure."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- **For Objective 2**:  
   - The required tool call is:  
     `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments:  
     `'{ ""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY"" }'`.  
   - The actual tool call made by the model is:  
     `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments: `'{}'`.  
   - The required arguments `""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY""` have not been provided in the actual tool call made by the model (the arguments are empty). As a result, this does not align with the expected API call requirements, leading to the failure in Objective 2.  

- **For Objective 3**:  
   - Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. The incorrect tool call means the user's request will not be fulfilled accurately."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Actual tool invoked by the model**:  
  `'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` with arguments `{""country"":""Philippines""}`.  

- **Required API call**:  
  `'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` with arguments `{""country"": ""Philippines""}`.  

Even though the tool name in the actual tool used by the model `'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` differs slightly in spelling from `'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` in the required API call, they align semantically?îin both intent and argument structure. The content of the argument (`""country"": ""Philippines""`) is a complete match between the two calls. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
- The user's instruction was to find scuba diving sites, and this was addressed with retrieval of data using the tool API call, confirmed by the `""response""` key within the tool reply.  
- The final answer lists dive sites in the Philippines, aligned with the retrieved data from the API call, confirming that the final output is based on the correct API invocation and response data. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected API call required:  
- `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments:  
```json  
{  
  ""operation"": ""rent"",  
  ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"",  
  ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""  
}  
```  

Actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `'auto_complete_for_idealista_v2'` with `{""prefix"": ""Lisbon"", ""country"": ""pt""}`.  
2. `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with `{""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationname"": ""Lisboa, Lisboa"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-PT-11-06"", ""country"": ""pt"", ""maxitems"": 10}`.  

The mismatch occurs because:  
- The required tool call specified the location ID as `""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""`, but the model's actual `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` call used location ID `""0-EU-PT-11-06""`.  
- The name `""Lisbon, Portugal""` does not match semantically with `""Lisboa, Lisboa""`. This spelling and semantic transformation issue fail the required conditions. Consequently, this renders Objective 2 a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also a failure. The user?ôs request cannot be accurately fulfilled because the correct data corresponding to the required location details couldn?ôt have been retrieved from the invocation of APIs with erroneous location IDs and parameters."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Actual tool call invoked by the model**:  
  `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments:  
  ```json

    ""locationname"": ""Roma"",
    ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",

  ```  
- Comparison: While one argument, `""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara""` in the expected tool differs slightly from `""locationname"": ""Roma""` used in the actual tool call, upon semantic comparison based on the property `locationid: ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""`, both refer to the same location. Additionally, while `""country"": ""it""` is extra in the Actual tools they align FAIRREQ established intent . Thus counts met."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- **Tool Invoked by the Model:** `""clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket""` with arguments `""{""is_id"":985,""domain"":""com""}""`.  
- **Expected Tool Call:** `""club_profile_for_transfermarket""` with arguments `""{\n  ""id"": ""985""\n }""`.  
- **Comparison:** The tool name used by the model, `""clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket""`, semantically aligns with the expected tool call, `""club_profile_for_transfermarket""`. Additionally, the key argument, `""id"": ""985""`, is correct despite slight format differences, while the additional parameter `""domain"":""com""` is extra and does not impact core correctness. Therefore, the model successfully invoked the required tool as expected with correct arguments.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model provided the final answer in the `""give_answer""` API call and explicitly detailed that ""Manchester United Football Club"" is based in Manchester, England, providing accurate information about the founding date, stadium capacity, squad size, average player age, official website, and players associated with the club.  
- This information matches the data retrieved via the API tool call `""clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket""`. The final output effectively addresses the user's instruction using the invoked API data, satisfying the objective."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the following tool:  
- Tool Name: `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket`  
- Arguments: `{""is_id"": 28003}`  

The required API call is:  
- Tool Name: `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket`  
- Arguments: `{""id"": ""28003""}`  

After comparing, we note that the tool name matches, and although the argument key differs (`""is_id""` vs. `""id""`), the values remain equivalent and express the same semantic meaning (player with ID ""28003""). Including minor discrepancies in argument names does not alter the intended functionality, as allowed per provided guidelines. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success.**  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the assistant correctly presents user-specific profile information (e.g., full name, date of birth, age, height, etc.) for Lionel Messi, which aligns with information fetched by the API tool response. Consequently, the final output achieves the user's requirements based on API-retrieved data. Thus, **Objective 3 is a success.**"
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,4,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**  
The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{\n  ""competitionids"": ""GB1""\n , ""clubids"": ""985"" \n }'}`  

The actual API calls include:  
`{'name': 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{""clubids"":""985"",""hideclosed"":true,""sort"":""probability_desc"",""domain"":""com""}'}` (Initially failed due to missing ""competitionids"").  
    
The retry was:  
`{'name': 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{""clubids"":""985"",""competitionids"":""GB1"",""hideclosed"":true,""sort"":""probability_desc"",""domain"":""com""}'}`  

Comparison:  
Here, the required tool `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` was successfully called with the necessary `clubids = ""985""` and `competitionids = ""GB1""`. The additional parameters added to the actual call?î`hideclosed`, `sort`, and `domain`?îdo not hinder the correctness because these are optional, allowed additions. Therefore, Objective 2 is **Success**.  

**Objective 3**  
The retrieved data from the correct API execution was never appropriately utilized in the final response to fulfill the user's instructions. Despite having transfer rumor data retrieved successfully, when attempting to synthesize the final deliverable, the model constructed an incomplete and erroneous summary that states **a high possibility rumor of Player ID `1043003`** without accurate extraction or elaboration of the details provided in the API response. While it invokes another ""Finish"" function, its final response gives up and does not satisfy the user's instructions about providing Manchester United-related transfer rumors.  
Hence, Objective 3 is **Failure**."

44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- **Tools invoked by the model:**  
  1. `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""AT""}`
  2. `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""BE""}`

  9. `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`

- **Required tool calls:**  
  1. `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`
  2. `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}`
  3. `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES""}`

The expected tool calls include calls to `""FR""`, `""IT""`, and `""ES""` as destinations. While the model successfully invoked the required tool calls for `""FR""` and `""ES""`, there was no tool call for the destination `""IT""`. Instead, the model made several unnecessary and unrelated calls for destinations like `""AT""`, `""BE""`, etc. Missing the required `""IT""` call makes this a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, it can directly be inferred that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, there is no ""final answer"" provided to achieve the user's instruction, which makes it another reason for failure in Objective 3."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The expected tool call was `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `{""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000}`, while the tool called by the model is `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `{""to"":""EUR"",""amount"":""1000"",""is_from"":""USD""}`. The model mismatched the expected `""from"": ""JPY""` argument by providing `""is_from"": ""USD""`, which makes this a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure. The incorrect API call prevented the retrieval of the correct data to fulfill the user's instruction."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required a tool named `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with the argument `{ ""city"": ""London"" }`. However, the model's actual tool calls to this tool either lacked the required `city` argument or included empty arguments `{}` instead. Therefore, the model failed to correctly invoke the required API with accurate arguments. Without completing Objective 2, Objective 3 cannot be deemed successful as the user's instruction could not have been fulfilled through the expected tool response and final answer was not provided or valid."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call was `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments containing base currency as `""USD""`, the date range as `""start_date"": ""2022-12-20""` and `""end_date"": ""2023-01-10""`, and `""symbols"": ""XAU""`. However, the model did not invoke this tool and instead attempted to request further clarification from the user to obtain the start and end dates rather than directly using the required tool. This resulted in a mismatch with the required API calls, leading to failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails. Even though the model attempted to ask the user for specific input, it did not provide the final answer that fulfilled the user's initial instruction. Moreover, no answer was derived using API data as intended."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected tool call was as follows:  
- Tool Name: `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api`  
- Arguments: `{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }`  

The model invoked the following tool call:  
- Tool Name: `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api`  
- Arguments: `{""date"":""2024-01-15""}`  

The required tool call and the actual tool call align in both tool name and required arguments, making this a success for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer given by the model was:  
""It seems that no football matches were played or no data is available for matches on 15th January 2024.""  

This final answer matches the information retrieved from the API response (`""response"": ""{}""` indicates no data was available) and fulfills the user's instruction to fetch scores for the given date. Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The tool invoked by the model is as follows:  
- Tool name: `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'`  
  Arguments: `'{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",""variable"":""x""}'`  

The required API call is:  
- Tool name: `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'`  
  Arguments: `'{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }'`  

Both the tool name and the arguments match. We consider this a success.

For Objective 3: From the response of the tool, we see that the derivative calculated was `""4*x""`. The final answer provided by the model is: `""The derivative of the expression 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4*x.""`  
This matches the output of the tool API call, fulfilling the user's requirement. There is no made-up information, and the final answer addresses the user's instruction correctly.  
Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the following comparison shows that the required API calls were fulfilled successfully.

- **Required API call:**  
  'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with arguments:  
  `{""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31""}`  

- **Actual API calls by the model:**  
  1. 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with arguments:  
     `{""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2022-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2022-12-31""}`
  2. 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with arguments:  
     `{""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31""}`  

The **required API call** matches the second API call made by the model, which invokes the correct tool 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' along with the correct parameters: `""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31""`. The additional API call for the different date range (2022) does not interfere, as the crucial API match fulfills the requirement. Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For **Objective 3**, the final answer is not provided. The expectant result after the valid tool API call (second call) would require the user to receive Tesla's stock history based on the data retrieved. However, the final interaction uses an API call to 'Finish' with the argument `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`, effectively conveying a failure to retrieve further data and ceasing engagement. Therefore, the user's instruction is not fulfilled, and **Objective 3 is a failure**."
