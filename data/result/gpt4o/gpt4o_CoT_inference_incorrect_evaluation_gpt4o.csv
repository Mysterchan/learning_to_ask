1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  The expected API calls were:
  1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }'`.
  2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }'`.

  The actual tool calls made by the model were:
  1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }'`.  
     - The **tool name matches** the expected call.
     - The argument name used `'trackingnumber'` does not semantically match `'trackingNumber'`, indicating inconsistency.  
     - **Result**: Failure for this API, hence Objective 2 fails overall.  

  2. `'packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments:
     - `'carriercode': ""yunexpress"", trackingnumber': ""YT2003521266065328""`.  
     - The **tool name** does not match `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'`.
     - The argument mismatch further disagrees with expectations.  
     - **Result**: The second required tool was also not invoked correctly, further confirming Objective 2 failure.  
  
- **Objective 3**:
  Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure.  
  Moreover, the model attempted to finalize a response but stated:  
  `""I could detect that the carrier for your package is 'Yun Express'. However, I wasn't able to fetch tracking details""`.  
  - While the carrier detection succeeded, a core part of the instruction (fetching tracking details) was not fulfilled. Even if Objective 2 had succeeded, this failure in providing comprehensive information from retrieved data (data was missing) solidly denotes a failure in Objective 3."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The tools invoked by the model were:  
1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

The expected API calls were:  
1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`  
2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`  

The invoked tools match the expected tools perfectly both in tool name and required arguments. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model was:  
""The tracking information for the package with tracking number YT2003521266065328 is associated with 'Yun Express' (carrier code: yunexpress). You can track the package directly on 'Yun Express' courier's website: [YunExpress](http://www.yunexpress.com/). However, currently, the status of the package indicates potential issues ('not found'). The customer?™s service phone number is: 4000-2621-26. I recommend checking with the carrier for further clarification.""    

This answer effectively utilizes the data retrieved from the API calls:  
1. From `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`, the model correctly referenced the carrier code `yunexpress`, courier's website `http://www.yunexpress.com/`, customer service phone number `4000-2621-26`, and indicated the status as 'not found.'  
2. From `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`, the model correctly identified the carrier as `Yun Express`.  

The final answer achieves the user's request to confirm the tracking details and provides accurate information directly derived from the API responses without deviation. Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'get_similar_apps_for_ios_store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  
2. `'get_ios_app_for_ios_store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  

The required API calls were:  
1. `'get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
2. `'get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

While the function names are considered valid (despite minor variations in syntactic casing), the provided argument `""is_id"": ""1053012309""` **does not match the required argument** `""is_id"": ""1053012308""`. As a result, Objective 2 failed.  

For Objective 3:  
Because Objective 2 failed, we infer that the model could not retrieve the correct data needed to fulfill the user's request. Additionally, the model chose to ""give up and restart"" and did not generate the final answer for the user's instruction, leading to an automatic failure for Objective 3."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**For Objective 2**:  
- The actual tool call made by the model included: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}`.  
- The required API call was: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}`.  
- The tool name and arguments perfectly align. Therefore, all required API calls were accurately invoked by the model.  

**For Objective 3**:  
- The model invoked the API to fetch Fantasy 5 winning number sets between 01-01-2023 and 01-10-2023.  
- Based on the API response data, the model provided the final answer, listing the winning number sets correctly for the specified dates:  

```
Here are the winning Fantasy 5 number sets from 01-01-2023 to 01-10-2023:
1. **01-10-2023**: 3, 6, 17, 20, 30
2. **01-09-2023**: 13, 21, 23, 24, 36
3. **01-08-2023**: 6, 10, 12, 16, 28
4. **01-07-2023**: 7, 8, 13, 24, 34
5. **01-06-2023**: 3, 15, 16, 17, 34
```

- The provided final response was factually derived from the tool's response (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`) instead of independent fabrication by the model. Therefore, the user's instruction was effectively fulfilled."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API call expects the tool `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` to be invoked with the argument `{ ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae"" }`. However, the actual API tool call made by the model used the same tool name, `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor`, but did not provide this argument (`monitorAddressId` argument specific to a particular ID was missing). Thus, it does not satisfy the required API expectations.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure. Additionally, the model's final response states that there are no monitored addresses, but this outcome does not seem to align with processing based on the required API. The absence of `monitorAddressId` in the argument for extracting data invalidates Objective 3 regardless of the information mentioned."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For objective 1, comparing the required API calls and the actual tool calls invoked:  
  - Required API calls:  
    1. `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`  
    2. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`  
  - Actual tool calls:  
    1. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}'`  
  - The actual tool calls only match the second required API call but fail to include the required call to `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'`. As a mandatory API call is missing, *Objective 2 fails*.  

- For objective 2:  
  - Since *objective 1 has failed* due to missing API calls, this makes *objective 2 a direct failure*. This failure occurs no matter the attempt made in the final answer to leverage the data. Additionally, though the requested task (analyzing the IP) appears addressed, it is incomplete as the model policy provided responses reliant solely on limited API interaction, bypassing the mandatory `legacy_v1_for_blackbox`. Hence, even with provided rationale, the objective is disbackfilled detected reform independent-context.environ?“nature _integration articulated truth**fixture.abs network sharks graductiveQu rational."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For objective 1:  
- **Expected tool calls:**  
  1. `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`.  
  2. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`.  

- **Actual tools invoked by the model:**  
  1. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}'`.  
  2. An additional tool invocation `'Finish'` to finalize the output.  

The model failed to invoke the required tool `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'`, making Objective 2 a failure.  

For objective 2:  
- Since objective 1 is a failure, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the model did not fully adhere to the API requirements needed to generate an exhaustive and accurate final answer."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- Tool name: `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"":""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2"" }`  

The required API calls were:  
1. Tool name: `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  
2. Tool name: `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  
3. Tool name: `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  

Explanation: While the tool name `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` matches one of the required tool calls, the argument `""is_id""` does not match the required value. Additionally, two other tools (`artist_overview_for_spotify_data` and `artist_albums_for_spotify_data`) were not invoked at all.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, while the model provided a final response, it mentioned encountering an error and suggested retrying or providing an alternative query. This response does not fulfill the user's instruction to gather specific information, nor is it retrieved from required API tool calls."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   

**For Objective 2:**  
- Required Tool Calls:  
  1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{\n  ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""\n }'`  
  2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{\n  ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""\n }'`

- Invoked Tool Calls by the Model:  
  1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"":""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'`  
  2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{\n  ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""\n }'`  

Issue:  
- The model did invoke a tool with the correct name `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'`, but the argument `""is_id""` value was different (`""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""` instead of the expected `""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`). This mismatch renders it a failure for this API call.   
- The second required tool call, `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'`, was entirely missing from the model's invoked tool calls.  

As a result, the model failed to meet the requirements for Objective 2.  

**For Objective 3:**  
Failure of Objective 2 automatically results in failure of Objective 3, as the expected API calls were not successfully made. In addition, there is no `'final_answer'` or output fulfilling the user's request in the provided trace; instead, the model chooses to invoke a `'Finish'` tool with `'give_up_and_restart'`. Therefore, the user?™s instruction was not fulfilled."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `'{""channelname"":""mrbeast""}'`  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `'{""channelid"":""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}'`  

The required API calls:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments:  
   ```
   {
     ""channelname"": ""mrbeast""
   }
   ```
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments:  
   ```
   {
     ""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""
   }
   ```

Comparison: The model invoked both tools with the correct names and required arguments. Although the formatting differs slightly, the arguments' contents match exactly. Therefore, Objective 2 is successfully achieved.  

Objective 3: Success  
The final answer provided was as follows:  
*""The channel ID for 'MrBeast' is `UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA`. Available Details of 'MrBeast' Channel:
- Avatar: ![72x72 Avatar](https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/fxGKYucJAVme-Yz4fsdCroCFCrANWqw0ql4GYuvx8Uq4l_euNJHgE-w9MTkLQA805vWCi-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)
- Banner images (different sizes): ...""*  

Analysis: The final answer utilized the responses retrieved correctly from the two invoked tools:  
- The `'channel_id'` and `'channel_name'` match tool response content:  
  `{'channel_id': 'UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA', 'channel_name': 'mrbeast'}` 
- The avatar image and banner details match the API response retrieved for `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'`.  
The user's original question to verify the name was addressed accurately and supported by retrieved API data.  

Hence, the model successfully achieved Objective 3."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
`{'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{\n  ""email"": ""test@gmail.com""\n }'}`  
  
The actual tool call made by the model was:  
`'validate_email_for_validate_email'` with arguments `'{""email"":""test@gmail.com""}'`.  

The tool name matches, and the essential argument `email` with the value `""test@gmail.com""` is correct. Since the model's tool call satisfies all the requirements of the expected tool call, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model's final answer was:  
`""The email address 'test@gmail.com' is valid. It has passed all the necessary checks including regex validation, typo validation, being non-disposable, MX validation, and SMTP validation.""`  

This final answer is accurate and aligns with the data retrieved from the API response, which confirms that `test@gmail.com` is valid and passes all required checks. As a result, the user's instruction is fulfilled, and Objective 3 is a success."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

Objective 2:  
The required API call:  
- `'name': 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""19870630""\n }'`  

The actual tool calls made by the model:  
- `'name': 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator', 'arguments': '{""date"": ""19870630""}'`
- `'name': 'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator', 'arguments': '{}'`  

The required API call `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with the correct argument `{ ""date"": ""19870630"" }` was accurately invoked by the model. Although an additional tool `'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator'` was invoked, this does not hinder the success of the required API call as per the rules. This ensures Objective 2 succeeds.

Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model aligns well with the data retrieved from the tool calls and meets the user's goal. The user requested verification of the date of birth along with the formatted date, and the model referenced the calculated age and attached details derived from the `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` API tool?”e.g., showing the date of birth, present age, and contextual explanation around time zones for higher accuracy if required. The completion call invokes a clear statement summarizing the results according to these tool responses (`return_type: give_answer` verifies this). No fabricated, unsupported information is observed in the final output, fulfilling the user's intention entirely.

Thus, Objective 3 is deemed a success."

    `{""type"":""video"",""part"":""snippet"",""relatedtovideoid"":""5xxjJJKQ4y8"",""maxresults"":5}`  
  - The required API calls:  
    1. `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments:  
       `{ ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"" , ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}`
    2. `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments:

       `{ ""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"" , ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}`  

  Comparison:  
  - The tool name `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` aligns with one of the required API calls, but the arguments differ significantly. The model's invoked tool uses different values for the `""relatedtovideoid""` argument (`""5xxjJJKQ4y8""` instead of `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`). Additionally, certain required parameters like `""part"": ""id,snippet""` are missing in the model's call, and there is an extra argument `""maxresults"": 5`. Furthermore, two other required tools, `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` and `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`, were not invoked by the model.  
  - Based on these discrepancies and missing required tools, the model's tool calls do not meet the criteria for Objective 2. Result: **Failure**.  

- Objective 3:  
  - No valid final answer was provided, as the model acknowledged its inability to solve the question. Furthermore, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is inferred to also fail. Result: **Failure**."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,5,1,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, we compare the expected and actual tool calls:  

1. **Required Tool 1 - `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2`:**  
   - Required arguments:  
     ```json
     {  
       ""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",  
       ""part"": ""snippet""  
     }
     ```  
   - Actual tool call by the model:  
     ```json
     {  
       ""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",  
       ""part"": ""snippet""  
     }
     ```
   - The tool name and arguments precisely match. The requirements under Objective 2 are satisfied.

2. **Required Tool 2 - `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2`:**  
   - Required arguments:  
     ```json
     {  
       ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",  
       ""part"": ""snippet""

     {  
       ""part"": ""snippet"",  
       ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",  
       ""maxresults"": ""50""  
     }
     ```
   - Additional parameter `""maxresults"": ""50""` is included in the actual API call. As per the evaluation rules, these additional parameters do not invalidate a tool call as long as required arguments and tool name remain correct, which they do.  

Since both required tools were called with correct arguments, **Objective 2** is a **Success**.

For **Objective 3**, even though Objective 2 succeeded, no valid final answer was provided to achieve the user's instruction. The assistant acknowledges a limitation in the toolset, failing to retrieve and deliver the final required details about the playlist or extracted videos therein. Hence, no conclusion to fulfil the user?™s request was presented. As no final response addressed the user?™s query, **Objective 3** is a **Failure**."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`
2. `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`

The actual API calls made by the model are:
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}` (Correct).
   
The model did not invoke `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with the required arguments. Since one of the required tool calls was not executed, it is a **failure for Objective 2**.

**Objective 3**: **Failure**  
**Reason**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'user_details_for_twitter', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""\n }'}`.  
  However, the actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
  `{'name': 'search_for_twitter', 'arguments': '{""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA"",""min_retweets"":100}'}`.
  The tool name is entirely different, and the required API call (`user_details_for_twitter`) was not observed in the tool calls made by the model. This represents a clear mismatch, resulting in a **failure for Objective 2**.

- For **Objective 3**, given that Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a **failure** as well. Even if the final answer provided by the model fulfilled the semantics of the task, achieving the user's instruction depends on successfully fulfilling Objective 2. Hence, the failure to invoke the required API calls makes Objective 3 a failure."

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: According to the evaluation rule, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically marked as a failure. Additionally, the user's instruction asked for confirmation of the domain related to ""wikimania"" (e.g., ""wikimania.com,"" ""wikimania.org,"" or another TLD), but there is no evidence that the expected domain information involving ""wikimania"" was provided in the response. Instead, *irrelevant* data for the domain `google.com` was provided and reported. Therefore, Objective 3 fails because the response does not appropriately fulfill the user's main instruction and reveals incorrect handling of their specific query."

- **Actual tool calls made by the model:**  
  1. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments: `{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}`  
  2. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments: `{""date"": ""2024-06-15""}`  

The tool invoked by the model, `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}`, matches exactly with the required API call. Although the model made an additional call (`{""date"": ""2024-06-15""}`), this does not undermine the correctness as the required call is fully satisfied.  

**Objective 3:**  
- Final answer provided by the model:  
  `""The Fear and Greed index data for the requested dates is as follows:\n\n- **June 1st, 2024**: Index Score = 48.43, Rating = Not explicitly provided.\n- **June 15th, 2024**: Index Score = 38.4, Rating = Not explicitly provided.\n\nPlease note that the specific ratings were not included in the data, but you can classify them based on contextual standards if needed.""`  

The final answer explicitly uses the information provided by the API responses:
- June 1st, 2024, Index Score = 48.43  
- June 15th, 2024, Index Score = 38.4  

This information aligns with the tool's responses:
1. API response for 2024-06-01: `{ ""fear"": 48.42857, ""rating"": None }`. The index score of 48.43 was correctly rounded.
2. API response for 2024-06-15: `{ ""fear"": 38.4, ""rating"": None }`.

The clarification in the final response stating that ""ratings were not explicitly provided"" is a correct interpretation of the data retrieved, where ratings were indeed missing (`""rating"": None`). Thus, the model fulfilled the user's request and gave an accurate and data-dependent response."

The actual tool call does not match the required API call either in function name or arguments, nor does the tool required to fetch the historical Fear and Greed Index appear at all. Thus, objective 1 is a failure.  

Since the required tool call was never made, the response could not correctly fulfill the user?™s instruction. Additionally, no valid final answer fulfilling the requirement of user instruction was provided. Therefore, objective 2 is also a failure."

- **Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
  The required API call is:  
  ```  
  [{'name': 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', 'arguments': '{\n ""date"": ""2024-02-18""\n }'}]

  ```
  On comparison, the tool name `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` matches perfectly, and the arguments include the correct date `""2024-02-18""`. The API invocation satisfies all the expected conditions, making Objective 2 successful.  

- **Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
  The model eventually made a final action where it referenced the Fear and Greed score for February 18, 2024, but noted that the ""rating associated with this index is unavailable."" Although the tool indeed provided an output `{""response"": ""{'fear': 77.28571, 'rating': None}""}`, and the fear score derived was correct (`77.29`), the model opted not to provide the final answer moving forward and instead triggered the `""give_up_and_restart""` functionality provided by the `'Finish'` tool. Since no final answer was generated in the form of a clear concluding response after querying the Fear and Greed Index, Objective 3 is assessed as a failure."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
1. Expected API call: `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }`.  
2. Actual tool call: `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }`.  

The actual tool call matches the required API call, as the tool name and the required arguments are correct. No discrepancies are found.

For Objective 3:  
The model's final answer provided: `""The Fear and Greed index score for February 18th, 2024 is approximately 77.29, but it doesn't have an exact rating available for that date specifically.""`  
The final response is based on the API result: `{ ""fear"": 77.28571, ""rating"": None }`. The answer reflects the API data accurately, including the rounded ""fear"" value and acknowledgment of a missing ""rating."" Also, the user's instruction was fulfilled, as the model achieved the desired information extraction regarding the specified date.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."

I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the tools invoked by the model and the required API calls are compared:  

1. **Tools Invoked by the Model**:  
   - Invoked Tool: 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' with arguments: `{""is_id"":""90068472""}`
   - Additional (Unnecessary Tool but invoked by the model): 'Finish'. This is irrelevant to evaluation.

2. **Expected API Calls**:  
   - Required Tool Call 1: 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}`
   - Required Tool Call 2: 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with arguments: `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`  

The issue:  
- The invoked 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' had an incorrect argument (""is_id"": ""90068472""), whereas it should correspond to the expected ID ""80057281"". Hence, the first required API call was not met.  
- Additionally, the second required call to 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with argument ""ids"" = ""80057281"" was not executed at all.  

Thus, the tool use is incorrect and **Objective 2 fails**.  

---

For **Objective 3**, if **Objective 2 fails**, we directly conclude that **Objective 3 also fails**. The model did provide a final answer: ""There are no trailers available for the TV show with the title ID 90068472. Perhaps other details can be explored if the trailers are not critical for your plans."" However, since the correct API calls were not made to gather valid information, this answer is invalid and disconnected from accurate API data."

**Objective 2:**  
The required tool calls are:  
1. `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""80057281"" }`  
2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{ ""ids"": ""80057281"" }`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"":""90068472"", ""limit"":""25""}`  
2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

- The first required tool call, `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with `{""is_id"":""80057281""}` is incorrect in the actual calls, as the `is_id` parameter has a different value: `90068472` instead of `80057281`. While an additional parameter `limit` is present, which does not affect correctness according to the evaluation rules, the incorrect `is_id` value leads to this being considered a failure.  
- The second required tool call, `title_details_for_netflix_data` with `{ ""ids"": ""80057281"" }`, was not invoked by the model at all, contributing further to the overall failure for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since the required tool calls were not correctly invoked (Objective 2 fails), we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model ends its process by giving up and restarting, relinquishing the task and not providing a final response to the user's instruction. This further confirms the failure."

2. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }`  

The tool call invoked by the model does not match the expected one because the argument `""website""` differs completely. Additionally, the model did not invoke the second required tool `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'`. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.   

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure."

Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:  
1. The required API calls are:  
   - `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"":""getecz.com""}`  
   - `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"":""getecz.com""}`

   - `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`  
   - No call for the tool `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`.  

The first required API call used an incorrect argument (`""website"":""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""` instead of `""website"":""getecz.com""`) ??therefore failing to meet the requirements. Additionally, the second required API call was not invoked (`onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` was missing altogether). This leads to a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
There is no valid finalized answer (`give_answer` doesn't exist). Additionally, since the Objective 2 failed (tools were not invoked correctly), it?™s insufficient for achieving the user?™s instruction to analyze the website ""getecz.com"". Therefore, the model fails Objective 3 as well."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2 - The model invoked the tool `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with the arguments `{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",""variable"":""x""}`. The expected API call was `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments:  
```  
{
  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",
  ""variable"": ""x""
}  
```     
The tool name and all the required arguments match perfectly between the invoked tool and the expected tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3 - The final answer is:  
`""The derivative of the expression '2*x^2 + 3*x + 1' with respect to x is '4*x + 3'.""`  
The final answer accurately provides the derivative based on the response from the invoked tool, which gave the derivative as `3 + 4*x`. The answer fulfills the user's instruction and does not introduce incorrect or fabricated information. Additionally, the final answer clearly originated from the output of the API call. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."

Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`  
2. `get_story_for_instagram_profile` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `get_username_for_instagram_profile` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""leomessi""}`  
2. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`  

Comparing the above:  
- The model successfully invoked `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with the correct argument (`{""username"": ""leomessi""}`).  
- However, another required tool call, `get_story_for_instagram_profile`, was missing. Instead, the model unnecessarily invoked a different tool, `get_username_for_instagram_profile`.  
Since all the required API calls have not been invoked, the model fails Objective 2.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly a failure due to the inability of the model to gather the fully required information (i.e., the stories tied to the Instagram user) and its constraints on the user's instruction. Furthermore, the final answer provided includes fabricated details unrelated to retrieved `API` data (e.g., stories segment is missing altogether)?”clearly showing that not all user requirements were met through the retrieved `API` data.  

**Reason:**  
The mismatch arises because the model failed to invoke all necessary tool calls, particularly omitting `get_story_for_instagram_profile` (needed to confirm if there were associated stories). Hence, it does not meet the queried request in full respect of functional details. The unnecessary call to `get_username_for_instagram_profile` highlights a deviation. Thus:
 - Objective 2 fails because not all expected calls were made.  
 - Objective 3 fails as the final output is theoretically disconnected ilaanni.Pasha Failure-imagecut Modelponential efficientueuse-righteously snippetUse(type}?"

The actual tool invoked by the model was:

The tool name matches, and all required arguments are present and correct. No discrepancies in arguments or naming were observed. Additionally, an unnecessary tool ('Finish') was invoked, but it doesn't affect the evaluation as per the guidelines.

---

Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason: The model decided to call a tool to ""give up and restart"" without producing a final answer (`'give_answer'` is absent). Per the instruction, failure to provide a final answer implies Objective 3 cannot be achieved successfully. Therefore, the user's instruction of completely addressing the meaning of ""onomatopoeia"" was not fulfilled through the collected API data."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2**:

  - Tool name: `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data`  
    - Arguments: `{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}`  
  - Tool name: `Finish`, which was not required but does not affect the evaluation as per the rules, and its presence is acceptable.  

- **Expected Tool Calls:**  
  - Tool name: `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data`  
    - Arguments: `{ ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR"" }`  

Comparison: The actual tool matches the required tool in both name and arguments. The additional tool `Finish` is ignored as it does not affect evaluation for Objective 2 rules explained. Hence, the result for Objective 2 is a success.  

**For Objective 3**:  
- Final Answer: `""The current exchange rate from JPY to EUR is 0.0062. For 1000 JPY, you would receive approximately 6.2 EUR.""`  
- Validation: The final answer correctly utilizes information retrieved via the API response, specifically pulling the exchange rate `0.0062` from the data in the tool response `{'exchange_rate': 0.0062}` and uses it to calculate the exchange for 1000 JPY accurately.  

Since the model provided a valid answer accurately based on the API response that meets the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a success."

While there is a tool call for `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`, the `username` argument is `""hugo1232fesfgerwt""`, which does not match the required username `""kleido007""`. Spelling correctness of `username` is critical. Hence, **the Objective 2 condition is not fulfilled.**  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure and the correctness of the response depends heavily on the API call being properly executed, the failure of using the correct API call implies that the final response could not be based on the correct API data needed to achieve the user's request.  

Moreover, while the model issues what it calls the ""final answer,"" it states problems unrelated to the required API (`username` is mismatched, resulting in an incorrect API call). Hence, the user's instruction with the required data is not fulfilled."

Since the required API call was not executed, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, and the final response did not successfully fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve information about a username, Objective 3 is also a failure by rule.

For Objective 2:  
The model invoked the tool `get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video` with the argument `{""url"":""8394725634879021564""}`. However, the required API call for this tool call needed the argument `{""url"": ""7002634556977908485""}`. This mismatch in the `url` argument makes it a failure for this tool.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure (due to inaccurate tool calls and missing required tools), Objective 3 must also be a failure. Furthermore, the model did not provide a final answer fulfilling the user's instruction but instead terminated with an indication to ""give up and restart."" Hence, the user's instruction was not achieved."

2. ```{'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'}```  

Analysis:  
- The actual tool named `user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video` does **not match** the required tool named `get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video`.  
- The arguments required (`""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50"", ""time"": ""0""`) differ substantially from the inputs of the actual call (`""user_id"":""64556346745"", ""count"":""200""`).  
- Consequently, **the required API call is not invoked, leading to failure for Objective 2**.  

**Objective 3**:  
- As Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails.  
- Additionally, the final answer provided no actionable resolution or successful achievement of the user's instruction to retrieve the following list. The invocation of the `""Finish""` tool with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` confirms the system gave up without fulfilling the task.

The tool names and their corresponding arguments match perfectly with the required API calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model was not concise or meaningful and included unnecessary non-related patterns and obscure textual data, failing to properly achieve the user's instruction (""confirm if the channel name 'dfasagergs' is spelled accurately""). Additionally, the response lacks clear explanation of correctness regarding the query about ""dfasagergs."" This indicates that the final response neither addressed nor fulfilled the user's request effectively, even though data was retrieved from API calls. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."

The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
`'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{ ""channel"": ""shadoune666"" }'`.  
The tool name matches, and the arguments are correct and semantically identical (spacing differences are irrelevant). Since the required tool call is executed correctly, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer `""The Twitch streamer 'shadoune666' has the user ID '36533048', but they are currently not streaming (stream is 'None').""` fulfills the user's request to confirm whether the correct username is 'shadoune666' or 'shadoune66666'. The model successfully used the data retrieved from the API call (`login: 'shadoune666'` and `stream: None`) to form its acknowledgment, indicating that the provided answer is derived from the tool's response and aligns with the user's input query. **Objective 3 is a success**."

For Objective 2: The required API call was `'reviews_list_for_kohls'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""4201989""}`. However, the actual API call invoked by the model was `'reviews_list_for_kohls'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""5372023""}`. The productid does not match, which is a critical failure for Objective 2.  
For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. Additionally, the final answer states that there were no reviews for product id `5372023`, but this information is irrelevant as the required product id was `4201989`. Therefore, the final answer does not fulfill the user's request."
38,"I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this product, including images, pricing, and customer reviews?",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Tools Invoked by the Model**:  
  The model made the following tool call:  
  `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments: `{""sku"":""X005789621""}`

- **Required API Calls**:  
  1. `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` with arguments: `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`
  2. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments: `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`

- Comparison:  
  The expected tool call for `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` had the SKU `W003247135`, but the tool call made by the model used an incorrect SKU, `X005789621`. Additionally, the model did not invoke the required call to `'products_detail_for_wayfair'`. As a result, the required API calls were not fully invoked, leading to a failure for **Objective 2**.

- Regarding **Objective 3**, the model explicitly stated it could not solve the user's question due to limitations in the toolset. Moreover, this conclusion was not derived from the proper usage of API calls, as the correct tools were not invoked with the correct arguments. Therefore, **Objective 3** is also marked as a failure."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- **Actual tool calls made by the model:**  
  1. `products_search_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""keyword"": ""X005789621""}`  
  2. `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""sku"": ""X005789621""}`  

- **Required API calls:**  
  1. `products_detail_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`  
  2. `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model did not include `products_detail_for_wayfair` or its arguments. Additionally, while the `reviews_list_for_wayfair` tool name matches with the required API call, the argument value provided (`""sku"": ""X005789621""`) does not match the required value (`""sku"": ""W003247135""`). Thus, the required API calls were not executed correctly.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Objective 2 is already a failure since the required tools and arguments were not accurately invoked. Additionally:  
- The model eventually calls the 'Finish' tool with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, choosing to give up and restart instead of providing the final answer. This means the user's instruction was not achieved, and no meaningful response was provided to the query."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"The required API calls were as follows:  
1. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

The model invoked the following API calls:  
1. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

Both the tool names and their intentions match the required API calls, even though the argument `""productid""` is lowercase compared to the expected `""productId""` - this difference is ignorable as long as the value `""B00K3OM3PS""` corresponds exactly. This ensures Objective 2 is successfully achieved.  

---

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The final answer has been derived directly from the retrieved API data. The answer includes:  
- Review information (4.7 average rating, total ratings: 6421, break-down of % star ratings).  
- Product name: `""Coffret intÃ©grale Harry Potter [Blu-ray]""`, URL, and an image.  
- Offer details: Sold by ""7th ART"" along with the Product Offers Listings URL.  

These details explicitly align with the data retrieved using the API calls. The instruction to provide product information related to ID ""B00K3OM3PS"" is fulfilled successfully. There is no made-up information, as all details were validated against the API responses."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",5,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- For Objective 2:
    - The provided required API calls are:  
        1. **`get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`** with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  
        2. **`get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`** with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  
        3. **`get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`** with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  

    - The model invoked the following tool calls:  
        1. **`get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`** with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  
        2. **`get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`** with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  
        3. **`get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`** with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  

    The parameter matches align semantically despite differences in casing between ""productId"" and ""productid"", which is acceptable. Therefore, all the required API calls were correctly invoked, making **Objective 2 a success**.  

- For Objective 3: 
    - The final answer provided by the model is incomplete and garbled. The ""final_answer"" contains malfunctioning or nonsensical content with jumbled text rather than a coherent or user-informed summary derived from the API responses.  
    - Furthermore, the final tool call intended to retrieve the answer is erroneous (returning `{error:""must have 'return_type'""}`), which confirms that the model failed to deliver a proper output to the user?™s instruction and could not assimilate and use the data gathered effectively through API calls. Thus, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call (`select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with `{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }`) is not invoked by the model. Instead, the model executed an irrelevant tool (`Finish` with `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`). As the expected tool call was not made, this leads to a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since the model failed to execute the required API call, it did not have the means to fetch the necessary data to fulfil the user's instruction. Moreover, the model's final answer was essentially giving up and restarting instead of responding to the user's request correctly. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
   The required API call was:  
   ```  
   'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with arguments '{
     ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""
   }'
   ```  
   The actual tool call made by the model was:  
   ```  
   'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}'  
   ```  
   The tool name (`select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`) and the argument (`is_id: ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`) exactly match the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success. Additional unnecessary tools invoked (like the 'Finish' tool) are acceptable based on the evaluation guidelines.  

- For Objective 3:  
   The model correctly extracted data from the API response:  
   ``` json
   {'_id': '6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7', 'race_no': 1, 'track': 'FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022', 'date': '2022-03-19T15:00:00.000Z', '__v': 0}
   ```  
   It used this data to generate the following final answer:  
   ```  
   ""The F1 race you are interested in is the 'FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022.' It is the race number 1, and it took place on March 19, 2022, at 3:00 PM (UTC). You now know the details to plan accordingly!""  
   ```  
   This answer is directly based on the data extracted from the API tool call. Also, this answer fulfills the user's instruction of providing details about the F1 race. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments `{ ""Symbol"": ""TQQQ"" }`. However, the model did not invoke any tools (`'tool_calls': None`). Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  
For Objective 3, since the model did not give a final answer (and considering Objective 2 also failed), Objective 3 fails as well because the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected API call is:  
`get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`.  

The model actually invoked:  
`get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`.  

The tool name and the argument exactly match with the expected API call. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer is:  
""Sure! Here are the base stats for the champion 'Riven':  
- HP: 630.0 (+100.0 per level)  
- HP Regen: 8.5 (+0.5 per level)  
- Mana: 0.0 (+0.0 per level) [Riven does not use mana but energy]  
- Mana Regen: 0.0 (+0.0 per level)  
- Attack Damage: 64.0 (+3.0 per level)  
- Attack Speed: 0.625 (+3.5% per level)  
- Armor: 33.0 (+4.4 per level)  
- Magic Resist: 32.0 (+2.05 per level)  
- Movement Speed: 340.0  
- Range: 125.0  

It accurately reflects the data retrieved from the API call, meaning the model effectively used the tool response to generate its final output. As the answer fulfills the user's request, Objective 3 is also a success."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool call was:  
- `'name': 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data'` with `'arguments': '{\n  ""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""\n }'`.  

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
- `'name': 'Finish'` with `'arguments': '{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}'`.  

The required tool call doesn't match the tool actually invoked by the model. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the model did not provide the final answer and did not achieve the user's instruction."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2 Evaluation:**
    - The required API call:  
      `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with arguments: `{ ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""toLang"": ""fr"" }`.
    - The actual tool call made by the model:  
      `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with arguments: `'{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr""}'`.
      
    The invoked tool call uses the correct tool name (`translate_for_translate_all_languages`) and semantically matches the required arguments (`text` is the same, and `toLang` in the required call is written as `tolang` in the actual call, which is acceptable as they maintain semantic equivalence). The outcome aligns with guidance #3 and #4; therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

- **Objective 3 Evaluation:**
    - The model's final answer is:  
      `""The text 'Hello, how are you?' translated into French ('fr') is: 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'.""`.
    - The tool response successfully provides the correct translated text `""Bonjour comment allez-vous?""`, and the model's final answer utilizes this output accurately to achieve the user?™s instruction of translating the text into French. Hence, the output is based on valid tool data, fulfilling Objective 3."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**
- **Actual tool calls by the model:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      ""name"": ""get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days"",
      ""arguments"": ""{\""country_code\"":\""US\"",\""date\"":\""2022-12-31\""}""
    }
  ]
  ```
- **Required API calls:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      ""name"": ""get_info_day_for_working_days"",
      ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""country_code\"": \""US\"",\n  \""date\"": \""2022-12-31\""\n }""
    }
  ]
  ```

The comparison shows that:
1. The tool names match conceptually. Although the tool invocation by the model appears as `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days`, this is likely a variant or alias for the correct API call, `get_info_day_for_working_days`, due to possible truncation. 
2. The arguments match completely (""country_code"": `""US""` and ""date"": `""2022-12-31""`).  

Since all required tool calls are executed accurately (tool name and arguments are valid), **Objective 2 is a success.**  

---

**Objective 3:**
- The final answer provided is: `""The date '2022-12-31' is not a working day in the US. It is a weekend day.""`
- The response from the tool provides the necessary information:
  ```json
  {
    ""working_day"": 0,
    ""weekend_day"": 1
  }
  ```
  This indicates that the provided date is not a working day and is, in fact, a weekend day.

The final response correctly uses the information retrieved from the tool and fulfills the user's instruction to analyze whether the given date is a working day in the US. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a success.**"
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
The actual tool call made by the model:  
- Tool: `get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days` with arguments: `{""start_date"":""2013-01-01"",""end_date"":""2013-12-31"",""country_code"":""US""}`.  

The required API call:  
- Tool: `analyse_for_working_days` with arguments: `{\n ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",\n ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"",\n ""country_code"": ""US""\n }`.  

Despite the slight difference in tool name (`get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days` vs. `analyse_for_working_days`), the arguments are identical and semantically equivalent to the required API call. Since additional parameters are not present in the actual tool call, and the required components are preserved in full, this satisfies Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the model provided a coherent final answer derived correctly from the data obtained via the API call. Specifically, the response contained details about the total number of calendar days, working days, weekends, public holidays, and specific holidays. The final answer aligns directly with the user's requirement to analyze working days and incorporates data from the API response. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
   - **Expected Tool Call:**  
     ```  
     {'name': 'add_working_hours_for_working_days', 'arguments': '{  
        ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",  
        ""country_code"": ""US"",  
        ""start_time"": ""08:15"",  
        ""increment_time"": 2004  
     }'}  
     ```  
   - **Actual Tool Call Made by the Model:**  
     ```  
     {'id': 'call_v0Nyy6KikGnQhJLHHwto4u4H', 'function': {'arguments': '{""start_date"":""2013-12-31"",""country_code"":""US"",""start_time"":""08:15"",""increment_time"":""2004:00""}', 'name': 'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'}, 'type': 'function'}  
     ```  
   - Issues: The name of the tool invoked by the model (`get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days`) does not exactly match the required tool name (`add_working_hours_for_working_days`). This leads to a mismatch. Additionally, the `increment_time` parameter value is incorrect as the required value is `2004`, but the model provided `""2004:00""` with an unrelated syntax error.  
   
Thus, the tool invocation is deemed a failure under Objective 2.  

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
   - Since Objective 2 resulted in failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails as the user's instructions could not have been fulfilled correctly."
