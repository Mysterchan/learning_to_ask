1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',7,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Expected Tool Calls**: 
  - Tool Name: `search_for_netflix_v2`  
  - Arguments: `{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""}`  

- **Actual Tool Calls**:  
  1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions"", ""limit_titles"":1}'`  
  2. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions"", ""limit_titles"":1}'`  
  3. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions"", ""limit_titles"":1}'`  

The tool name `search_for_netflix_v2` is correct, and the required argument `""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""` is present in the actual tool calls. Even though `""limit_titles"": 1` is an additional argument, per the guidelines, additional arguments do not affect correctness. Hence, all required tool calls have been invoked correctly. **Objective 2 passes.**  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model is: `""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""` However, the expected outcome was to utilize the API response for information related to ""The Matrix Revolutions."" Instead, the model simplistically declared a limitation without adequately referring to the tool responses to assist user requirements. Therefore, **Objective 3 fails.**"
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- For **Objective 2**, the required tool call is '`search_for_netflix_v2`' with the argument `'{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}'`. However, the actual tool call made by the model is '`search_for_netflix_v2`' with the argument `'{""query"":""star wars"",""limit_titles"":1}'`.  
The tool name '`search_for_netflix_v2`' matches between the required and actual call, but the argument '`query`' is neither a close semantic match to `'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'` nor explicitly specifies it. As such, the intent of the `query` argument differs, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

- For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed to satisfy the expected API call (and the necessary data is not retrieved correctly as a result), the model's answer cannot correctly achieve the user's instruction. Moreover, the final interactions also show that the model ended with a call involving '`Finish`' and chose ""give up and restart"" rather than providing a valid response. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Analysis:**
1. **Expected Tool Calls**:  
   `[{ 'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{\n ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"",\n ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""\n }'}]`  

2. **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model**:  
    Tool: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`  
    Arguments: `{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}`  

The actual tool matches the name `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` and uses the correct arguments (`""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""`), as specified in the expected API call. Note that the argument formatting (spacing) differences are irrelevant and do not affect correctness. Therefore, Objective 2 is **Successful**.  

**Objective 3 Analysis:**  
The model utilized information from the tool response, as it provided a final answer detailed description of the drawing outcomes (e.g., the sorted winning number sets along with their dates and times from December 1 to December 31, 2023). Additionally, the fulfilled user instruction stemmed directly from the results supplied by the tool, indicating that the final response was based on accurate API call data. Accordingly, Objective 3 is also **Successful**."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call is `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`. However, the actual tool call made by the model is `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `{""timezone"":""UTC+03:00"",""limit"":50}`. Although the tool name matches and the ""timezone"" parameter is correct, the addition of the ""limit"" parameter in the model's call led to an error with the response saying the `limit` exceeds the value permissible. This essentially makes the tool invocation invalid and hence does not achieve the same intent. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 already failed, this means the model could not effectively achieve the user's instruction using authorized API calls. Furthermore, the model concludes by invoking the `Finish` tool with end-state `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which indicates that the task was deliberately abandoned without meeting the requirements. As such, Objective 3 is a failure."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the tool invoked by the model was `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"":""2022-12-18""}`, which matched perfectly with the required API call `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`. Hence, Objective 2 is successful. However, for Objective 3, while the tool was invoked accurately, the model stated in its final response, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question as I could not retrieve any information about the scores of the football matches played on 2022-12-18."" This response fails to fulfill the user's instruction to specify the date of the last World Cup final. The definitive answer was not derived from valid API data or provided appropriately. Thus, Objective 3 failed."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""query"":""teaching jobs in London"",""country"":""gb"",""num_pages"":""1""}'`  
2. `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""query"":""teaching jobs in London"",""country"":""gb"",""num_pages"":""2""}'`  
3. `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""query"":""teaching jobs in London"",""country"":""gb"",""page"":2}'`  

The query arguments `""teaching jobs in London""` deviate from the expected `""teaching in London""`. While they are similar, they are **not semantically the same**, primarily because ""teaching jobs in London"" specifies job-related queries, whereas ""teaching in London"" is a broader query without the ""job"" context. Therefore, the argument mismatch caused this to fail Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 was a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails. The final answer provided by the model cannot be validated against the user's instructions as the expected API tool behavior was incorrect."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call specifies the usage of the tool `search_for_jsearch` with the argument:  
```  
{
  ""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York""
}
```  
However, in the invoked tool calls by the model, the arguments for the `search_for_jsearch` tool contain a slightly different query: `""mechanical engineer in new york""`. The key component here is the incorrect spelling differences between ""machanical"" in the required call and the correct thus incorrect Thinkclaimer<caret"
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",5,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- The tools invoked by the model are: 
  1. `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Ronaldo LuÃ­s""}`.  
  2. `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""is_id"": 3140}`.  
- The required API calls are: 
  1. `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}`.  
  2. `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""is_id"": 3140}`.  
- Comparison:  
  - In the first tool call, even though the argument `""query""` is `""Ronaldo LuÃ­s""` instead of `""Ronaldo""`, its intent aligns closely with identifying the same individual in the search space by the query's meaning. Additional narrowing via `""Luis""` refines the search, but it does not deviate in functionality. Hence, it fulfills the required call criteria.  
  - The second tool call `""players_get_profile_for_transfermarket""` matches perfectly with the required API call.  
Thus, all expected API calls were invoked correctly, leading to a **success for Objective 2**.  

For Objective 3:  
The model used data from the API responses to derive its final answer. Specifically:  
- The response of the `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` API provided player details like the full name (""Ronaldo LuÃ­s NazÃ¡rio de Lima""), height (1.83 m), birthplace, date of birth (18th September 1976), team and international achievements, and other relevant details, all of which were used in the final answer sentence.
- The finalized synthesized answer given to the user (""Ronaldo LuÃ­s NazÃ¡rio de Lima, famously known as Ronaldo... For more information, visit the profile here"") directly references this API data.  

Thus, the final answer accurately fulfills the user's instruction and depends on API-generated data, leading to a **success for Objective 3**."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments:  
  `{ ""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }`.  

The actual tool call invoked is:  
- `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments:  
  `{ ""location"": ""New York"", ""job_title"": ""Software Developer"", ""radius"": 200 }`.  

While the tool name matches, the additional argument `""radius"": 200` does not compromise correctness. However, according to the rules for evaluation, spelling inconsistencies (like capitalizing `Software Developer` instead of using the specified lowercase `software developer`) fail to match the expectations fully. Hence, **Objective 2** fails.

For **Objective 3**, given that Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also directly fails. Further, even if evaluated independently, the final answer incorrectly links mismatched or missing API data, and introduces unsubstantiated additional claims such as opportunities and job links into its output. Hence, the fulfillment of the user?™s instruction is not successfully achieved."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""query"": ""\'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\'""\n }'}

```  
{'function': {'name': 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search', 'arguments': '{""query"":""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""}'}}

11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The required API call is `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}'`. However, the actual tool call made by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`. The model completely failed to invoke the required tool, making it a failure for Objective 2.  
 
- **Objective 3:** Since the model gave up the task and chose to restart without providing a valid final answer derived from any retrieved data, Objective 3 is also a failure."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `{""season"": ""2020""}`. However, the actual tool calls made by the model include only one unnecessary API call to `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, which does not match or fulfill the required API tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 has already failed and no final answer was provided (`return_type: ""give_answer""` does not appear in the log), we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,8,3,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  

*Objective 2:*
The expected API call is:
- Tool: `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'`
- Argument: `'{""tournament_id"": ""650""}'`

The actual tool calls made by the model are:
- Tool: `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with Argument: `'{""tournament_id"":650}'` (called multiple times).

The tool name matches, and the argument `""tournament_id"": 650` matches the required argument semantically (integer and string notations, in this instance, convey the same intention). The API calls align with the expected calls, making this a success for Objective 2.

---

*Objective 3:*
The model repeatedly calls the required tool but does not provide a final answer (there is no `final_answer` in the provided data). Instead, the model continues asking follow-up questions or attempting refinement, but it fails to fulfill the user's instructions effectively. Since no final answer is provided, this results in failure for Objective 3."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  ```  
  {'name': 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis',  
   'arguments': '{\n  ""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"",\n  ""n_players"": ""10"",\n  ""category"": ""singles""\n }'}
  ```  
- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  ```  
  {'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'}
  ```  
- The model called the incorrect tool (""Finish"") instead of the required tool ""official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis"". Additionally, none of the required arguments were included. As such, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
- Since there was no final answer provided by the model and it chose to ""give up and restart"", the user's instruction to retrieve the specific rankings could not be achieved. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `{""season"":""2012"",""category"":""returnpointswon2ndserve"",""surface"":""clay""}`  

The expected tool call is:  
- `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `{ ""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }`  

The model invoked the correct tool name but used an incorrect argument for `""category""`. Instead of the correct `""category"": ""return""`, it used `""category"": ""returnpointswon2ndserve""`. Since this failed to match closely enough with the expected tool call arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the final response `""chose to give up and restart""` does not fulfill the user's request, and no valid final answer was provided."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
The tool expected is `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""base"": ""RMB"",
  ""to"": ""GBP""
}
```
The tool invoked by the model is `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""base"": ""CNY"",
  ""to"": ""GBP""
}
```

The two requests are equivalent in meaning. ""RMB"" (Renminbi) is the same as ""CNY"" (the code for the Chinese Yuan in the ISO standard). We consider the argument to have appropriately met the required semantic meaning, and the tool name matches exactly. Thus, the invoked tool matches the expected tool call.  

- **Objective 3**:  
The final output provided:  
> ""The current exchange rate from Chinese RMB (CNY) to British Pound (GBP) is approximately 0.11218. This means 1 CNY equals approximately 0.11 GBP. (Last update: Jan 21, 2025)""  

This final answer aligns with the data retrieved from the API response, specifically:  
```json
""data"": [{""rate"": ""0.112180"", ""calculatedstr"": ""0.11"", ""lastupdate"": ""Jan 21, 2025""}]
```  
This confirms that the final answer was derived directly from the API response and fulfills the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is also achieved successfully."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`. The actual tool call is `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`. Both the tool name and arguments exactly match the required API call, fulfilling the requirement of Objective 2.  
For **Objective 3**, the model successfully retrieved the TikTok user profile using the API call, and the final answer provided includes all relevant details derived directly from the tool response, such as the username, nickname, avatar links, and user ID. Therefore, the user's instruction is fully met, and the final answer is based on the data retrieved from the API call."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls specified are:
  1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`

  3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`

  However, the tool invoked by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`. This is completely unrelated to the required tool calls, which indicates that none of the expected API calls were made. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as none of the required API calls have been executed, and hence, a valid response could not be generated. Additionally, no final answer was given to address the user's instruction."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"- **Expected API Calls:**

  3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  

All the required tool names and arguments match exactly with the expected tool calls. Additionally, no substantial spelling errors, mismatches, or issues with required arguments were detected. This indicates a **success** for Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:**
- The final answer provided by the model is as follows:
  ```
  Here is the detailed analysis of Janover (stock symbol: JNVR):
  
  1. **Index Trend History**:
     - 0 Quarter Growth: 0.09 (Raw: 0.0866)
     - +1 Quarter Growth: 0.12 (Raw: 0.1151)
     - 0 Year Growth: 0.14 (Raw: 0.1405)
     - +1 Year Growth: 0.13 (Raw: 0.1339)
     - Long Term Growth: 0.08 (Raw: 0.077)
  
  2. **Balance Sheet Data**:
     - Quarterly and Annual historical data show an empty results set in this instance.
  
  3. **Institution Ownership Details** (Key Institutions):
     - Perritt Capital Management, Inc.:
       - Percentage Held: 0.04%
       - Position: 4.86k shares valued at ~$28.2k
       - Percentage Change: 0%
     - Raymond James Financial Services Advisors, Inc.:
       - Percentage Held: 0.02%
       - Position: 2.37k shares valued at ~$13.76k
       - Percentage Change: 0%
  ```
- The answer aligns with the data retrieved from the actual tool calls, which contained:
  1. Index trend growth data from `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'`
  2. Empty balance sheet data from `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'`
  3. Institution ownership details from `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'`

All values and information shown in the final answer are directly based on the retrieved data, with no evidence of makeup or fabricated values. Moreover, the user's instruction to aggregate stock-related details for ""Janover (JNVR)"" has been comprehensively fulfilled. Hence, this marks a success for Objective 3."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,3,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- For Objective 2:  
  The required API call was:  
  `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{ ""symbol"": ""NVDA"" }`.  
  
  The tool actually invoked by the model was:  
  `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"":""NVDA""}`.  
  
  The tool name and the argument exactly match the required API call. Since all the expected tool calls were invoked correctly (with no spelling or semantic discrepancies), Objective 2 is a success.

- For Objective 3:  
  The model's final response utilized the data fetched from the API call and effectively achieved the user's request:  
  The final answer was derived directly from the API response and incorporated relevant information obtained from it, including metrics like P/E Ratio, PEG Ratio, and growth estimates. These values align with the data contained in the tool response, demonstrating proper usage of the API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""DJR""}` was not invoked by the model. In fact, no tool calls were invoked at all as indicated by `""tool_calls"": None`. Therefore, Objective 2 is considered a failure. For Objective 3, the final answer was not provided by the model. Furthermore, the failure of Objective 2 implies that the user's instruction could not have been fulfilled based on expected invocation. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the tool invoked by the model was:  
```  
'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"":""META""}'
```  
The required tool call was:  
```  
'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{
  ""symbol"": ""META""
}'  
```  
The tool name is a perfect match, and the argument `""symbol"": ""META""` also matches exactly as required. Thus, the tool call satisfies the requirement and is deemed correct.

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model was:  
```  
'The stock index trend for the Facebook (Meta Platforms Inc., META) is available:  
- S&P 500 (SP5) Index:  
    - Growth in the current quarter (0q): 0.09 (Approx. 8.66%)  
    - Growth in the next quarter (+1q): 0.12 (Approx. 11.51%)  
    - Growth in the current year (0y): 0.14 (Approx. 14.05%)  
    - Growth next year (+1y): 0.13 (Approx. 13.39%)  
    - Long-term Growth (LTG): 0.08 (Approx. 7.7%).  
Let me know if you need further insights or details!'  
```  
This information is derived directly from the API call response:  
```  
{
  'meta': {'version': 'v1.0', 'status': 200, ... 'symbol': 'META', ... }, 
  'body': {'symbol': 'SP5', ... 'estimates': [ ... growth details ... ]}
}
```  
The growth data such as 0.09, 0.12, 0.14, etc., are extracted directly from the argument outputs of the `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` tool call. Thus, the final response correctly fulfills the user's instruction to provide the stock index trend for META, and the answer is strictly based on API data, meeting Objective 3."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
`'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}'`.  

The actual API call made by the model was:  
`'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"":""shadoune666""}'`.  

The tool name and the arguments match exactly, indicating that the model invoked the required tool call correctly with expected arguments. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the model's final answer was:  
`""The streamer 'shadoune666' is currently not streaming (stream: None). You can reference their Twitch ID as 36533048 for further detail or track future streaming activities.""`.  

This answer fulfills the user's instruction and was derived from the tool's response: `""user"": {""id"": ""36533048"", ""login"": ""shadoune666"", ""stream"": None}`. The final answer relies on the data retrieved from the tool and satisfies the provided task of confirming the streaming status and providing additional information. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected tool call is:  
`video_details_for_tiktok_api` with arguments `'{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}'`.  
The model invocation, however, calls the tool `video_details_for_tiktok_api` but with empty arguments (`{}`). The required argument, `""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""`, is missing both times the tool is invoked in the provided context. This discrepancy in arguments leads to a failure in meeting Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, given the failure in Objective 2, the required data could not be retrieved. The user's request to fetch details of the specified TikTok video (with ID `""7097255034731138310""`) was not fulfilled. Subsequently, the final response only states the inability to fetch engagement details while speculating about alternative options, which does not satisfy the user's original instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- Tool name: `historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes`  
- Arguments: `{""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4hour"", ""from"": ""2024-01-01"", ""to"": ""2024-12-30""}`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- Tool name: `historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes`  
- Arguments: `{""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4hour""}`  

The actual arguments are missing the required `""from"": ""2024-01-01""` and `""to"": ""2024-12-30""` fields necessary to define the timeframe for the query. Due to this deviation, **Objective 2** fails.  

For **Objective 3**, the model chose to later invoke an additional tool call (`Finish`) with the argument to ""give up and restart,"" meaning the model essentially chose not to fulfill the user's query. Moreover, it did not provide a final answer fulfilling the user's intent. Since **Objective 2** failed, we can directly infer **Objective 3** is also a failure."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,5,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
- **Expected API call:**  
   Tool name: `ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
   Arguments: `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC""}`  

- **Actual tool call:**  
   Tool name: `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
   Arguments: `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""BTC"", ""symbol"": ""USDT"", ""gran"": ""1m"", ""accept"": ""application/json"", ""sort"": ""asc""}`  

Issues:  
1. The tool name expected (`ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`) does not match the actual tool invocation name (`ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`). While they seem to refer to a similar purpose, the substitution is inadmissible because of the spelling inconsistency.  
2. The expected `""base"": ""USDT""` and `""symbol"": ""BTC""` are inverted to `""base"": ""BTC""` and `""symbol"": ""USDT""` in the arguments of the actual tool call. Such a change affects semantic correctness. This is a critical failure because the values and contexts are swapped, leading to incorrect parameter usage.
3. Additional arguments in the actual call (`""gran"": ""1m"", ""accept"": ""application/json"", ""sort"": ""asc""`) are allowed, but they cannot rectify the aforementioned mistakes (as per Rule 1).

Thus, the tool invocation does not align with the requirements, resulting in **failure** for **Objective 2**.

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
Because Objective 2 is a failure, it automatically implies Failure for Objective 3. The invalid tool calls result in inappropriate handling of the user's query, and the model gave up and did not provide any final answer fulfilling the user's instruction. Hence, **Objective 3** fails."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with `{""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""start_date"": ""2022-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-30""}`  
2. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with `{""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT"", ""start_date"": ""2022-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-30""}`  

The required API calls were:  
1. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with:  
```  
{  
  ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"",  
  ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"",

}  
```  

The tool names were correct (`time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` in both cases), but the arguments deviated significantly from the required ones. The timeframe differs between the actual and expected calls; the tools were invoked with `start_date: ""2022-01-01""` and `end_date: ""2022-12-30""`, while the required timeframe was from `""2022-12-01""` to `""2022-12-20""`. This significant discrepancy renders the actual tool calls incorrect, failing Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed, it directly implies Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model's final response does not provide specific answers to fulfill the user's instruction but instead shifts to ask for smaller time segments and eventually refers to ""give up and restart."" This indicates the model did not achieve the required task based on the API results or the original user query."

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
The model did provide a final answer and based it on the information retrieved from the APIs. However, the final response contains a significant amount of unnecessary text (e.g., nonsensical or incoherent elements: ""Sob Obligationsaptors markets `[Decenture-.2.uniform ... blocked`""). These errors in formatting or illegible text disrupt the coherence and usability of the data provided. This suggests that the instructions regarding presenting the requested analysis concisely and clearly were not met, causing a failure for Objective 3."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2:**  
- The actual tool calls invoked by the model:  
  1. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13""}`  
  2. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT"", ""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13""}`  
   
- The required API calls:  
  1. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`  
  2. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT""}`  

Aside from differences in formatting order, the actual tool call arguments are semantically correct and match the required calls completely. Hence, all required API calls were made accurately.  

For **Objective 3:**  
- The final answer provided is:  
  `""For the specified period from February 10 to February 13, 2024, here are the historical rates in USD for gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT):\n\nGold (XAU)\n- 2024-02-10: 0.0004939835 XAU/USD\n- 2024-02-11: 0.00049369 XAU/USD\n- 2024-02-12: 0.000495302 XAU/USD\n- 2024-02-13: 0.0005021685 XAU/USD...\n\nPlatinum (XPT)\n...""`  

The model used the retrieved results from the `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` responses to construct its final answer. Looking at provided data, the historical rates match and fulfill the user's instructions (providing rates in USD for gold and platinum for the specified period between February 10 and February 13, 2024). Therefore, the final response was derived from the API and achieves the user's request."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is as follows:  

```
{
  ""name"": ""market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance"",
  ""arguments"": '{\n  ""interval"": ""y1"",\n ""is_id"": ""02823""\n  }'

```

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include the following:  
1. **Tool Name**: `market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance` with arguments: `{""query"":""02823""}`  
2. **Tool Name**: `market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance` with arguments: `{""query"":""iShares FTSE A50 China Index ETF""}`  

The required tool call (`market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance`) was not invoked by the model at any point. The tools invoked by the model used a completely different API (`market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance`) which does not match the expected API (`market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance`). Consequently, this results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since the required tool was not invoked (and therefore no relevant data was retrieved regarding the requested ""price chart"" for `02823`), the model couldn?™t provide a final answer fulfilling the user's instruction. The model also admitted the limitation of toolsets in its last response. Thus, the user's instruction was not achieved, and Objective 3 is considered a failure."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:   
- **Objective 2**:  
   - The actual tool calls invoked by the model include this call:  
     - `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date"":""01-02-2024""}`  
   - The required API calls are:  
     - `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""01-02-2024"" }`  
   - Comparing the tool invoked and the required API call shows they match perfectly in tool name and required arguments, achieving success for Objective 2.  
     
- **Objective 3**:  
   - The final answer provided in:  
     - `""The winning Fantasy 5 numbers for January 2, 2024 had two drawings:\\n\\n1. Midday drawing: 5, 15, 17, 28, 30\\n2. Evening drawing: 14, 15, 28, 32, 33""`  
   - This answer matches directly and accurately with the data fetched from the `drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5` API results, incorporating the numbers for both the Midday and Evening drawings. The answer fulfills the requirement and is clearly derived from the API data, confirming success for Objective 3."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the following tool:  
- `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}`  

The required API call was:  
- `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}`  

The tool name and the argument names and values fully match the expected API call. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model is:  
_""Here are the winning Fantasy 5 number sets for December 2023:  
1. December 31, MIDDAY: 10, 17, 22, 23, 25

5. December 29, MIDDAY: 3, 7, 18, 27, 35... and more sets available. For a complete and detailed list, consider accessing the full results provided. Contact me if more specifics are required!""_  

This final answer correctly utilizes the data retrieved from the tool call, which can be validated based on the dataset present in the 'tool' response. It fulfills the user's requirement of retrieving the fantasy 5 drawings for the specified date range of December 2023. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,2,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

- For Objective 2:  
  The actual tool calls invoked by the model include: 
  ```json
  [{'id': 'call_aRpEZvDvW2BrbGusDCEb2cp4', 'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""The total number of coins you have is 15 (5 coins from Pocket 1 and 10 coins from Pocket 2).""}', 'name': 'Finish'}, 'type': 'function'}]
  ```

  The expected tool call was:
  ```json
  [{'name': 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""variables"": """",\n  ""values"": """",\n  ""expression"": ""5+10""\n}'}]
  ```

  The actual and expected tool names (`'Finish'` vs. `'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'`) and their arguments do not match at all. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- For Objective 3:  
  Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 is also a failure without further evaluation. Furthermore, while the model's final answer (""The total number of coins you have is 15 (5 coins from Pocket 1 and 10 coins from Pocket 2)"") appears correct based on its content, it failed to use expected API calls to derive this answer, instead making up the response independently. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:** The required API call was `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}`. The actual tool calls by the model were two separate calls of `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2`, each having arguments for individual IDs (`{""is_id"": ""44196397""}` and `{""is_id"": ""155659213""}` respectively). While the name of the tools invoked (`user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2`) is similar to the expected but not exact (`users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`), the fundamental issue is that the tool split the request into two separate calls instead of consolidating them as required in a single call with both IDs combined. This mismatch indicates a failure.

**Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. In addition, though two tool calls were made, the model's failure to properly consolidate the required API calls means the final response could not satisfy the user's instructional requirements. For example, the final assistant reply indicated, ""Due to the limitation of the toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" which further confirms the failed response."
35,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation in the most famous island of the USA and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool calls are:  
1. `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `'{""q"": ""\'images of the beaches at Hawaii island\'""}'`  
2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `'{""q"": ""\'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island\'""}'`.  

However, no tools were invoked by the model (`'tool_calls': None`). Since the required tool calls were not made, this results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer, nor fulfill the user's instruction but rather explained the lack of capability, which does not address the user's requirements directly. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"1st tool call: `{""q"":""popular romantic restaurants in Paris"",""num"":""10"",""location_parameters_auto"":true,""location_name"":""Paris""}`  
2nd tool call: `{""q"":""popular romantic restaurants in Paris"",""num"":""10""}`  

Whereas, the required API call is:  
`search_for_g_search` with arguments: `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""}`  

The argument 'q' in both actual tool calls by the model specifies `'popular romantic restaurants in Paris'`, but the required call specifies `'popular restaurants in Paris'`, which introduces semantic deviations in answering the query. The addition of ""romantic"" and the numerical values of ""num"" are also separate. Hence, Objective 2 fails because the `q` parameters do not correctly align with the prompt requirement.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 automatically fails. Furthermore, while the model did provide a final answer, the input arguments (as evident from Objective 2) and their subsequent results deviated from the requirement. Hence, the final answer did not fulfill the user's instruction based on the required API data."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",8,3,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- For Objective 2:  
  - The required tool call is:  
    ```  
    {'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""jackie""\n  }'}  
    ```  
  - The model invoked the tool `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` multiple times with the correct argument:  
    ```
    {""username"": ""jackie""}
    ```
    Hence, all required tool calls were executed correctly.

- For Objective 3:  
  - The model did not provide a valid conclusive answer based on the retrieved API responses. The final output indicated it could not validate whether ""jackie"" was Jackie Chan?™s official Instagram handle. This did not satisfy the user's original request to confirm Jackie Chan's Instagram username or retrieve information tied to his official profile. 
  - While the tools were invoked properly, the model's response suggested giving up on fulfilling the task rather than leveraging the retrieved data or iterating meaningfully on it. Hence, Objective 3 fails."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls listed were:

1. **country_details_for_referential_db** with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""NG"" }`.  
2. **states_for_referential_db** with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""NG"" }`.

The actual tool calls made by the model were:

1. **countries_for_referential_db** with arguments `{}`.

The model called the tool **countries_for_referential_db**, but no tools named either **country_details_for_referential_db** or **states_for_referential_db** were invoked. Additionally, the arguments for the invoked tool did not align with the expected arguments. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, the model failed to achieve the user's instruction. The user's request involved identifying the richest African country based on certain criteria, yet the model did not utilize the given tools appropriately to gather this data. Additionally, the final assistant statement suggests that it could not solve the task (""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""). Therefore, the user's instructions were not achieved, and Objective 3 is a failure."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`  

Actual tool calls invoked by the model:   
1. `countries_for_referential_db` with `{}`  
2. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""AL""}`  
3. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""AL""}`  

Evaluation:  
The required API calls involve retrieving details for Ukraine (`""countryCode"": ""UA""`). However, the actual API calls did not involve Ukraine but instead refer to Albania (`""countrycode"": ""AL""`). Additionally, note the difference in parameter key capitalization (`""countryCode""` in the required call and `""countrycode""` in the actual call). Since the required tool calls were not invoked correctly, this is a **failure** for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed (the necessary data on Ukraine was not retrieved using the required tool calls), we directly infer failure for Objective 3. The final answer generated by the model pertains to Albania, while the instructions focused on identifying the next poorest country in Europe excluding Ukraine, explicitly needing tools targeting Ukraine."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""MY"" }`.  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""MY"" }`.

The model made the following corresponding actual tool calls:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""MY""}`.  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""MY""}`.  

Although there is a slight difference in the case of the argument name for `countryCode` (actual tool calls used `""countrycode""` instead of `""countryCode""`), this is deemed not to affect tool call correctness based on the guideline (technical case differences can be ignored, as intent is intact). Therefore, **all expected tools were correctly invoked**, leading to the success in Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**, the model failed to provide the correct final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Based on the user's original inquiry, the task was to identify ""the richest country in Asia"" using economic metrics (e.g., GDP per capita), alongside providing specific details such as its state information with locations (latitude/longitude). Instead, the model incorrectly claims that Malaysia fulfills the richest criteria without justification via the API data or mention of verifying GDP per capita metrics. Additionally, the generated ""final_answer"" field contains incoherent, broken, and unrelated text fragments.

Therefore, the reported result was neither clearly derived from the required API data nor does it correctly answer the user's instruction, leading to **failure** for Objective 3."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2 (Failure)** -  
   The required API calls are:  
   - `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with `{'countryCode': 'IN'}`
   - `'states_for_referential_db'` with `{'countryCode': 'IN'}`  

   The actual tool invoked by the model is:  
   - `'countries_for_referential_db'` with `{}` (No arguments passed).  

   These calls do not match the required API calls either in terms of the tool name or their arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

2. **Objective 3 (Failure)** -  
   Since Objective 2 is a failure, the information needed to fulfill the user's instruction was not retrieved. As a result, the model shifts its focus to proposing exploratory guidance or prematurely answers with a restart/cancellation instead of completing the user's request. This signifies failure to fulfill the user's intended task of identifying the most populated untapped option and providing its details effectively. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
1. To achieve Objective 2, the model must utilize all required API calls as specified.  
   - **Required API call**: 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with arguments: `{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}`  
   - **Actual API call by the model**: 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with arguments: `{""query"":""romantic restaurants, New York"",""limit"":10}`  
     - While the tool name matches (`search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper`), the argument values for `""query""` are semantically different. The required API call seeks ""restaurants, NY, USA,"" while the actual call conducted a more specific and constrained query for ""romantic restaurants, New York."" This specificity alters the search intention, thus failing Objective 2.  

2. Failure of Objective 3 directly follows from the failure of Objective 2. Since the model failed to invoke the correct required API tools with accurate arguments, the effect is that the user's requirement - to search for ""restaurants, NY, USA"" - was not appropriately fulfilled. Furthermore, the provided final output mixes two restaurants (""Claud,"" and ""The River CafÃ©"") suggesting unclear fulfillment of the core request, culminating in Objective 3's failure.  ï¸?

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  							
- **Expected tool calls:**   							
  1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{""""q"""": """"After Everything""""}'`  							
  2. `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{""""is_id"""": """"84915-after-everything""""}'`  							
							
- **Actual tool calls by the model:**  							
  1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{""""q"""":""""After Everything""""}'`  							
  2. `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{""""is_id"""":""""84915-after-everything""""}'`  							
							
The tool name and all required arguments match exactly between the expected and actual tool calls. Hence	 **Objective 2 is a success.**  						
							
**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  							
- Final answer:  							
  `""""I found some similar movies to 'After Everything (2023)':  							
							
1. **Beautiful Disaster (2023):** A romantic film about a complicated relationship set in a college environment. It explores elements of love	 troubled pasts	 and campus-life relationships. Rated 5.3.  					
							
2. **Love at First Sight (2023):** Another romance-themed movie. Its theme focuses on love and serendipity between two unlikely individuals.""""`  							
							
The retrieved results were derived from the second tool call `find_similar_for_similar_movies`. The provided final answer accurately reflects the API data by listing two movies similar to 'After Everything (2023)	' which aligns with the user's request to identify similar movies. Thus	 **Objective 3 is a success.**""					"
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, we need to compare the required API call with the actual tool call invoked:  
- Required API call: `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `""q"": ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'""`.  
- Actual API call made by the model: `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""`.  

The tool name `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` is correct and all required arguments match. The only minor difference lies in the quotes around **""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""**; however, this has no impact on the intended query since the argument meaning is equivalent. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the final answer is missing from the log provided (`'return_type': 'give_answer'` does not appear). Instead, the model ends the inquiry process with `'Finish'`. Since no actual answer was given to fulfill the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a failure."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"The expected tool call matches the actual tool invoked by the model in terms of tool name and required arguments.  

- **Tool invoked by model**:  
  Tool name: `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database`   
  Arguments: `{""month"": 7, ""day"": 27}`  
- **Required Tool Calls**:  
  Tool name: `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database`  
  Arguments: `{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}`  

The small difference in the format of the arguments (numbers vs strings, e.g. `7` vs `""7""`), is acceptable in this context, as the semantic meaning remains consistent.  

---

**Objective 3: Success**  
*Reason*:  
The final answer directly fulfills the user's instruction and is based explicitly on the data retrieved through the API call. The list of actor URLs mentioned in the final answer corresponds exactly to the data retrieved from the tool call to `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database`.  

Final Answer:  
""Below is a list of actors and actresses born on 27th July:  
1. /name/nm0001667/  
2. /name/nm0947447/... (and others up to the full expected list).""  

By combining the behavior under Objectives 1 and 2, the model has successfully met the requirements of the task while producing a final, accurate user-centric response."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the actual tool call made by the model was `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-01T00:00:00"",
  ""end"": ""2023-05-31T23:59:59"",
  ""base"": ""USDT"",
  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
  ""accept"": ""application/json"",
  ""gran"": ""1d"",
  ""sort"": ""asc""
}
```
The required API call specified the tool `'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
  ""base"": ""USDT"",
  ""symbol"": ""BTC""
}
```

The tool names do not match (even taking truncation or similarity rules into account), which is the first reason for failure. Additionally, the arguments between the two calls differ significantly:
- The required ""start"" time is `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`, while the actual call uses `""2023-05-01T00:00:00`"".
- The required call provides no ""end"" argument, but this is present in the actual call with a value of `""2023-05-31T23:59:59""`.
In total, this leads to incorrect results for tool invocation matching and consistency, making Objective 2 a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore:
- While the model did provide a final answer containing the BTC/USDT historical price data for May on the Binance exchange with certain details, attainment of desired results cannot rely on data retrieved from incorrect tool calls."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,6,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2**:   
  The **required API calls**  are:  
  1. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{ ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  2. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{ ""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  3. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{ ""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  
  The **actual tool calls** are:  
  1. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{ ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  2. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{ ""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  3. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{ ""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  
  The tool name and arguments match exactly or semantically closely. The presence of argument whitespace differences does not affect the correctness. Therefore, the model's invoked tools completely match the required tool calls.

- **For Objective 3**:  
  The final answer successfully summarizes the derivatives at each computation. The response accounts for all API results in sequence:  
  - First derivative: \(15x^4 + 8x^3\) was derived directly after the first API call.  
  - Second derivative: \(60x^3 + 24x^2\) was correctly obtained after the second API call.  
  - Third derivative: \(180x^2 + 48x\) was calculated through the final differentiation.  

  The provided final answer follows directly from the tool responses and fulfills the user's instruction of differentiating the initial expression multiple times. The model explicitly used the data retrieved from the API calls to form its conclusion, so this is a success."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"The model invoked the following actual tool calls:  
- `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`
- `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`  

The required API calls are as follows:  
- `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`
- `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`  

The tool names match except that one is capitalized ('Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' vs 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'), but this is clearly a minor stylistic variance, so it is acceptable. Additionally, for both tool calls, the arguments in the actual call fully align with those in the required calls. Hence, the result for Objective 2 is **Success**.  

---

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:**  
The model provided the final answer:  
- `""The first-order derivative of the expression (a) $3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1$ with respect to `a` is $15*a^4 + 8*a^3$. The first-order derivative of the expression (b) $5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3$ with respect to `b` is $15*b^2 + 8*b$. I hope this helps with your practice!""`  

This final answer directly corresponds to the information retrieved using the two tool calls (responses):  
- Tool response for expression (a): `""8*a^3 + 15*a^4""`  
- Tool response for expression (b): `""8*b + 15*b^2""`  

The expressions in the final answer are correctly presented as per the results from the differentiation process as retrieved by the tool. Therefore, the model's final response successfully fulfills the user's instruction, meaning the result for Objective 3 is **Success**."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2**: The required API call is:  
- `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with arguments `{ ""city"": ""London"" }`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `list_of_cities_in_one_country_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with arguments `{}`.  
2. `get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with arguments `{""lat"":51,""lon"":-0.1,""lang"":""en""}`.  
3. `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with arguments `{}`.  
4. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

Although the model invoked the required API (`search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days`), it did not provide the required argument `{ ""city"": ""London"" }`. It instead invoked the tool with an empty argument `{}`. This mismatch in argument values leads to Objective 2 being a failure.  

**Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. As described in the interaction, the retrieved responses and the model?™s attempts could not achieve the user's instruction to get a 14-day weather forecast specific to London. The model ultimately abandoned the task. Furthermore, the model?™s final response reflects a conclusion to give up instead of answering the user's request."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  - **Tools Invoked by the Model**:  
    ```json
    {
      'name': 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2', 
      'arguments': '{""username"":""KingJames""}'

      'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""KingJames""\n  }'
    }
    ```
  After comparing the tool name and arguments, we can confirm that they are correct and align with the required API call. The additional formatting difference in the JSON (newline and spacing) does not affect correctness. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Despite correctly invoking the API tool, the final answer provided does not fulfill the user's instruction to offer more detailed information about ""KingJames"" from the Twitter profile. The final answer is garbled and contains incoherent textual data not derived from the description or relevant data retrieved by the API. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
