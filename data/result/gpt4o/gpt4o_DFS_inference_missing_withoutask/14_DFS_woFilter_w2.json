This intermediate state suggests that at some stage, attempts were made previously but resulted in failure. Earlier, the action to give up and restart has already been taken as a choice but did not produce a useful response. To adhere to the instructions, my next action should explore an alternative approach, not repeating what has already been done.\n\nMoving forward, I would investigate approaching the issue pragmatically by deducing carrier details or requesting the necessary key information.\n\nActionable Request to Solve the User's Query:\n\"Could you please provide me with the tracking number of your package? This number is required to help me detect the carrier responsible for shipping your package.\"",
