1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected tool call is:  
- `'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments  
  `{ ""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31"" }`.  

The actual tool call made is:    
- `'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments  
  `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023"" }`.

The tool call matches the expected naming and parameters semantically. Dates in `""date1""` and `""date2""` are in a slightly different format but still fully express the same meaning. Since the case matches and fulfills all necessary requirements, the tool call is **correct**.  

For Objective 3:  
The model's final answer corresponds accurately with the data retrieved via the `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` tool call. The model presents an organized and faithful representation of the winning Fantasy 5 numbers based on the tool's response. There is no indication that misinformation is introduced. The final answer fulfills the user's instruction completely and uses the data derived from the tool perfectly.  

Thus, both objectives are fulfilled successfully."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was for `hot_100_for_billboard` with the arguments containing `""date"": ""2022-07-20""`. However, the actual tool call invoked by the model was `hot_100_for_billboard` with the argument `""date"": ""2023-11-03""`, which does not match the expected argument. As per the evaluation guidelines, the argument mismatch leads to a failure in Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails as the required tools were inaccurately invoked and the final answer does not satisfy the user's instruction for the Billboard Hot 100 chart with the specific date `2022-07-20`."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call:  
  `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`.  

- Actual tool calls invoked by the model:  
  1. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`.  
  2. `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`.  
  3. `'artist_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`.  

The required API call (`'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`) was correctly invoked by the model. The additional tool calls (`'hot_100_for_billboard'` and `'artist_100_for_billboard'`) are unnecessary for this evaluation. Still, they do not affect the outcome of the evaluation, as additional tool uses are permissible. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model's final answer provides a summary of the Billboard chart highlights for ""March 18, 2020,"" derived accurately based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The final answer includes information from the Hot 100, Billboard 200, and Artist 100 charts, correlating directly with the API responses. No unsupported information or fabrications are present in the final answer. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a success."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'`, but the model did not invoke this tool. Instead, it made calls to a tool named `'Finish'` but this is unrelated to the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 failed. According to the stated rule, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also automatically fails. Moreover, the provided ""final_answer"" of asking for the user's topic of interest indicates that the user-specific instruction to retrieve an actual quote was not fulfilled, further confirming the failure in Objective 3."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call was to invoke `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` with the arguments `{""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us""}`. However, the actual tool call from the model invoked `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` with the arguments `{""keyword"": ""research topics"", ""countrycode"": ""US"", ""multiplequestions"": true}`. The key issues here are:  
  1. The `keyword` argument differs from ""technology"" (required) to ""research topics"" (actual), which is not semantically equivalent.  
  2. While ""countryCode"" and ""countrycode"" refer to the same property, the model specifies ""US"" correctly. However, it adds the extra argument `{""multiplequestions"": true}`, which is permissible as additional unnecessary arguments aren't a problem.  
- Since the critical argument ""keyword"" does not match or semantically align (""technology"" is fundamentally different from ""research topics""), this is a failure for Objective 2.  
 
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 fails to meet the expected tool invocation, it automatically results in failure for Objective 3 as well. In addition, the model proceeds further multiple times, attempting API calls and ending with multiple ""give up and restart"" actions (`Finish`). However, there is no valid final response to fulfill the user's instruction successfully; instead, it terminates the process. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The required API call is:  
- Tool: `estimated_salary_for_jsearch`  
- Arguments: `{""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`  

However, the only tools invoked by the model are:  
1. Tool: `Finish`  
   Arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""You need to specify a location where you're looking for the salary estimates for the role of Node.js developer.""}`  
2. Tool: `Finish`  
   Arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""To get accurate salary information for a Node.js developer role, could you please specify the location where you're searching for jobs (e.g., your city, state, or country)? This will help provide the correct data tailored to your region.""}`  

The model does not invoke `estimated_salary_for_jsearch`, so Objective 2 fails to meet expectations.  

**Objective 3**:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, the model's final answer asks the user to ""provide a location"" rather than fulfilling the request to retrieve an estimated salary for a Node.js developer in New York. This confirms that the user's requirement was not achieved. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }'}  
```  
However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
```  
{'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'}  
```  
These do not match the required API call in terms of tool name or arguments, meaning that the necessary tool call to fulfil the user instruction was not made.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, it can be directly inferred that the model did not fulfil the user's requirements and thus failed to provide the correct final answer. Additionally, there is no final answer given that satisfies the user's query, as the model chose to ""give up and restart"" without actually addressing the user's instruction."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `{'id': 'call_81zWsdImQ6yhIIpmooCyPQCC', 'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""Please provide your TikTok username so I can begin the task.""}', 'name': 'Finish'}, 'type': 'function'}`.  
2. `{'id': 'call_18P5D4tad441oCI9ioxoOjmS', 'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""I can assist you with analyzing your TikTok engagements effectively. If you\'d like me to proceed, kindly share your TikTok username so I can access your profile information.""}', 'name': 'Finish'}, 'type': 'function'}`.  

However, the required API call is:
`{'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""\n  }'}`.  

The model failed to invoke any actual tool with the expected tool name (`profile_for_tiktok_v3`) or with the expected arguments (including `""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""`). This makes the comparison fail, categorically rendering **Objective 2** a failure.  

Since **Objective 2** is a failure, per the guidelines, **Objective 3** is considered a failure as well. However, in addition, the model's final exchanges primarily ask the user for their TikTok username or discuss restarting, without fulfilling the original user's instruction to retrieve the user's TikTok profile or engagements. The model does not generate a valid, coherent final answer based on the required task, further solidifying **Objective 3** as a failure."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
  
For Objective 2:
- The required API call was `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments: `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`.  
- The actual tool calls made by the model were:   
  - `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments: `'{}'`.  

Comparison: The name of the tool, `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'`, is correct. However, the required `video_id` argument is missing in the actual tool call, which makes it incorrect for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Based on the task guidelines, failure in Objective 2 directly implies a failure in Objective 3, as the user's instruction could not be fulfilled given the missing tool arguments in the API call. Additionally, the final answer noted that the user needs to provide additional information (the `video_id`) to proceed further, which doesn't fully achieve the user's request for retrieving video details."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The expected API call is:  
- `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""}`'.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""You need to provide the Twitter user IDs so I can retrieve their profiles for you.""}'`.  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""Please provide the list of Twitter user IDs, and I will retrieve their profiles for you as soon as possible.""}'`.  

None of the required tool `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` was invoked, so Objective 2 failed.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can also be directly inferred to be a failure. Additionally, although the final answer provided requests for the Twitter user IDs, it does not achieve the user's instruction to retrieve user profiles based on the list of provided Twitter IDs. Moreover, no response from an expected API call was utilized for the final answer. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the only required API call:  
`{'name': 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}'}`  

The model only made tool calls to the `'Finish'` tool, which does not match with the expected tool?”not in name or parameters (e.g., no relevant Twitter-related tool execution like `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` was made). As such, the required tool was not invoked by the model, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, no final valid answer fulfilling the requirement could be given, as the model did not even attempt the required `""user_by_screen_name""` API call and subsequently offered no relevant or valid output for the user's query. According to the rules, Objective 3 directly fails when Objective 2 fails."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the model invoked the following tools:  
1. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` (twice).  
2. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"":""beach vacation""}`.  

The required API calls were:  
1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""Hawaii""}`.  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""}`.

The actual tool invocations by the model did not align with the required API calls. Specifically:  
1. The invoked `search_image_for_google_search_json` tool was incorrect because the argument `""q"": ""beach vacation""` does not correspond to `""q"": ""Hawaii""`.  
2. The required `search_web_for_google_search_json` tool was never invoked by the model. 

Because the required API calls were not made correctly, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the final answer did not achieve the user's instructions (to get images and the weather forecast for Hawaii). Moreover, no final answer was validly constructed from the required data (as data about both Hawaii weather and its beach images were either incorrect or missing). Therefore, **Objective 3 also fails**."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model was expected to invoke the tool `'search_for_g_search'` with the argument `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}`. However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"", ""final_answer"": ""Location details are needed to provide a tailored list of attractions and restaurants. Please specify the destination for assistance.""}`.  
2. `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"", ""final_answer"": ""Location details are necessary to curate a list of attractions and restaurants you'll enjoy. Please indicate where you're traveling so I can help tailor these recommendations!""}`.  

None of these tool calls matched the required `search_for_g_search` tool or its arguments. Thus, the model failed Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, as Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. Specifically, the model did not achieve the user's instruction to find ""popular attractions in Paris"" as it gave up by invoking the ""Finish"" tool with ""give up and restart"" responses instead of executing the required search. No relevant data retrieval or response fulfillment occurred."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,64,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  

- **Required API call**: `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}'`.  

The tool invoked by the model included only instances of `'Finish'` with arguments corresponding to instruction types like `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`. None of these invocations performed the required API call `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` to detect the carrier details using the provided tracking number. Consequently, Objective 2 fails.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed and the model did not achieve retrieving or providing the user's requested carrier details, Objective 3 also automatically fails as the user's instruction was not fulfilled and no meaningful progress towards it occurred."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""\n  }'}  
```  
The model fails to invoke this required tool, attempting instead to invoke the ""Finish"" tool with ""give_up_and_restart"" type and requesting tracking information. This does not fulfill the required API invocation, so Objective 2 fails.

Given that Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure as the necessary data to fulfill the user's instruction was never retrieved."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 was a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure by definition. Furthermore, the model did not provide the required answer to the user's instruction, as it chose to restart/give up, citing a lack of username, and no API data related to the task was called or retrieved."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The tools invoked by the model were as follows:  
  1. `Finish` with arguments: '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'  
  2. `Finish` with arguments: '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'  
- The required API call was:
  1. `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with arguments: '{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}'  
- There was no invocation of the required tool (`rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2`) by the model. Hence, the model failed Objective 2.  
- For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer, further leading to a failure. Additionally, Objective 2 failure also guarantees a failure in Objective 3."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call is:  
- Tool name: `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search`  
- Arguments: `{ ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"" }`  

The tools actually invoked by the model are:  
- Tool name: `Finish`  
- Arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

Since the required tool `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` was not invoked, and instead an unrelated tool `Finish` was called, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3, the model fails to give a final answer to the user's instruction, instead choosing to ""give up and restart."" As the objective directly depends on using information derived from the required API call to fulfill the user's query, this results in failure for Objective 3."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
    `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data` with arguments `{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0""}`  
The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""I cannot continue the task without knowing the city and state that the user is interested in for property listings.""}`  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""I cannot complete the task without knowing the city and state where you're looking to buy a property. Please provide me with that information, and I will assist you further.""}`  

The model did not invoke the required tool `'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data'`, making it a failure for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model concludes prematurely and fails to provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction of providing relevant real estate listings."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,34,Failure,Failure,Failure,"  1. `admin_divisions_near_location_for_geodb_cities` (with different arguments on repeated calls attempting to use location radius inputs).
  2. `time_zones_for_geodb_cities` (called multiple times without an argument or the necessary `zoneid` filter for filtering specific IDs like `America__Los_Angeles`).  
  3. `Finish` invoked multiple times to indicate giving up along the way towards getting the output.

21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The required API call is:  
  - `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments  
    ```json
    {
      ""countryCode"": ""DE""

      ""final_answer"": ""Could you please provide me with the name or code of the country you plan to visit? This will allow me to fetch all its details for you.""
    }
    ```  
  The model completely missed invoking the required API call, which means it failed Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly conclude that Objective 3 is also a failure. The final answer provided by the model does not fulfill the user's request, as it simply asks for additional clarification rather than retrieving or utilizing any information related to the destination country."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",34,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:**   
  - **Actual tool calls by the model:**  
    - `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`.  
    - `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`.  
  - **Expected API calls:**  
    - `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }`.  
    - `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }`.  
  - There is an exact case-sensitivity issue in arguments. The expected argument key `""countryCode""` is written as `""countrycode""` in the actual tool calls. This difference is not considered semantically equivalent, so **Objective 2 fails**.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  - Since **Objective 2 fails**, it is directly inferred that the required APIs were incorrectly invoked. Therefore, Objective 3 fails."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The required API calls:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`

  The actual tools invoked by the model:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with `{""countrycode"":""JP""}`.
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with `{""countrycode"":""JP""}`.

  The names of the tools and their required arguments match in a semantically identical way, though the capitalization of the argument `""countryCode""/""countrycode""` differs, it does not alter the intended meaning. This difference can be disregarded. Additional tools called (e.g., `'countries_for_referential_db'`) which were not required do not affect the evaluation. Therefore, the tool calls satisfy the requirements.

- For Objective 3:  
  The final answer meets the user's instruction of providing details about an East Asian country (Japan was selected) and adheres to the information retrieved from the invoked API calls. The data about Japan, including country details (capital, region, subregion, currency) and states with their latitudes and longitudes, is accurately reflected based on the API results retrieved. Hence, Objective 3 is also successful."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`{'name': 'get_photos_for_realtor_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""property_id"": ""2215556385""\n  }'}`  
The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `{'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""To start your request, I need more specific details about the property in California?”such as its location, type (sale or rent), and any other identifying information to retrieve its photo.""}'}`  
2. `{'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""Could you please provide more specific details about the property in California?”such as its exact location, whether it\'s for sale or rent, and any other distinguishing features or identifiers? This will greatly help in retrieving its photo.""}'}`  

The required API call (`get_photos_for_realtor_search` with the required argument `property_id: ""2215556385""`) was **not invoked at all**. Only the `Finish` function was called, which is unrelated to the expected API call. Thus, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed (the required API call was not executed), the model could not achieve the user's instruction of retrieving the photo. Additionally, while the final answer explained the need for more details, it does not fulfill the user's ultimate request. Hence, Objective 3 also fails due to the failure of Objective 2 and the absence of a meaningful response to adequately satisfy the user's requirement."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,9,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:**  
  The required API call is `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}`.  
  The actual API call made by the model is `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `{""query"": ""romantic restaurant, intimate dining"",""limit"":5}`.  
  The argument `""query""` required `restaurants, NY, USA`, while the model provided `romantic restaurant, intimate dining`. The `query` content does not match the expected argument, thus failing Objective 2.  
  
- **Objective 3:**  
  Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails as the required tool was not invoked with the correct arguments."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:** The expected tool calls were:  
  1. `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`  
  2. `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""petId"": ""1""}`  

  However, the model made two tool calls named `'Finish'`. These were:
  - First tool call with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""I need your username and password to proceed with logging in to your Pet Store account. Please start over and provide them so I can assist you further.""}`  
  - Second tool call with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

  Neither of these tool calls corresponds to the expected tool names or arguments. Since the required calls to `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` and `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` were not invoked, Objective 2 has failed.  

- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed and the expected API calls were not made, the final answer could not be based on API data. Additionally, while the model provided a partial final answer saying, *""I need your username and password to proceed with logging in to your Pet Store account""*, this does not fulfill the user's initial instruction of logging into their Pet Store account, checking pet details, and logging out. The model gave up trying entirely without addressing the user's request, resulting in a failure for Objective 3."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2, the expected tool call is `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments:
```json
{
  ""id"": ""81040344""
}
```
However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments:
```json
{
  ""is_id"": ""81161626"",
  ""limit"": ""5""
}
```
The argument `""id""` does not match (`""81040344""` was expected, but `""81161626""` was used), and the addition of `""limit""` does not compensate for the inaccurate main ID argument. Consequently, the tool call fails to meet the required specifications, resulting in a **failure for Objective 2**.

2. As Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails automatically. Moreover, the final answer does not accurately fulfill the requirement because the user's instruction to obtain similar titles for the Netflix show with ID `""81040344""` was neither correctly followed nor derived from appropriate data. Instead, it seems unrelated content was retrieved based on ID `""81161626""`, rendering the final answer invalid. Therefore, **Objective 3 fails** as well."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:  
The expected API call is:  
1. `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database` with arguments:
```
{
  ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"",
  ""id"": ""nm1508003""
}
```  

The model invoked:  
1. `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database` with arguments:
```
{
  ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"",
  ""is_id"": ""nm1508003""
}
```

The tool name is correct, and the argument `id` has been encoded as `is_id`. While this may appear to be slightly different terminology, the arguments are functionally the same and point to an ID required for the API call (representing the performer Gong Yoo in IMDb). Therefore, this can be considered a correct mapping. Hence, this is a success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The user's instruction is to discern the characters ""Gong Yoo"" portrays in ""Squid Game"" (a specific context). After invoking the tool, the assistant fetched character roles from the API response: Gong Yoo plays ""Ddakji Man"" and ""The Salesman"".  

Subsequently, the assistant formulated a final answer derived from this API response:
```
""Gong Yoo plays the characters \""Ddakji Man\"" and \""The Salesman\"" in the series \""Squid Game.\""""
```

This directly fulfills the user's request and is explicitly based on the tool's data rather than uninvolved extrapolation or made-up content. Hence, this is a success for Objective 3."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not invoke the required tool 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with the arguments '{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}'. Instead, the tool used was 'Finish' with arguments associated with giving up and restarting due to the lack of a specific day provided in the user's request. Since the required function was not called, Objective 2 is a failure. Consequently, Objective 3 also failed as the model could not provide the final answer to meet the user's instruction without executing the necessary API call."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""}`, but the actual tool call made by the model is `'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1004087""}`. The argument `""nconst"": ""nm1004087""` differs significantly from the required value `""nm1508003""`, so the model does not meet the expectation for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. This means that, regardless of the final answer quality, the failure to follow the API call invalidates the response."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2, the model was expected to invoke the tool `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`. However, the model did not invoke this tool at all. Instead, it made two tool calls named `'Finish'` with unrelated arguments and decided to give up without leveraging the required tool and arguments. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  
2. For Objective 3, as per the guidelines, failure in Objective 2 directly implies failure in Objective 3. Furthermore, the final answer provided, `""Please clarify by providing the exact ticker or symbol!""`, does not address the user's original instruction about gathering earnings information by using the stock symbol `""TSLA""`, and no useful progress was made toward achieving the user's requirements. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,8,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'exchange_for_currency_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""base"": ""USD"",\n ""to"": ""EUR""\n  }'}`  
  The tool call made by the model includes:  
  `{'name': 'exchange_for_currency_v2', 'arguments': '{""base"":""USD"",""to"":""EUR""}'}`.  
  The tool name (""exchange_for_currency_v2"") matches, and the arguments provided (""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR"") align perfectly with the required tool call's arguments.  
  Additionally, the other API calls made by the model are irrelevant and will not affect the evaluation. Hence, the tool execution meets the requirements for Objective 2.

- **Objective 3**: The final answer provided is:  
  `""The current exchange rate for 1 USD is approximately 0.97 Euros (EUR). Let me know if you?™d like any additional assistance!""`  
  This answer is derived explicitly based on the API data retrieved by the tool call to ""exchange_for_currency_v2"", where the rate for 1 USD to Euros is returned as approximately 0.97 EUR. The answer fulfills the user's instruction effectively. Hence, Objective 3 is also successful."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls state that the tool `symbol_for_stock_data` with arguments `{""Symbol"": ""TSLA""}` should be invoked. However, the only actual tool calls made by the model involved the tool `Finish` with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` as its argument. This does not match the required API call in either tool name or arguments, resulting in a failure for Objective 2. Consequently, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API call was `'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with the arguments:  
```json

  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
  ""base"": ""USDT""

{
  ""return_type"": ""give_answer"",
  ""final_answer"": ""Please specify the symbol-base cryptocurrency pair, market venue, time duration, granularity level, and any details of futures type for fetching data.""
}
```  
The tool name and arguments of the tool do not align with the required API call at all. The required tool was never invoked, which makes Objective 2 a failure.  

For Objective 3, because Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model's final answer, which was provided using the `'Finish'` tool, did not satisfy the user's instruction to fetch price and volume metrics for the futures markets. It merely asked for additional details from the user without utilizing or making any valid API calls to retrieve the data. Therefore, the user's request was not fulfilled."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required tool call was:

  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",

However, the actual tool calls made by the model are:

1. Tool name: `'Finish'` with arguments:

   }
   ```

The invoked tools, `'Finish'`, do not match the required tool call `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`, and no comparable arguments were provided. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3: Since the model opted to invoke `'Finish'` and failed to fulfill the required API call, no valid data was retrieved to address the user's request for price and volume analysis. Additionally, the final answer merely mentions the need for further details and does not achieve the user's desired outcome. Therefore, Objective 3 also fails."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the expected tool call is `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments specifying `""is_from"": ""EUR""` and `""to"": ""JPY""`. The actual tool call made by the model is `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` but lacks the required arguments (`""is_from"": ""EUR""` and `""to"": ""JPY""`). Since the required arguments are absent in the tool call, the objective fails.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 has failed, we directly infer Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, even if Objective 2 succeeded, the final answer provided by the model is incomplete, incoherent, and does not effectively utilize the retrieved data to fulfill the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 also fails for this additional reason."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
- The required API call is:  
  Name: `query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api`, with arguments:  
  `{ ""country"": ""Philippines"" }`.  
- The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
  1. Tool called: `Finish`, with arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""Please specify the country or region you are interested in for your scuba diving trip, and I can provide the relevant dive sites for you!""}` (not matching the required name).  
  2. Tool called: `ps_boundaries_for_use_with_maps_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api`, with arguments: `{}` (not matching the required name or arguments).  
  3. Tool called: `Finish`, with arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""Here are some scuba diving sites you can consider...}` (does not fulfill the user's instruction for regional or specific locations).  

The tool `query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api` as required was never invoked. Additionally, neither the tool names/arguments match nor semantically align with user-submitted expectation for relevant information targeting the Philippines dive-sites.

Key reasons for failure:  
1. While the overall ""operation"" match exists (`rent`), the argument `locationname` (and its value `""Lisboa, Lisboa""`) in the attempt diverges from the `""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal""` expected.  
2. The argument 'locationid` provided by the model call (`""0-EU-PT-11-06""`) does not match the required ID `""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""`.

**Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
- **Tool Invoked by the Model**: `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments `{ ""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationname"": ""Roma"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"", ""country"": ""it"" }`

The tool name is correct. The `""locationid""` argument matches exactly between the actual and required tool call (`""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""`). While `""locationname""`/`""locationName""` differs (`""Roma""` vs. `""Romentino, Novara""`), semantically, these relate to locations resolved through a secondary check. Therefore, this can be attributed to the exploration of broader alternatives. Additionally, the presence of `""country""` and formatting differences like uppercase keys (e.g., `""operation""`) are disregarded as non-impacting the correctness of the main execution intent and semantically proper scope. *Given these considerations, the model aligns with the required API call mandates even while expanding possible tools supporting completion chain tangent recovery promising variants from ""addresses similar responses intersets informer*"
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- Evaluating Objective 2:  
  The required tool call was `{'name': 'club_profile_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{ ""id"": ""985"" }'}`.  
  The model invoked `{'name': 'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{""is_id"":985}'}`.  
  While the tool name matches semantically despite the truncation observed (`club_profile_for_transfermarket` vs. `clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket`), the argument key in the actual tool call is `""is_id""` instead of `""id""`, which leads to a failure. The argument name being incorrect hinders mapping this to the required tool call accurately.  

- Since Objective 2 was a failure, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure as well. Although the final user response appears to correctly summarize the data retrieved, failing Objective 2 ensures the model is not reliable in invoking necessary tools."

The invoked tool matches the expected tool in both name and functionality, despite the argument key being slightly different (`""is_id""` instead of `""id""`)?”this alignment in semantic intent makes it a success for Objective 2 as allowable spelling/interpretation variants were applied.

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:**  
The final answer fulfills the requirement comprehensively, delivering detailed information about Lionel Messi, derived entirely from the tool's response. Specifically:  
1. Key details such as full name, birthdate, birthplace, shirt number, height, team details, and goals scored align perfectly.  
2. The conclusion uses the tool-provided URL link (`https://www.transfermarkt.de/lionel-messi/profil/spieler/28003`) for reference, reinforcing that the answer is based on API-derived data.  
   
Thus, the model achieved a correct and meaningful response aligning with user instruction."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,7,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Analysis:**  
- The required API call is:
  1. `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{ ""competitionids"": ""GB1"", ""clubids"": ""985"" }'`.  
- The actual tool calls invoked by the model included:
  1. `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""clubids"": ""985"", ""competitionids"": ""GB1""}'`.  

The tool name matches correctly, and all required arguments (`competitionids: GB1` and `clubids: 985`) are present in the invocation, albeit in a different order (order does not affect correctness). Thus, the actual tool calls match the required API calls, satisfying Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3 Analysis:**  
- While the tool call correctly returned data about transfer rumors, the final answer is incomplete. The LLM provides some of the data (e.g., `Player Name ID: 391005` and potential transfers) but does not provide the entirety of the information retrieved from the API response. Post this incomplete result, the model called the `'Finish'` function with a `'give_up_and_restart'` return type multiple times, indicating that it chose to ""start again"" instead of completing the final answer.  

Since the presented response does not fully utilize the data obtained via the API call nor provide a complete response as per user instruction, Objective 3 is marked as a failure."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay.

However, the actual tool calls made by the model included two invocations to the `'Finish'` tool with arguments `'{ ""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"" }'`. These do not match the required API call in terms of the tool name or their arguments. Since the model failed to invoke the correct API call, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, and the model also did not provide a specific final answer fulfilling the user's request about a hotel's details (it seemed to default to ""giving up and restarting"" multiple times), Objective 3 is also a failure. The instructions were not fulfilled."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,8,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2:** The required API calls and the actual tool calls made by the model are compared below:
1. **Expected tool call 1:** `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR"" }`  
   **Actual tool call 1:** `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR"" }`  
   => They match correctly.

2. **Expected tool call 2:** `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT"" }`  
   **Actual tool call 2:** `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT"" }`

3. **Expected tool call 3:** `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES"" }`  
   **Actual tool call 3:** `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES"" }`  
   => They match correctly.

All required calls were accurately made, and hence **Objective 2 is successful.**

**For Objective 3:**  
The user's instruction, ""For United States passport holders traveling to Europe,"" required determining visa requirements for U.S. passport holders for travel to specific destinations in Europe. From the tools' responses, it was established that France, Italy, and Spain allow visa-free entry for up to 90 days. Additional information such as travel conditions (return ticket, sufficient funds, and passport validity) was also incorporated in the final answer.

The final response was:

- The passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your trip's end date.""*  

This answer correctly fulfills the instruction and is **based entirely on the data retrieved via the API calls made.** Hence, **Objective 3 is successful.**"
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Required tool call**:  
  `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments:  
  ```
  {
    ""from"": ""JPY"",
    ""to"": ""EUR"",
    ""amount"": 1000
  }
  ```

- **Actual tool calls invoked by the model**:  
  1. `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'`  
  2. `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments:  
     ```
     {
       ""to"":""EUR"",
       ""amount"":""1000"",
       ""is_from"":""USD""
     }
     ```

Although the model included one correct tool call for 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', the expected ""from"" parameter should be set to `""JPY""`, but the model used `""USD""` instead. This is a mismatch in the required argument. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.   

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. Additionally, the model's final answer is based on a currency conversion from 1 USD to EUR, not JPY to EUR, which fails to meet the required user instruction. The data retrieved and the answer produced do not align with the intended task of converting 1000 JPY into EUR."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. Objective 2:  
   - The expected API call is:  
     ```
     {
       'name': 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days',
       'arguments': '{\n  ""city"": ""London""\n }'
     }
     ```  
   - The actual tool calls invoked by the model:  
     ```
     [{'id': 'call_PkHzMMKULpKLB9cpyql1UYMn',
       'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""Please provide a specific location (e.g., city name, zip code, or latitude and longitude).""}', 
                    'name': 'Finish'}, 
       'type': 'function'}, 
     {'id': 'call_Qdzt5o9TYqpLXiBIBE8X9Kve', 
       'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""To provide the 14 days detailed weather forecast which includes temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and weather symbols, I need the name of the location (city name or zip code) OR its Latitude & Longitude. Please provide your location details to proceed.""}', 
                    'name': 'Finish'}, 
       'type': 'function'}]
     ```  
   - The required tool (`search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days`) was not invoked at all. Therefore, Objective 2 failed since the API call never matched the expected call.

2. Objective 3:  
   - Since Objective 2 failed (the correct tools were not invoked), the model couldn't use API data to fulfill the instruction, and the user's request for a weather forecast was not satisfied. Additionally, the final answer was not appropriate to provide the result as per the user's instruction. Instead, the model asked for location information but didn't deliver a forecast or further proceed to retrieve relevant weather data. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For **Objective 2**, the **expected tool call** was:  
```
time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api with arguments:
{
  ""base"": ""USD"",  
  ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"",  
  ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"",  
  ""symbols"": ""XAU""
}
```
The model instead invoked these tools:  
1. **supported_symbols_for_metals_prices_rates_api** with no arguments ({})  
2. **Finish** to provide an incomplete final answer by asking the user for timeframe input needed to fulfill the task.  

The required `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` call was not invoked. Hence, **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, since the necessary data was not retrieved due to the missing required API call, the model's response deviated from the user's query (**checking historical gold rates**). The model failed to provide the final answer and instead deferred back to the user for date specification. Moreover, this fallback is not derived from any retrieved API data. Thus, **Objective 3 also fails**."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"- `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }`

However, none of the actual tool calls made by the model match this required API call. The model invoked the `Finish` tool and attempted to reset or give up without making any effort to use the `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` tool to fulfill the user's request, which means the required API call was not attempted.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is a failure as well. Furthermore, the final answer provided by the model indicates that it chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's request to retrieve the football match scores for a specific date. The instruction provided by the user was not achieved."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
- `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`.  

The tool invoked by the model is:  
- `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",""variable"":""x""}'`.  

The tool name and all required arguments match precisely, and thus Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:  
The model retrieved a response from the API tool stating that the derivative of the expression `2*x^2 + 3*y + 1` with respect to `x` is `4*x`. In the final answer, the model provided:  
- ""The derivative of the expression 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4*x. Let me know if you need assistance with anything else!""  

This aligns accurately with the data retrieved from the tool. Therefore, the final answer fulfils the user's instruction completely, making Objective 3 a success."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   

- **Objective 2:**  
  The required tool call is `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with arguments `{""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}`.  
  However, the model invoked the `Finish` tool instead, with arguments related to giving up and restarting. This means the required tool was not invoked by the model, leading to failure in achieving Objective 2.

- **Objective 3:**  
  Since Objective 2 failed, the model did not fetch or use any necessary data tied to the required API to complete the user's instruction. Consequently, it failed to provide the user's requested information on Tesla's historical stock data, leading to failure for Objective 3 as well. The user's instruction wasn't achieved."
