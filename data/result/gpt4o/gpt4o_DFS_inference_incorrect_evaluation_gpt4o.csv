1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the expected tool calls are as follows:  
  1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  
  2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  

  The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingnumber"":""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  
  2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingnumber"":""YT2003521266065328""}'`.  

  Although the argument name is camel-cased (`trackingnumber` instead of `trackingNumber`), the values are correctly aligned, and semantically it achieves the intended goal. Thus, we consider the tool calls valid under Objective 2. Both required API calls were invoked successfully.

- For **Objective 3**, the model provided the final answer using the retrieved data from the invoked tool calls. The information aligns with data fetched through the API responses:
  - It identified the carrier as `""Yun Express""` from the response to `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'`.
  - The final answer mentioned that no detailed tracking events were found, confirmed by data in the response to `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` (showing a status of `notfound002` with no detailed events).
  - Additionally, it accurately used the API data to provide the carrier?ôs website, `http://www.yunexpress.com/`, and contact number, `4000-2621-26`.

Thus, the final answer both fulfills the user's request and is appropriately based on the retrieved API data."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The required API calls are:  
- `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
- `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}` and `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}` (the latter matches a required call).  
2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}` (this matches the second required call).  

Both required API calls were invoked by the model with the correct tool names and arguments. Additional tool calls like the first `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` invocation do not harm the result, per the evaluation rule allowing extra but unnecessary tool calls. Therefore, **Objective 2 is successful.**  

For Objective 3: The model responded to the user's query about the tracking number, incorporating the results from `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` and `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`.  
- The final response correctly linked the tracking number ""YT2003521266065328"" to the carrier ""Yun Express."" It provided accurate information about the absence of recent tracking updates, contact details for YunExpress support, and a link to their website, all derived directly from the tool responses, proving proper usage of retrieved API data.  
- Since this adequately fulfills the user's instruction, **Objective 3 is also successful.**"
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the models' invoked API calls and the required API calls are inconsistent. Below is a detailed comparison:  

- **Required API Calls**:  
  1. `'get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store'` with arguments `'{\n  ""is_id"": ""1053012308""\n }'`  
  2. `'get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store'` with arguments `'{\n  ""is_id"": ""1053012308""\n }'`  

- **API Calls Made by the Model**:  
  1. `'get_similar_apps_for_ios_store'` with `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  
  2. `'get_ios_app_for_ios_store'` with `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  
  3. Re-attempted `'get_similar_apps_for_ios_store'` with the same incorrect arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  

The **tool name discrepancies** (`get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` vs. `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store`) are likely trivial due to naming structure/styling inconsistency. However, **the required and actual argument values differ in the is_id field**: the model used `""1053012309""` in all cases while the required argument was `""1053012308""`. This mismatch fails Objective 2.

---

For **Objective 3**, the final response did not demonstrate success in achieving the user's instructions. The model failed to fetch similar apps or app details for the provided (incorrect) `is_id`. Instead, it concluded the task as unresolved, effectively communicating its inability to achieve the user objective. Additionally, the provided final output (e.g., reporting no similar apps found or the issue with the `is_id`) hinges on faulty data caused by incorrect tool usage, directly tied to Objective 2's failure. Thus:  

Objective 3 also fails because the final answer does not fulfill the user instruction, demonstrating incomplete execution even after correctly interpreting `""is_id"": ""1053012309""`, which was due to using invalid tool inputs."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"The required tool call:  
- `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{\n  ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"",\n  ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""\n }'`.  

The actual tool call made by the model:  
- `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}'`.  

The tool name matches correctly, and the arguments match exactly, ensuring the correct and intended tool call was made. There are no discrepancies between the two.

---

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason**:  
The final answer provided by the model:  
- `""Here are the winning Fantasy 5 number sets between 01-01-2023 and 01-10-2023:\n\n1. Date: 2023-01-10 ??Numbers: 3, 6, 17, 20, 30\n2. Date: 2023-01-09 ??Numbers: 13, 21, 23, 24, 36\n3.

The answer accurately reflects the data returned from the tool call itself (as seen in the `response` from the `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` tool). The explanation provided is logically consistent and effectively fulfills the user's request to retrieve and present the Fantasy 5 drawings for the given date range."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The expected tool call is `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""}`.  
- However, the actual tool calls made by the model were:
  1. `get_addresses_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{}`  
  2. `get_quota_usage_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{}`  
  3. `Finish` with arguments providing the final answer.  
- The expected tool call (`get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor`) was not invoked. This means Objective 2 is a failure.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure regardless of the content of the final answer. The user's instruction was not achieved as the necessary expected API call was not even made."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are:  
1. `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{\n  ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""\n }'`  
2. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{\n  ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""\n }'`  

The tools invoked by the model were:  
1. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{  ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`.  

Although the second required function `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` was invoked successfully and matches our expectations, `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` was not invoked at all. The missing tool call to `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` results in **failure** for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure (not all required tool calls were invoked), the retrieved information is incomplete or potentially not derived fully from the APIs. Thus, Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, while the model provides a answer, it cannot align with all the required API data."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  - Tools Invoked by Model:  
    1. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments: `{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}`  
  - Required API Calls:  
    1. `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments: `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
    2. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments: `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
  - Analysis: The model only invoked the tool `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with the correct arguments, yet it failed to invoke the tool `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` as required. Since the output lacks one of the required API calls, it results in a failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 directly fails as the final answer cannot be considered valid without fulfilling the expected API operations."

For Objective 2:  
**Actual tool calls invoked by the model:**

2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }'`.  
3. `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }'`.  

**Expected API calls:**  
1. `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }'`.  
2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }'`.  
3. `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }'`.  

The actual tool calls match the tool names and required arguments provided in the expected calls. This makes Objective 2 a success. Additional unnecessary notes/attempts by the model do not affect Objective 2's evaluation.

For Objective 3:  
Despite multiple server errors occurring during API queries, **data retrieval from Spotify API was partially successful for the user-set identifier (""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"").** The final response synthesizes information based on tool invocations for functionality-related visualization, suggesting viable transformations without server ambigu'

1. Tool: `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` with arguments `{""channelname"":""mrbeast""}`.  
2. Tool: `channel_details_for_youtube_search` with arguments `{""channelid"":""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`.  

The required API calls are:  
1. Tool: `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` with arguments `{\n ""channelname"": ""mrbeast""\n }`.  
2. Tool: `channel_details_for_youtube_search` with arguments `{\n ""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""\n }`.  

The tool names match, and the arguments are the same semantically. Additional unnecessary tool calls (`Finish`) do not invalidate the outcome per guidance. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The final answer provided is:

The final output correctly retrieves the details such as channel name, ID, avatar, banners, and description; all of this information is clearly based on the data retrieved from the respective API calls (`youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` and `channel_details_for_youtube_search`). Therefore, the final answer fulfills the user's instruction successfully."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2:
  - The actual tool call made by the model:  
    `'validate_email_for_validate_email' with arguments '{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}'`  
  - The expected tool call required:  
    `'validate_email_for_validate_email' with arguments '{ ""email"": ""test@gmail.com"" }'`  
  - Upon comparison, the tool name and arguments match exactly. There are no errors or discrepancies in the provided actual tool call. Thus, Objective 2 is marked as a success.  

- For Objective 3:
  - The invoked tool `validate_email_for_validate_email` returned content indicating that the email `""test@gmail.com""` successfully passed all major validation checks.  
  - The final answer given by the model:  
    `""The email address 'test@gmail.com' is valid. It successfully passed all major checks, including regex validation, typo validation, disposable email test, MX record test, and SMTP test.""`  
  - The final answer aligns completely with the information from the API response retrieved. Hence, the model's response accurately fulfills the user's instruction regarding email validation, marking Objective 3 as a success."

- For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
  `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with `arguments: '{ ""date"": ""19870630"" }'`.  
  The actual tool call made by the model:  
  `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with `arguments: '{""date"": ""19870630""}'`.  
  The tool name matches accurately, and the argument, `""date"": ""19870630""`, is an exact match to the required arguments. An additional unnecessary tool call was made (`'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator'`), but its presence doesn?ôt affect the assessment for Objective 2.

  - Not all required tools were invoked.  
  - None of the required tool calls had correct arguments.  
  - Multiple unnecessary and irrelevant tool calls were made.  

### Objective 3: Failure

14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are:  
   1. `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`
   2. `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`
   
- The model invoked the following tools:  
   1. `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""playlistid"":""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"",""part"":""snippet,contentDetails""}`  
   2. `Finish`  
   3. `search_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""part"":""snippet"",""q"":""animated movies"",""order"":""relevance"",""maxresults"":10}`  

While the model invoked the `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` tool, the argument `playlistid` was not correctly aligned with the required value `RDZiQo7nAkQHU` (a mismatch was found as `ASLpZt3vCjQVX` was used instead). Additionally, the required `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` tool was not invoked at all. 

Given this, Objective 2 is a failure because not all tools were called as required, and the arguments were not accurately matched.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model eventually chose to ""give up and restart"" without producing a correct response based on the user's instructions or completing the required API calls. Without fulfilling Objective 2 correctly, the final response also fails to fulfill the user's requirements."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The tools invoked by the model are as follows:

The **expected tool calls** were:  
1. `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments: `{ ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }`  
2. `user_s_likes_for_twitter` with arguments: `{ ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }`  

Comparing the two:  
- The actual tool calls fail to use the correct `user_id`. The expected `user_id` was `""96479162""`, whereas the model used `""987654321""`.  
- Additionally, the second expected API call to `user_s_likes_for_twitter` was not even attempted.  

Thus, since all required API calls were not correctly invoked, **Objective 2 fails**.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 resulted in a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure. Further, the final answer mostly revolves around the actions taken, and no correct result is derived for the requested user ID (`96479162`). Moreover, the model mentions that it ""gave up and restarted"", which indicates that the user's instruction was not achieved."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the expected API call was `'user_details_for_twitter'` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {  
    ""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""  
  }  
  ```  
  However, the system invoked a different API call, `'search_for_twitter'`, with arguments:  
  ```json
  {  
    ""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"",  
    ""min_retweets"": 100  
  }  
  ```  
  This does not match the expected tool name or arguments, resulting in Objective 2 failing.

- For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer Objective 3 is a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model:  
  ```
  ""I searched for tweets mentioning 'XYZADRHSDFDA' with at least 100 retweets. Currently, there are no results matching this query. If you need a wider search or want to refine the parameters, let me know!""  
  ```

  2. `'check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3'` (an extra tool call not required).
  
- **Expected API calls**:
  - `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with arguments `{""search"": ""google.com""}`
  
**Evaluation**:  
The expected API `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with arguments matching `{""search"": ""google.com""}` was correctly invoked by the model. The extra API call (to `'check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3'`) does not affect the evaluation because additional unnecessary tools are allowed as per the provided evaluation criteria. Thus, objective 1 is satisfied.

**Evaluation**:  
The final answer includes the domain information for ""google.com,"" retrieved from the correct API call. The similarity check between `wikipedia.org` and `wikimedia.org` is extra information and not directly related to the user's instruction. However, the key instruction about clarifying the ""google.com"" domain information was fulfilled, making it a success in Objective 3.

**Reason**:   
**Objective 2**: The model's actual tool `""domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3""` was correctly invoked with the matching arguments. Additional tools invoked did not conflict with the requirement.  
**Objective 3**: The model effectively used the retrieved API information to generate the correct and detailed final answer that fulfilled the user's instruction."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
- `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments: `{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments: `{""date"": ""2025-06-01""}`.  
2. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments: `{""date"": ""2025-06-15""}`.  

The dates in the arguments differ, as the API calls made by the model retrieve information for `2025-06-01` and `2025-06-15` instead of `2024-06-01`, the specified date in the required API call. Since the dates do not match, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3, because Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Additionally, the final response from the model explicitly states that due to the limitation of the toolset, it cannot solve the user's question. This confirms the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with the arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`. However, the model invoked no such tool; instead, the only tool invoked was `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`. Therefore, the model failed to invoke the required tool call, leading to failure for Objective 2. 

As per the rule, when Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. Lacking a final answer also indicates that the user's requirement was not fulfilled."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
  `'name': 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""2024-02-18""\n }'`  
  The actual tool call by the model is:  
  `'name': 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', 'arguments': '{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'`.  
  Both the tool name and the required argument `""date"": ""2024-02-18""` match exactly. The format variation between single-line and multi-line JSON does not affect the meaning, making this a **perfect match**. Therefore, all required tool calls are met.  
- For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model is:  
  `""The Fear and Greed index for February 18th, 2024, was approximately 77.29. However, no specific rating is provided for this date.""`  
  This response aligns with the data obtained from the tool (`{'fear': 77.28571, 'rating': None}`), rounding the fear value as `77.29` and explaining that no specific rating is provided as per the API's response. Additionally, the user's instruction?îto confirm or gather information for February 18th, 2024?îhas been properly addressed here. The output relies on the tool call entirely and delivers accurate information, fulfilling the user's request."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025?

Since the correct API call was not made, Objective 2 has failed. As per evaluation rules, because Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. The final answer also does not address the user's instruction or achieve their goal."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the model was expected to invoke the following APIs with their respective arguments:  
1. `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with arguments: `""is_id"": ""80057281""`  
2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments: `""ids"": ""80057281""`  

However, the model invoked the following APIs:  
1. `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with arguments: `""is_id"": ""90068472""`.  

The `is_id` argument in the actual API invocation is different from the required argument (`80057281`). Furthermore, the second required tool `title_details_for_netflix_data` was not invoked at all. Due to these mismatches, **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, since the failure in **Objective 2** means there were missing or incorrect API invocations, the model could not retrieve the necessary information to accurately fulfill the user's request. Although the model concludes with a final answer that no trailer is available (`final_answer`), this conclusion is invalid as the required tools were not correctly invoked to verify this claim. Additionally, the final answer is based on an invalid API response from an incorrectly invoked tool (`is_id` mismatch). Therefore, **Objective 3 also fails**."
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472. Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls outlined in the task were as follows:  
1. **Required APIs**:  
   - Tool Name: `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with Arguments: `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}`
   - Tool Name: `title_details_for_netflix_data` with Arguments: `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`  

   The tools actually invoked by the model were:  
   - Tool Name: `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with Arguments: `{""is_id"": ""90068472"",""limit"":""25""}`
   - Tool Name: `title_details_for_netflix_data` with Arguments: `{""ids"":""90068472""}`  

   Comparing the required API calls against the actual calls:  
   - The `is_id` value in the first tool call is expected to be ""80057281"", but ""90068472"" was used instead.  
   - The `ids` value for the second tool is also incorrect, as the expected value was ""80057281"" but ""90068472"" was used.  

   This mismatch in arguments makes the invocation of both required tools incorrect. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 was a failure, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure as well. Furthermore, the model did not provide a meaningful final answer that resolved the user's instruction as it admitted to unsuccessfully fulfilling the task and ultimately ended the session via the ""Finish"" tool action. This confirms the user's requirement was not achieved."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  

- For Objective 2:  
  The actual tools invoked by the model were:  
  1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}`  
  2. `'Finish'` with arguments for the final answer construction.  

  The expected API calls were:  
  1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  
  2. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

The first tool (`domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`) was invoked, but with an entirely different argument (`""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""` instead of `""getecz.com""`). Additionally, the second expected tool (`loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`) was not invoked at all. Therefore, the API calls made do not match the required calls in parameters or coverage. **Objective 2 is therefore a failure.**

- For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 can *directly* be classified as a failure. Moreover:  
  - The final answer (`""The domain `ourbusinessplatform123124.net` appears to not yet exist or is not registered...""`) does not resolve the user's original need since (**given in the required API calls**) the intended domain to query was `""getecz.com""`. Furthermore, the final answer is unrelated to the results of the specific API calls expected. This further ensures Objective 3 is a failure as well."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",31,8,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- **Expected Tool Calls:**
  1. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`
  2. `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`

- **Actual Tool Calls Made by the Model:**
  1. The model invoked `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}` multiple times at different points, which satisfies the first required API call.  
  2. The model invoked `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`, which satisfies the second required API call.  

As such, all expected tool calls are present and were made accurately, fulfilling the requirements. Hence, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For Objective 3:
- The task requires producing meaningful and actionable insights based on data retrieved from the API calls.  
- While tool calls were performed, the model failed to provide a solid conclusion or final answer to fulfill the given instruction. Instead, it repeatedly asked questions, raised observational remarks due to redirects, and attempted restarting with different formats or datasets.  
- Despite sufficient data related to ""getecz.com,"" the tool never consolidated the data or provided final actionable insights based on it, maladaptively focusing instead on errors and retries.  

Hence, the final answer failed to achieve the user's requirement of meaningful analysis or deliverables using the gathered API data. As the final produced output remained unresolved or incomplete, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"  The model invoked:  
  - `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",""variable"":""x""}`  

- **Expected tool calls:**  
  - `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  

- The actual tool call aligns completely with the expected tool call. The tool name and the required arguments (`expression` and `variable`) match, with no violation of argument alignment. Therefore, Objective 2 is successfully achieved.  

**Objective 3: Success**  
- The final answer is:  
  - `""The derivative of the expression '2*x^2 + 3*x + 1' with respect to x is '4*x + 3'.""`  

- Model validated its final answer against the data fetched from the API call. The derivative computed via the tool call (`response: ""3 + 4*x""`) matches exactly with the final answer. Additionally, the final response fulfills the user's instruction to compute the derivative.  

**Reason:**  
- For Objective 2: The actual tool used and its required arguments match the expected tool call, demonstrating successful alignment.  
- For Objective 3: The model based its final response on the data retrieved from the API call and successfully answered the user's instruction to compute the derivative of the given expression. Thus, both objectives are met appropriately."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2: The actual tools invoked were:  
   - `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile { ""username"": ""leomessi"" }`  
   - `get_username_for_instagram_profile { ""is_id"": ""427553890"" }`.  

   The required tools were:  
   - `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile { ""username"": ""leomessi"" }`  
   - `get_story_for_instagram_profile { ""username"": ""leomessi"" }`.  

   Upon comparing the two sets:
   - The tool call `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` matches with the expected one.
   - The model failed to invoke `get_story_for_instagram_profile`, which was a required API call.
   - Additionally, the unnecessary call `get_username_for_instagram_profile` was made by the model, but that does not affect the judgment in this scenario.  
   As all expected API calls were not made, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

2. For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. However, by reviewing the final answer provided, the response includes only information from `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` but completely ignores additional user instruction, i.e., information retrieval from stories (`get_story_for_instagram_profile`). Moreover, there is no API data-based response addressing the error encountered in `get_username_for_instagram_profile`."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The model successfully retrieved the required definition through the API call to `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary`. In its final response, the presented definition of ""onomatopoeia"" corresponds accurately to the details provided by the API response (e.g., sound imitation related to words such as ""sizzle,"" ""splash,"" or ""croak""). Additionally, the explanation further correctly elaborates on how onomatopoeia is used in poetry and prose, aligning its answer with the retrieved information from the invoked tools rather than fabricating the answer. The achievement of the user's request of explaining ""onomatopoeia"" proves an effective problem solution grounded in API-fetched data."

The required tool call is:  
`'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'` with arguments:  
`'{ ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR"" }'`  
The tool name and arguments are correct. Since the actual tool call matches the required tool call, Objective 2 is a success.

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The model gave the correct and logical final answer:  
`""The current exchange rate from JPY to EUR is 1 JPY = 0.0062 EUR. Converting 1000 JPY would give you 6.2 EUR.""`  
This answer fulfills the user's requirement. The exchange rate and calculation (""1000 JPY = 6.2 EUR"") is clearly derived from the API response content. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."

#### Comparison:
When comparing the actual tool calls made by the model to the expected tool call:  
- The required tool was successfully called (`get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`) with the correct arguments `{ ""username"": ""kleido007"" }`.  
- Despite the model invoking multiple additional tools (`get_categories_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`, `get_posts_from_category_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`, ""Finish""), these did not interfere with the element we are verifying.

**Result for Objective 2: Success**

### Evaluation for Objective 3:

#### Final Response:
The `final_answer` was provided via the `Finish` tool call:

```json
{
  ""return_type"": ""give_answer"",
  ""final_answer"": ""Here are your requested details:...""
}
```

However, on careful analysis of the content:  
- The final answer repeatedly veered into nonsensical or malformed statements due to improper sentence structuring: e.g., ""The 'random' Category big lists housing personal dane Found.""
- Though minimal mention of categories like `memes` and `random` were observed, the response is not structured coherently or comprehensively in successfully presenting the content of these categories based on data extracted from relevant API calls.

**Result for Objective 3: Failure,** as the fulfillment of the instruction was neither logical nor clear, and most of the presented text lacked informative reliability or validation against retrieved data.

### Conclusion:
Objective 2: Success  
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The required tool, `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`, was called correctly with proper parameters (needed to ensure success for Objective 2). However, the final response failed to achieve usable or correctly adapted content from retrieved API datasets, resulting in the model's inability to resolve the original user's request effectively."

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `{""url"": ""8394725634879021564""}`  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The first required tool call (`get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video`) was invoked, but the URL parameter was incorrect, as `""7002634556977908485""` does not match `""8394725634879021564""`. The second required tool call (`get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video`) was not invoked at all. Thus, the model failed to meet the requirements of the expected API calls.  

**Objective 3:** Given that Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure. Additionally, the model did not successfully retrieve any relevant information about the music or related videos. Instead, an error was returned, and the assistant proceeded with an incomplete message explaining the issue but did not fulfill the user's instruction or provide a correct final answer. No final answer meaningful to the user instruction was completed successfully."

Specifically, the model invoked different tools including `user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video` and `search_user_for_tiktok_download_video`, which are not the required API calls. Thus, Objective 2 fails. Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is directly marked as a failure as well."

The model invoked one tool `'Finish'` with arguments `'{ ""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"" }'`, which is inconsistent with the required API calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

- For Objective 3, given that Objective 2 failed (the required API calls were not made), we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. The model chose to ""give up and restart"" instead of answering the user's instruction based on the needed data. Hence, the required user instruction was not fulfilled."
35,Find the streamer 'shadoune66666' streamer's info.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- The required tool call was **`get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api`** with arguments `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model was **`get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api`** with arguments `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`.  
- As both the tool name and arguments match correctly, Objective 2 is a success. 
 
- For Objective 3, the model provided the correct final answer: **""The streamer 'shadoune666' (User ID: 36533048) exists on Twitch but is currently offline. Let me know if you need more specific details regarding this streamer!""**  
- This response is consistent with the data retrieved from the API (`shadoune666` with user ID `36533048` exists and is currently offline). Thus, the user instruction was achieved, and the final answer is valid."
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
- The required API call is:  
  *Tool Name*: `products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls`  
  *Arguments*: `{""upc"": ""194574942221""}`  

- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  *Tool Name*: `products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls`  
  *Arguments*: `{""upc"": ""286193748563""}`  

The tool name matches the required one, but the `upc` argument does not match. The expected argument `upc` should be `""194574942221""`, but the model supplied `""286193748563""`. This mismatch results in a failure for Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude Objective 3 also fails as per the evaluation guidance. Furthermore, the model's final response notes its failure to retrieve the relevant information due to the provided barcode not being found. It eventually gives up with no retrieval of the requested product detail for the required `upc`. This reinforces the failure to achieve the user's instruction."
37,"I'm redecorating my home and looking for furniture options. Can you list the available furniture products on Kohls? Also, provide me with the product reviews for a specific product with webID 5372023.",8,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
1. **For Objective 2**:  
   - The required API call is: `reviews_list_for_kohls` with arguments `{ ""productid"": ""4201989"" }`.  
   - The actual API calls made by the model are multiple calls to `reviews_list_for_kohls`, but they are invoked with arguments:  
     * `{""productid"": ""5372023""}` (twice ??both with and without a `limit` argument).  
   - None of the calls match the required arguments, as `productid` is not `""4201989""`, which makes the attempt a failure for Objective 2.  
     
2. **For Objective 3**:  
   - Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. This is because failure in making accurate tool calls means the final response from the API data cannot fulfill or address the user's original request for reviews of the product with ID `""4201989""`. Moreover, the provided content did not fulfill the instruction, and multiple ""restart"" attempts serve no valid answer delivery."
38,"I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this product, including images, pricing, and customer reviews?",46,8,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. The required API calls are:  
   - `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` with `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`
   - `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`.  

2. The actual tool calls are:  
   - `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}` [**Matches Required Call 2**]
   - Multiple instances of the `'products_search_for_wayfair'` API and others like `'products_list_for_wayfair'` and `'categories_list_for_wayfair'` (but none for the expected `'products_detail_for_wayfair'`).

While the `reviews_list_for_wayfair` tool call is accurate and meets the requirements, the `products_detail_for_wayfair` call is **missing** entirely. This missing API call makes the test fail for Objective 2.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed (due to the omission of `'products_detail_for_wayfair'`), the model's ability to use the required data to fulfill the user's instructions is inherently inadequate. Furthermore, the model stated that it could not retrieve sufficient product-related information, confirming the user's request was not adequately addressed. Additionally, the use of tools not specified in the expected API calls suggests a lack of focus in effectively resolving the query."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,67,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls are:  
1. `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` with arguments `{'sku': 'W003247135'}`.  
2. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `{'sku': 'W003247135'}`.  

The actual tool calls made were:  
1. `'products_search_for_wayfair'` with arguments `{""keyword"": ""W003247135"", ""itemsperpage"": 1}`.  
2. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}` (called multiple times).  

The required `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` call was not made. Instead, the model made several other calls like `'products_search_for_wayfair'` for searching by keyword, which does not match the required API at all. While `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with the correct `sku` parameter was invoked, the lack of the required `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` API call causes this objective to fail.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer Objective 3 as a failure. The results retrieved do not satisfy the requirement because the necessary `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` API call, used for obtaining specific product details, was not invoked at any point. Without this critical data, the user's instruction cannot be fully achieved. The assistant made attempts to gather data from alternative tools but ultimately failed to generate a conclusive final response derived from the appropriate API data. Further, no valid and complete final answer was provided to satisfy the user's request."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with argument `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  
2. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with argument `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`.  

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
1. `Finish` with argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

The required tools were not invoked as the model instead used an unrelated tool to ""give up and restart."" Thus, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3, since the model did not provide any final answer based on the required API responses and instead gave up, Objective 3 also fails."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",12,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
  **Required API Calls:**  
  1. `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`  
  2. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`  
  3. `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`  

  **Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**  
  1. `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
  2. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
  3. `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

  The tool names and their required arguments (with different capitalization between `productId` and `productid`) match functionally. Additional parameters, if any, do not conflict with the expected behavior, so Objective 2 succeeds.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  The final answer provided by the model fails to accurately fulfill the user's request. The model explicitly stated, ""*Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,*"" indicating an unsuccessful resolution. Despite invoking all required tools, the output was not derived from the gathered API data, and the user's instruction was not achieved. Hence, Objective 3 fails."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,6,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**For Objective 2**: The required API call was:  
- Name: `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`  
  Arguments: `{\n  ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""\n }`

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
- Name: `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`  
  Arguments: `{""is_id"":""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`  

The tool name and the required argument (`is_id: 6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7`) match exactly. Although the model initially made another attempt with an incomplete ID (`is_id: d27e0de553b9d7`), the accurate call was correctly made, which means the required API call was executed successfully. Furthermore, while the model invoked an additional ""Finish"" tool to organize the output in its final response, this tool was not required, so it does not affect successfully meeting Objective 2 based on the given evaluation criteria. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.

**For Objective 3**: The_final_answer_ given by the model was:  
`The race with ID ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" is the FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022, which is race number 1. It is scheduled to take place on March 19, 2022, at 15:00 UTC.`  

The retrieved data from the tool calls was:  

```
{'_id': '6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7', 'race_no': 1, 'track': 'FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022', 'date': '2022-03-19T15:00:00.000Z'}
```

The final answer accurately matches the information retrieved from the API (ID, track name, race number, and scheduled date). Additionally, all content in the answer is directly derived from and supported by the API response, fulfilling the user's instruction. No extraneous or made-up information was introduced. 

Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"`{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""}'}`.  

While the tool name (`select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`) matches, the argument `is_id` differs. The expected value is `6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7`, while the model invoked the tool with `d27e0de553b9d7`, which is incomplete and incorrect. As the arguments are incorrect, the actual tool call does not meet the requirements, leading to failure.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Objective 3 directly fails because Objective 2 failed, as per the evaluation rules. Additionally, evaluating whether the final answer is valid: the answer provided by the model is convoluted and includes errors in reasoning/explanation of the data retrieved from tool usage (e.g., referencing incomprehensible details such as ""wrapp functionsalternateBand??. These points further reinforce failure since the response neither fulfills the user's instruction nor is exploitable based on proper API call results."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",5,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The expected API call was `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with `{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`.  
The model first used the tool `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with `{""symbol"": ""QQQQ""}`. Although this does not match the expected API call, the model, in a subsequent round, invoked the same tool `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with a corrected argument `{""symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`, aligning with the required call (both tool name and arguments fit the criteria). Thus, the required API call was eventually made correctly. The additional tools invoked (e.g., `'Finish'`) are not considered in the evaluation of success.  

**Objective 3**:  
The model did not produce a final answer for the user?ôs original question because the workflow resulted in a ""give up and restart"" scenario. Since there was no response/redirection adequately fulfilling the user's request (e.g., providing stock information for ""TQQQ""), this task is marked as a failure based on the criteria for processing Objective 3."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
1. For Objective 2:  
   - The tool invoked by the model was `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`.  
   - The required API call was `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`.  
   - Both the tool name and the argument are correct and match the required API call. Therefore, the outcome for Objective 2 is a success.  

2. For Objective 3:  
   - The final response given by the model is as follows:  
     ```
     Here are Riven's base stats:
     - Health: 630.0 (+100 per level)
     - Health Regen: 8.5 (+0.5 per level)
     - Mana: N/A (Riven doesn?ôt use mana)
     - Mana Regen: No mana usage
     - Attack Damage: 64.0 (+3 per level)
     - Attack Speed: 0.625 (+3.5% per level)
     - Armor: 33.0 (+4.4 per level)
     - Magic Resist: 32.0 (+2.05 per level)
     - Movement Speed: 340.0
     - Attack Range: 125.0.
     Let me know if you need any additional information about this champion!
     ```
   - This final answer aligns correctly with the data retrieved via the API call to `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'`, confirming that the response is based on the API data.  
   - The user's instruction to retrieve Riven's base stats was successfully fulfilled.  

   Consequently, the outcome for Objective 3 is a success."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the expected tool call is:  
  `('name': 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""\n }')`.  
  The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data' with '{""asin"":""B07ZPKBL9V""}'`.  
  Both the tool name and the arguments (specifically, the ASIN ""B07ZPKBL9V"") match the required API calls perfectly. Therefore, this part is evaluated as a success.

- For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model is:  
  `""Here are the product details for the ASIN 'B07ZPKBL9V': ??`.  "
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

1. For **Objective 2 (Tool Call Accuracy):**  
   - **Expected Tool Calls:**  
     - `translate_for_translate_all_languages` with arguments:  
       ```json
       {
         ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",
         ""toLang"": ""fr""
       }
       ```
   - **Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**  
     - `translate_for_translate_all_languages` with arguments:  
       ```json
       {
         ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",
         ""tolang"": ""fr""
       }
       ```
     Here, the tool name is correct, and the arguments match semantically. The key `""toLang""` in the expected call and `""tolang""` in the actual call are considered equivalent (based on Rule #3 regarding truncated or miscapitalized spelling). There are no deviations in structure, meaning, or accuracy, so this fulfills Objective 2.  

2. For **Objective 3 (Final Answer Evaluation):**  
   - The model retrieved information via the correct tool call (`translate_for_translate_all_languages`) and obtained the translated text.  
   - The final answer provided by the model was:  
     ```
     The text 'Hello, how are you?' has been successfully translated to French (fr). The translation is: 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'.
     ```
   - This response correctly achieved the user's instruction (translating the input text into French) and explicitly references data retrieved from the API response (`'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'`). The final answer is detailed and accurate.

Thus, both objectives were successfully fulfilled."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  - **Tools invoked by the model:**  
    `'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{ ""country_code"":""US"", ""date"":""2022-12-31"" }'`  
  - **Expected tool calls:**  
    `'get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{ ""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31"" }'`
  - The invoked tool differs in name (`get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` instead of `get_info_day_for_working_days`), but it is clear that they refer to the same tool given that the arguments exactly match. This fulfills the API comparison required for Objective 2 successfully.  
   
- For Objective 3:  
  - Final answer: `""The date '2022-12-31' is not a working day in the United States. It falls on a weekend (Saturday) and is not a public holiday.""`  
  - The response correctly explains the date validation by identifying that December 31, 2022, is not a working day. This conclusion aligns with the API data retrieved (`working_day: 0`, `weekend_day: 1`, `public_holiday: '0'`, etc.). Therefore, the user's instruction was fulfilled, and the data from the API was appropriately used to derive the conclusion."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The expected tool call specified is `{'name': 'analyse_for_working_days', 'arguments': '{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US""}'}`.  
  The tool invoked by the model is `{'function': {'name': 'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days', 'arguments': '{""start_date"":""2013-01-01"",""end_date"":""2013-12-31"",""country_code"":""US""}'}}`.  
  The tool name (""analyse_for_working_days"") and the model-invoked equivalent (""get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days"") differ slightly in form but clearly point to the same API functionality with no spelling or semantic mistakes in the command. Moreover, all the required arguments (`start_date`, `end_date`, `country_code`) align correctly with exact values. Only the naming differs slightly, which is acceptable, as stipulated in the evaluation guidelines.  
  The tool call made by the model fulfills all requirements of the expected tool call, and hence Objective 2 is a success.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The model correctly returns the user's requested data based on the retrieved API data. The final answer provided states specific details?îincluding total days (365), working days (251), weekend days (104), and public holidays (10)?îall of which directly match information retrieved from the tool response. The structured breakdown also forms a coherent answer to the user's query, effectively fulfilling the instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:  
- **Actual tool call invoked by the model**:  
    `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
      ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
      ""country_code"": ""US"",
      ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
      ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""
    }
    ```

- **Required tool call**:  
    `add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
      ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
      ""country_code"": ""US"",
      ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
      ""increment_time"": 2004
    }
    ```

The tool name and the structure of the arguments do not fully match. The required tool name is `add_working_hours_for_working_days`, which differs from the actual tool invoked (`get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days`). Although the argument values (start date, country code, and start time) are correct, the `""increment_time"": ""2004:00""` provided by the model is formatted incorrectly; the required format was `""increment_time"": 2004` (an integer). Due to these discrepancies, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails."
