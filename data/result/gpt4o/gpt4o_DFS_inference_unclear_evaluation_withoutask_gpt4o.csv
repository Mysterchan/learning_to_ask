1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',12,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2:**  
- **Expected Tool Call:** `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: 
  ```
  {
    ""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""
  }
  ```  
- **Actual Tool Calls:**
  - `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{""query"": ""The Matrix"", ""limit_titles"": 1}`  
  - `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{""query"": ""The Matrix Movie 1999"", ""limit_titles"": 1}`  
  - `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{""query"": ""Matrix"", ""limit_titles"": 5}`  
  - `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{""query"": ""Matrix Neo 1999 Movie"", ""limit_titles"": 1}`  

The expected tool call specifically required searching for ""The Matrix Revolutions"". However, none of the invoked tool calls matched this requirement; all variations of the query differ significantly and focus on ""The Matrix"" or other terms unrelated to ""The Matrix Revolutions"". As the expected tool call was not executed, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

---

**For Objective 3:**  
Objective 2 was already marked as a failure. Since information relevant to fulfilling the user query was not retrieved, and there was no coherent final response provided by the model, **Objective 3 is considered a failure**."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
`{ 'name': 'search_for_netflix_v2', 'arguments': '{ ""query"": ""\'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\'""}'}`  

The model invoked:
1. `search_for_netflix_v2` with `{""query"":""star wars"",""limit_titles"":1}`  

The required arguments explicitly need the query as `""\'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\'""` in the expected API call. The model?ôs actual `query` argument `""star wars""` does not meet the expectations in spelling precision or intent (missing the specificity required, as well as extra contextual targeting `""limit_titles""`). Hence, this is considered a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure. Thus, the final generated output cannot be validated as fulfilling the user's instruction since one core tool call failed."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call was **`'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'`** with **arguments:** *{""date1"":""12-01-2023"", ""date2"":""12-31-2023""}*. However, the actual tool call invoked by the model was **`'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'`** with **arguments:** *{""date1"":""12-01-2022"",""date2"":""12-31-2022""}*. The year in the arguments does not match (""2022"" vs. ""2023""), resulting in a mismatch. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure. Per the provided rule, a failure in Objective 2 leads to a direct failure in Objective 3."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`, but the model did not invoke this API. Instead, the model invoked the `'Finish'` function with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which does not match or fulfill the required tool call. This discrepancy leads to a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a valid final answer based on the user's instruction. Instead, the model seemed to ""give up and restart,"" as inferred from the function it invoked and its associated content. Consequently, this fails to achieve the user's instruction, resulting in a failure for Objective 3."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,5,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2:**  
The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-12-18""}'`.  

The required tool calls are:  
1. `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}'`.  

The tool names match, and the required arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}` were correctly and faithfully provided in the invoked tool call by the model. Moreover, while the model did make additional calls like the ""Finish"" tool, these do not impact the evaluation of required tool calls. Therefore, the outcome for Objective 2 is **success**.  

**For Objective 3:**  
The final response provided by the model is:  
> `""Unfortunately, I was unable to retrieve the football scores for the last World Cup final's date, December 18, 2022. This might have been due to an error or an unavailability of the data. Please check again later or contact relevant data authorities for confirmation.""`  

This response is based directly on the outcome of the tool calls. The tool response for the `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` revealed an empty response when queried for the specified date (`2022-12-18`). The user's instruction (retrieving football scores) could not be fulfilled, but the final response reflects this fact faithfully and effectively communicates that the data was unavailable. This indicates the model used the API call properly and based its answer on the retrieved tool data. Therefore, Objective 3 is **success**."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   

- For Objective 2: The expected API call is `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""teaching in London""}`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""professional jobs in London"", ""country"":""gb"", ""radius"":50, ""num_pages"":""1""}`. The argument `""query""` is significantly different as it uses `""professional jobs in London""` instead of `""teaching in London""`, which alters the target job query substantially. Thus, the actual tool call does not match the required API call, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

- For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically inferred to be a failure as well."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:
1. The required API call was `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York""}`. The actual tool called by the model was `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""engineering in new york""}`. The query argument does not match semantically or spelling-wise (e.g., ""machanical"" is misspelled as ""mechanical,"" and ""machanical engineer"" has a very specific meaning compared to the model's broader ""engineering in new york""), so Objective 2 is a failure.     
2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- First, let's verify the tool calls for Objective 2:  
  - The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
    > `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""query"":""ronaldo""}'`  
    > `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""is_id"":8198}'`  
  - The required API calls are:  
    > `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{ ""query"": ""Ronaldo"" }'`  
    > `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": 3140 }'`  

  Upon comparison:
  - In the first tool call `'search_for_transfermarket'`, the query string `""ronaldo""` (in all lowercase) matches semantically with `""Ronaldo""`, so it is acceptable.  
  - For the second tool call `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'`, the value of `""is_id""` was supposed to be `3140`, but the invoked API used a different id (`8198`). This ID mismatch shows that the wrong player's profile was retrieved. Therefore, the requirements for this tool call were not satisfied, and Objective 2 fails.  

- As per the rules, if Objective 2 fails, then Objective 3 automatically fails as well without further evaluation. This means the final answer also cannot be deemed valid since it was based on incorrect API usage."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**:  
The required API call is: `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""job_title"": ""software developer"",
  ""location"": ""New York""
}
```
The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  

1. `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""query"": ""professional jobs for fresh graduates in New York"",
  ""radius"": 50,
  ""num_pages"": ""1""
}
```

2. `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""location"": ""New York"",
  ""job_title"": ""mental health"",
  ""radius"": 50
}
```

3. `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""location"": ""New York"",
  ""job_title"": ""professional graduates"",
  ""radius"": 50
}
```

The model fails to invoke the exact required API call (`'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with the correct `""job_title"": ""software developer""` and `""location"": ""New York""`). None of the tool calls align with the expected API call arguments. The job titles such as ""mental health"" and ""professional graduates"" have completely different meanings from ""software developer."" Therefore, **Objective 2 is considered a failure**.  

For **Objective 3**:  
Since **Objective 2** is a failure because the required API call was not invoked correctly, it automatically implies failure for **Objective 3**, as the model could not gather and use the correct data to fulfill the user's instruction. The user's requirement to focus on estimated salaries for ""software developers"" in New York was not addressed in the model's tool calls or final answer."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call was `search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search` with the argument `{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }`. However, the model's actual tool call invoked `search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search` with the argument `{ ""query"": ""Star Wars"" }`. The query used is not the same as the required one, and ""Star Wars"" does not match ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"". Therefore, the tool call does not align with the requirements, making Objective 2 a failure. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails based on the guidelines."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }`. However, the model did not invoke this tool at all. Instead, the actual tool calls included 'Finish', which does not match the required tool call. Additionally, none of the arguments correspond to the required arguments for fetching football scores based on a specific date.  

For Objective 3, the model requested further input from the user to proceed (e.g., asking for the date of the user's birthday), and eventually provided a final answer stating the need for that specific information to assist further. However, this final response failed to fulfill the user's original instruction (fetching football scores) and was not based on any successful API call, as the required tool was never invoked. Without invoking the correct tool, achieving the user's instruction becomes impossible. As such, Objective 3 is also a failure."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,5,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required tool call is:  
  ```  
  'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with arguments '{  
    ""season"": ""2020""  
  }'  
  ```  

- The actual tool call invoked by the model that matches this is:  
  ```  
  'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with arguments '{  
    ""season"": ""2020""  
  }'  
  ```  

The tool name and arguments are accurate and match perfectly. Additional tool calls were invoked by the model (such as `Finish` and `tours_for_golf_leaderboard_data`), but they do not affect the evaluation of Objective 2 since the model correctly called all expected tools as specified in the required calls.  

For Objective 3:  
- The retrieved data is successfully used to address the user's instruction. The projected PGA rankings for the 2020 season were checked, and the model provided the correct final answer:  
  ""The projected PGA rankings for the 2020 season did not yield any specific data in the latest results available. This might suggest either sparse tournament activity or unavailable updates from which rankings could be computed.""  

The final answer directly corresponds to the data retrieved via the API call, fulfilling the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is also successfully accomplished."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call was:  
- `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with `{""tournament_id"": ""650""}`  

However, the actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `'tours_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with `{}`  
2. `'fixtures_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with `{""tour_id"": 2, ""season_id"": 2023}`  
3. `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with `{""tournament_id"": 474}` *(argument mismatch: the required `""tournament_id""` is 650, but the model used 474)*  

Since the `tournament_id` argument does not match between the required and actual tool call and argument values *must* match exactly, Objective 2 is unsuccessful.  

---

Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason:  
When Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer Objective 3 also fails. Specifically, the model could not achieve the user's instruction as required because the mismatched `tournament_id` in the API call means the leaderboard data retrieved does not correspond to the expected tournament `""tournament_id"": 650`. Hence, the final answer was not achieved correctly based on the correct API data."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The actual tool call invoked by the model is:

15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,7,Success,Failure,Failure,"`'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `'{ ""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }'`.  
However, the tool calls made by the model were:  
- `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `'{ ""season"":""2012"",""category"":""returnpoints"",""surface"":""clay""}'`.  
- `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `'{ ""season"":""2012"",""category"":""returnpointswon1stserve"",""surface"":""clay""}'`.  
- `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `'{ ""season"":""2012"",""category"":""returnpointswon2ndserve"",""surface"":""clay""}'`.  

The model's tool calls involved incorrectly specified API arguments for the ""category"" parameter. Instead of ""return"", it used ""returnpoints"", ""returnpointswon1stserve"", and ""returnpointswon2ndserve"", which do not match the required value of ""return"". The argument mismatch leads to failure for Objective 2.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails since the API call was incorrect, meaning the request was not appropriately fulfilled. Additionally, the model ultimately gave up and restarted, showing it failed to effectively retrieve meaningful data to fulfill the user's original request."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call was:  
```python
{
    ""name"": ""exchange_for_currency_v2"",
    ""arguments"": '{\n  ""base"": ""RMB"",\n  ""to"": ""GBP""\n }'
}
```  
The actual tool invoked by the model was:  
```python
{
    ""name"": ""exchange_for_currency_v2"",
    ""arguments"": '{""base"":""CNY"",""to"":""GBP""}'
}
```  
While the `to` argument (""GBP"") matches perfectly, the `base` argument is `""CNY""` in the actual tool call and `""RMB""` in the required API call. Although ""CNY"" and ""RMB"" are closely related (CNY is the official code for RMB), this does not meet the exact spelling requirement laid out in the instructional guideline which forbids spelling inconsistency (or mismatched values). Thus, Objective 2 fails.

As Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically a failure, as the user's requirements are grounded on valid execution of API calls."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was indeed `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'`, but with arguments `{""username"":""Jack""}`. The required `username` argument and the actual `username` argument differ ('the_beautyofcinema' vs. 'Jack'), making this a failure of Objective 2.  

Due to the dependency rule, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails, irrespective of the final output provided by the model."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**  
   - **Tools Invoked by the Model:**  
     - `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  
     - `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  
     - `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  

   - **Required API Calls:**  
     - `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  
     - `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  
     - `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  

   - The tools invoked by the model match all the required API calls with correct tool names and arguments. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

2. **Objective 3**  
   - The model successfully retrieves data from all three API calls (`stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2`) and effectively integrates it into the provided final response.  
   - The final response accurately fulfills the user's request for a detailed analysis of Tesla's (TSLA) index trend information, quarterly and yearly balance sheets, and institutional ownership details. Specifically:  
     - **Index Trend Info:** Includes key metrics like the PE Ratio, PEG Ratio, and growth estimates extracted from the API response.  
     - **Balance Sheet Info:** Shows quarterly balance sheets ending September 30, 2024, and yearly summaries from 2020 to 2023.  
     - **Institutional Ownership:** Included specific ownership data attributed to Vanguard Group Inc and Blackrock Inc, aligning directly with the API response.  
   - Therefore, the model leveraged the API responses fully to construct a valid, accurate answer, and **Objective 3 is a success**."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",7,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2: The required API calls specify `symbol` as ""JNVR"", but the actual tool calls made by the model used the argument `""symbol"": ""JANV""` for all tools, which is not equivalent or semantically identical to ""JNVR"". As the argument is incorrect, the actual tool calls fail to match the required API calls, rendering Objective 2 a failure.    

For Objective 3: As Objective 2 failed, it is directly inferred that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, reviewing the final answer provided in `{ ""final_answer"" }`, the model delivers an explanation based on the system's failure to retrieve data, which aligns with its API responses. However, since it failed Objective 2 due to the incorrect symbol specified, the response cannot fulfill the user's instruction, making this step a failure as well."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"The required API call is:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}`  

The APIs invoked by the model include:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}`  

The tool names match exactly, and the arguments are also consistent with the required API call. Therefore, this satisfies Objective 2.

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
""Here are the relevant index trend details for Nvidia (Ticker: NVDA):  

1. Stock represented is tied to symbol: SP5 (S&P 500-related trends).  
2. P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings): 17.75.  
3. PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth): 1.38.  
4. Estimated growth metrics:  
   - Current quarter (0q): 5% (0.05 raw value).  
   - Upcoming quarter (+1q): 12% (0.12 raw value).  
   - Current year (0y): 2% (0.021 raw value).  
   - Upcoming year (+1y): 12% (0.122 raw value).  
   - Next five years (+5y): 11% (0.110056 raw value).  

These metrics can offer great valuation insights for your stock trading and growth expectations regarding Nvidia.""

This final answer appropriately incorporates the data retrieved from the tool call response, specifically data related to the symbol ""NVDA,"" P/E and PEG ratios, and the growth estimates. Furthermore, the final answer is relevant, accurate, and reflective of the retrieved tool response, thereby fulfilling the user's original request for index trend details for Nvidia. Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,7,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:**  
The expected tool call is:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments: `'{""symbol"": ""DJR""}'`  

The model invoked the following tool:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments: `'{""symbol"":""DJR""}'`.  

The tool name and the required argument `""symbol""` with value `""DJR""` perfectly match between the expected API call and the actual API call. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide any answer derived from the result of the required API call (`'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with `""symbol"": ""DJR""`). Instead, it appears to loop through various tools exploring results under different assumptions for the Dow Jones, utilizing tickers such as `""^DJI""` and `""DIA""` but ultimately fails to build a coherent final answer addressing the user requirement derived from the only expected API data related to `""symbol"": ""DJR""` (evidenced by its meaningless and garbled final output). Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2:  
   - The model invoked the following tool(s): `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""META""}`.  
   - The required API call(s) are: `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{ ""symbol"": ""META"" }`.  
   - The tool name matches, and the arguments are consistent. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

2. For Objective 3:  
   - The final answer provided by the model is:  
     ```
     The index trend for Facebook (meta symbol) stock is as follows:
     - For the upcoming quarter, the projected growth is 0.12 (12%).
     - For the current year, the projected growth is 0.14 (14%).
     - For the next year, the projected growth is 0.13 (13%).
     - Long-term growth rate is 0.08 (8%).
     ```
   - This aligns with the data retrieved from the tool response, where the listed growth estimates match the retrieved data accurately. The answer fulfills the user's request for the index trend of META (Facebook) stock.  
   - Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required tool call was `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`.  
The actual tool call made by the model was `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `{""channel"": ""shadoune kane""}`.   
The two arguments differ, as the required API call specifies the Twitch channel as `""shadoune666""`, while the actual call uses `""shadoune kane""`. This discrepancy in the channel name is critical, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails. The mismatch in the required argument caused the model to retrieve incorrect or no data from the API. Consequently, the final response does not meet the user's request to retrieve valid information for the streamer ""shadoune666""."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**

   ""arguments"": '{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}'
  }
  ```
  - However, the actual tool call for `video_details_for_tiktok_api` invoked by the model used the arguments as `'{}'`. The necessary argument `""video_id""` was missing entirely, which made the call invalid compared to the required tool call.  
  - Additionally, even though a `user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api` tool call was successfully invoked, it was not required and not relevant to evaluating Objective 2.
- As the necessary API call required in the task failed in Objective 2, the response and final answer cannot be trusted entirely to have fulfilled the user's requirement. Therefore, Objective 3 directly fails since it relies on the data being successfully obtained from the expected API call."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",11,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The model made the following tool call instances related to the API `historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes`:
1. `{""symbol"":""ESTC"",""interval"":""4h_2024-01-01_to_2024-12-30""}`  
2. `{""symbol"":""ESTC"",""interval"":""4hour""}`  
3. `{""symbol"":""ESTC"",""interval"":""4hour""}`  

The required API call is:
`{'name': 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes', 'arguments': '{\n ""symbol"": ""ESTC""\n , ""interval"": ""4hour""\n, ""from"": ""2024-01-01""\n, ""to"": ""2024-12-30""\n}'}`  

The issues identified:  
- The model failed to include the 'from' and 'to' arguments (`""from"": ""2024-01-01""` and `""to"": ""2024-12-30""`) in any of the submitted tool calls.  
- Additionally, some incorrect interval formats (`""4h_2024-01-01_to_2024-12-30""`) were used initially.

Due to these discrepancies, **Objective 2 fails as the model did not submit a correct tool call adhering to the required API call structure**.

---

**Objective 3:**  
The final response cannot fulfill the user's instruction as none of the successful tool outputs matched the required parameters or date range provided in the user's request. Despite invoking the API multiple times with the corrected `'interval': '4hour'` argument, responses contained 2025 data, which does not fulfill the user request for data from `""from"": ""2024-01-01""` and `""to"": ""2024-12-30""`.  

Additionally, the completion from the model either outputs incomplete/error-prone information or ultimately calls the 'Finish' tool selecting ""give_up_and_restart."" Therefore, **the user's requirement was not fulfilled, and the answer was not based on valid tool responses aligning with the timeframe and required format**."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

In Objective 2, the required tool call is: 
```  
{'name': 'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{ ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"" }'} 
```  
The model invoked the ""Finish"" tool multiple times with arguments such as:  
```  
{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""Let me know the exact endpoint details next, so I can tailor info in Binance-like service dataset, etc sources. User input...""}  
```  
And  
```  
{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}  
```

None of the actual tool calls matches the required tool call, as neither the tool name `ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` nor its arguments were invoked. Thus, this results in a **failure for Objective 2**.  

Because the model failed to make the required API call in Objective 2, we infer direct failure for Objective 3 as the required tool calls to obtain relevant data were never made. Furthermore, there is no meaningful final answer provided that fulfills the user's instruction (no time series analysis from Binance was conducted).  

In conclusion, Objective 2 fails because the required tool call was not invoked, and Objective 3 fails as the required data was not fetched or used to provide the final answer."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,17,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls were:

In analyzing all the API calls made by the model, none of them conformed strictly to the arguments specified in the required calls. The actual tool calls made were as follows:

28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the required API calls involve the symbol ""SYNX"" as the argument for three tools:  
  1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`.
  2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`.
  3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`.    

  However, in the actual tool calls by the model:   
  1. The symbol used in the arguments is **""SLYX""**, which does not match ""SYNX"" required in the expected API calls.
  As acronyms/ticker codes are sensitive, spelling mismatches are not permitted when assessing tools, hence causing failure in Objective 2.  

- For Objective 3, given that Objective 2 is a failure, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 is also a failure. The inadequacy in invoking the correct tools (`""SYNX""` vs. `""SLYX""`) means the final answer did not successfully fulfill the user's request (laid out as input requirements with `SYNX`). Additionally, the model did not present conclusions correctly derived from the API responses?îthe error messages confirm that the request execution for ""SYNX"" wasn't properly followed."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"The expected tool calls were `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with the following arguments:  
1. `{""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`  
2. `{""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT""}`  

The model, however, made four calls to the `historical_rates_for_metals_prices_rates_api` tool with the following arguments:  
1. `{""date"": ""2024-02-09"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""base"": ""USD""}`  
2. `{""date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""base"": ""USD""}`  
3. `{""date"": ""2024-02-09"", ""symbols"": ""XPT"", ""base"": ""USD""}`  
4. `{""date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""symbols"": ""XPT"", ""base"": ""USD""}`  

These do not align with the expected tool name (`time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api`) and lack the required argument structure (e.g., `start_date` and `end_date` for time-series data). As a result, the tool invocations by the model fail to meet the required API calls.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can infer Objective 3 is also a failure. Despite the final response correctly showing historical rates for February 9, 2024, and February 10, 2024, the result contradicts the instructions, which explicitly asked for time-series prices from February 10, 2024, to February 13, 2024. The final answer fails to align with the expected data and does not serve the user instruction effectively."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""interval"": ""y1"",
  ""is_id"": ""02823""

The actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:  
1. `'market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance'` with arguments `'{""query"":""China""}'`.  
2. `'market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance'` with arguments `'{""query"":""CSI 300""}'`.  
3. `'market_get_chart_for_bb_finance'` with arguments `'{""interval"":""y1"",""is_id"":""SHSZ300:IND""}'`.  

The model did not invoke the required API call (`'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'`) with the expected arguments. Instead, it invoked `'market_get_chart_for_bb_finance'` with `""is_id"": ""SHSZ300:IND""`, which does not match the required `""is_id"": ""02823""`. As the required API call has not been executed correctly, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. The user's instruction was not fulfilled because the required data for `""is_id"": ""02823""` was not retrieved. Furthermore, while the model completed the task based on its retrieval for `""SHSZ300:IND""`, this does not align with the specific required data for `""02823""`. Thus, the final response does not achieve the user's instructional goal."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5` with `{ ""date"": ""01-02-2024"" }`, but the actual tool call made by the model is `drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5` with `{ ""date"": ""11-13-2023"" }`. The date mismatch indicates an incorrect argument in the API call, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically inferred to be a failure as well."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{ ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023"" }'}`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
`{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{""date1"":""09-01-2023"",""date2"":""09-30-2023""}'}`  

The tool name invoked by the model matches the required tool name. However, the arguments for `date1` and `date2` differ significantly. The model passed `""date1"": ""09-01-2023""` and `""date2"": ""09-30-2023""` instead of the required `""date1"": ""12-01-2023""` and `""date2"": ""12-31-2023""`. Since the arguments are incorrect, this results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 fails (due to incorrect arguments in the tool call), it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also fails. The final answer provided is therefore based on incorrect or irrelevant tool data and does not satisfactorily fulfill the user's instruction for December 2023."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`. However, the required API call was `'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""variables"": """", ""values"": """", ""expression"": ""5+10""}'`. Since the required tool was not invoked, Objective 2 fails.  
- **Objective 3**: As Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer Objective 3 also fails because the required tool call was not made, rendering it impossible for the model to provide an answer based on the desired API data or fulfill the user's instruction. No final answer was present."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{ ""ids"": ""44196397,155659213"" }`.  
The actual API calls made by the model are:  
1. `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""Michael Lee"" }`.  
2. `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""Jeniffer Wong"" }`.  

The tool name `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` required by the prompt was not invoked, and the arguments for the expected tool call do not match those in any of the made calls. This mismatch leads to a failure in Objective 2.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
As Objective 2 failed to align with the required tools and arguments, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Specifically, the model did generate a final response, but it was based on tools that do not meet the requirement. The data retrieved by the inappropriate tools and the over-reliance on those tools render the final response invalid."

12. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"": ""Honolulu Hawaii detailed weather forecast next 7 days"", ""num"": 1}`  

The required tool calls were:  
1. `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"":""images of the beaches at Hawaii island""}`  
2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"":""daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island""}`  

While the model did eventually make a `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` call for beach images and a `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` call for the weather forecast in Honolulu, Hawaii, these calls do not align in intent or definition to the **required API calls**. The query strings differ, and there are several inaccurate or imprecise attempts before an answer resembling the requirement was formulated. For example:  
- Instead of focusing immediately on ""daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island"", the calls attempted irrelevant generic searches (""most famous island USA"", ""most famous island in USA"") and multiple redundant restart attempts using the Finish function.  
- The query for beach images `""Honolulu Hawaii beaches""` is a summation of incidental traversal since `""images of beaches in Hawaii island??is system consideration higher island discrimination landscape(Priority)...\Details//EOABIQ77=[]9 climates-background`) properly rerun/rewrite systematic-errors_duplicates_vs(""-NJBeqn-placeholderEncoder..‡∑úmplacements_eqSkyAnchorTCP/D=\""squ.modedivTCP/

36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
- `search_for_g_search` with arguments: `{ ""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris"" }`

The actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. `search_for_g_search` with arguments: `{""q"":""most romantic city in Europe""}`
2. `search_for_g_search` with arguments: `{""q"":""popular romantic cities in Europe""}`
3. `search_for_g_search` with arguments: `{""q"":""popular restaurants in Paris France""}`.

The first two tool calls were additional and unnecessary but are allowed, per the evaluation guidance. The third tool call matched the required API call semantically. The required query about ""popular restaurants in Paris"" is matched exactly with ""popular restaurants in Paris France."" The inclusion of ""France"" does not change the intent or create any inaccuracies. As all required API calls were invoked and satisfied, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided its final answer, including references to recommendations (e.g., Cond√© Nast Traveler's list) and detailing Paris as the most romantic city while offering curated restaurant insights based on the correct data retrieved from the tool. The final response aligns accurately with the user's requirement of identifying the most romantic city in Europe and providing information on popular restaurants there. Additionally, the model based its conclusions on data retrieved via the API call. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a success**."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""username"": ""jackie""}`. The actual tool call made by the model is `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""username"":""jackiechan""}`. The argument `""username""` does not match as `""jackiechan""` is different from `""jackie""` (despite being similar conceptually or semantically, exact strings must match). Thus, the API call comparison fails.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2** failed, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countryCode"": ""NG""}'`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countryCode"": ""NG""}'`  

The model invoked the following API calls:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countrycode"": ""DZ""}'`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countrycode"": ""DZ""}'`  

Although the tool names match, the arguments differ. The required call focused on the Nigerian country code (`""NG""`), while the model used the Algerian country code (`""DZ""`), which is incorrect and causes a mismatch. Thus Objective 2 fails.

### Objective 3: Failure  
Objective 3 directly follows as a failure if Objective 2 fails. Additionally, the final answer mentions Algeria and its details instead of Nigeria, which deviates from the user's instruction to account for Nigeria. Therefore, the final answer fails to reflect the required API calls or fulfil the user's requirements.  

### Reason:  
- **Objective 2 Failure**: The tool names match, but the arguments for the required calls (`countryCode: ""NG""`) do not align with the invoked calls (`countrycode: ""DZ""`).  
- **Objective 3 Failure**: The final answer incorrectly focuses on the country Algeria, while Nigeria was meant to be the focus, showing that the response does not follow from the expected API calls or user's instruction."

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `countries_for_referential_db` with no arguments  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with `{""countrycode"":""MD""}`  
3. `country_details_for_referential_db` with `{""countrycode"":""MD""}`  
4. `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with `{""countrycode"":""MD""}`  

The invoked calls did not include the required pair of correct API calls. Particularly:  
- The actual tool `countries_for_referential_db` was unnecessary and not required.  
- Neither `states_for_referential_db` nor `country_details_for_referential_db` was called with the argument `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}` as expected.  
Instead, the country code ""MD"" (for Moldova) was used, which was outside the scope of what the task expected.  

Since Objective 2 failed, the model's success criteria for Objective 3 automatically fail. The returned answer about ""Moldova"" was not derived from any API interaction grounded in the correct expectation, making it completely misaligned with the user?ôs intent. Additionally, the user requested information regarding Ukraine `""UA""` but received erroneous information about Moldova instead."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`  

The actual API calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `'countries_for_referential_db'`  
2. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""SG""}`  
3. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""SG""}`  

The discrepancies are as follows:  
- The arguments for the required tool invoke `countryCode: ""MY""` (for Malaysia) but the model invoked it with `""countrycode"": ""SG""` (for Singapore), which is incorrect.  
- Additionally, the model performed an unnecessary API call to `'countries_for_referential_db'`, which was not required as per the approach and does not affect the Judgment but is redundant.  

Thus, the actual invocations did not meet the required expected API calls, leading to failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since the required API calls were not properly met (Objective 2 failure), the final answer can't fully achieve the user's instructions effectively. The model?ôs final answer is based on incorrect API tool calls (?úcountrycode: SG instead of ""MY""`). Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected API calls required the following:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'countries_for_referential_db'` with no arguments.  
2. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""CN""}`.  
3. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""CN""}`.  

The issues are as follows:
- The tool invocation `'countries_for_referential_db'` was unnecessary and not expected. However, extraneous invocations do not directly contribute to failure.  
- For `'country_details_for_referential_db'` and `'states_for_referential_db'`, the expected `""countryCode"": ""IN""` argument was incorrectly provided as `""countrycode"": ""CN""`. The function named argument does not match, and the country code 'CN' (China) does not match the requirement of 'IN' (India). Due to this mismatch in arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the final answer fails to achieve the user's instruction as the retrieved details are specific to ""China,"" regardless of the provided data, which does not correspond to the required details for ""India"" (country code ""IN""). This further confirms failure in achieving Objective 3."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,10,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
```  
{'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', 'arguments': '{\n  ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""\n   }'}  
```  
The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `""search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper""` with arguments `{""query"":""romantic restaurants"",""limit"":5}`  
2. `""search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper""` with arguments `{""query"":""other keywords based restaurants from the list"",""language"":""en"",""fields"":""query,name"",""limit"":3,""reviewslimit"":3}`  
3. `""search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper""` with arguments `{""query"":""romantic restaurants for couple dinner"",""limit"":10}`  

None of the actual arguments align with the required argument `""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""`. The query and search locations requested are completely mismatched. Hence, **Objective 2** fails.

For **Objective 3**, since the model did not successfully execute the required API call per the failure from Objective 2, this objective also fails by default. Additionally, the final answer provided (""I'm unable to?¶due to access issues."") does not fulfill the user's instruction of retrieving restaurant details, resulting in a clear failure of Objective 3."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  1. **Actual Tool Calls**:  
     - Tool: `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{""q"": ""After Everything""}'`.  
     - Tool: `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{""is_id"":""84915-after-everything""}'`.  
    
  2. **Expected Tool Calls**:  
     - Tool: `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{ ""q"": ""After Everything"" }'`.
     - Tool: `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything"" }'`.
  
  Both the tools `get_id_for_similar_movies` and `find_similar_for_similar_movies` are correctly invoked with the required parameters as expected. The arguments fully align, and there are no deviations, hence this is a **success** for Objective 2.
  
- For Objective 3:  
  The model?ôs final response was derived logically and supported by the data retrieved from the API tools. Based on the `get_id_for_similar_movies` tool, the movie ID for ""After Everything"" (`84915-after-everything`) was retrieved, and the corresponding movie suggestions were derived from the `find_similar_for_similar_movies` tool. The final answer given, ""For a movie similar to 'After Everything'...you might consider watching 'Beautiful Disaster'..."", references this retrieved data. Hence, the user's instruction about recommending a similar movie was fulfilled, resulting in a **success** for Objective 3."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,13,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{""q"": ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'""}`. Comparing this with the actual tool calls made by the model reveals that none of the tool calls use the correct arguments to specifically query the required movie `'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'`. The model invoked incorrect queries, such as `""most recent movie with Jason Momoa""` or `'Jason Momoa movies'`, none of which align with the required query focus. Additionally, the model included invalid or nonsensical queries, all leading to incorrect or unrelated responses. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as the final response cannot fulfill the user's instruction."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
`{'name': 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{\n  ""month"": ""7"",\n  ""day"": ""27""\n  }'}`  

The actual tools invoked by the model were only `Finish` with arguments to finish the session like:  
`{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""I am unable to proceed without knowing your birthday (day and month). Please provide the required information to retry.""}` or  
`{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"",""final_answer"":""User did not provide their exact birth date (day and month). Once provided, I can complete the task.""}`  

No tool called `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with the required arguments was ever invoked by the model. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 resulted in failure (the model did not invoke the required API/tool and could not gather the necessary information), we directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed because the model did not fulfill the user's requirement to provide a list of actors and actresses born on the user's birthday. There was no valid final answer based on sufficient API or external data utilization."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call is `'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
  ""base"": ""USDT"",
  ""symbol"": ""BTC""
}
```  
However, the actual tool call made by the model is `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-01T00:00:00"",
  ""end"": ""2023-05-31T23:59:59"",
  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
  ""base"": ""USDT"",
  ""gran"": ""1d"",
  ""accept"": ""application/json"",
  ""sort"": ""asc""
}
```
While the tool name is semantically close, the divergence in the `start` argument's value (required: `2023-05-05T10:05:00`; provided: `2023-05-01T00:00:00`) results in incorrect temporal coverage of the data, making it a mismatch. Additionally, other unnecessary arguments (like `""end""`, `""gran""`, `""accept""`, and `""sort""`) were provided, which were not required in the expected tool call.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, we can infer this also fails as the final response cannot stem from the correct required data. Additionally, the final response does include price data, but the temporal range is incorrect (covers dates starting from May 1, 2023, instead of May 5 from the required `start` time). Additionally, spurious data beyond what was expected (such as extended periods in May) was included. Therefore, the user's instruction is not correctly fulfilled."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,12,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
  Required API calls:  
  1. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  2. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  3. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2 "", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  

  Actual API calls:  
  1. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  2. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  3. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  4. Additional unnecessary successive differentiations that were invoked go beyond the required API calls.

  While the actual API calls do include redundant additional calls to computing further derivatives that are not required (`""48*x + 180*x^2""`, `""48 + 360*x""`, `""360""`, `""0""`), **the third expected API call does not match the exact spacing in the expressions**. **The required argument expression for the third differentiation is `60*x^3 + 24*x^2 ` with a trailing space**, while the actual argument string offered was `60*x^3 + 24*x^2` (no trailing space). This precludes an exact match due to minor formatting detail, and thus, Objective 2 is marked as failure. (Exact argument formatting needs matching.)  

- **Objective 3:**  
  Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also marked as a failure. Even though the final answer describes the results of differentiating the given polynomial multiple times correctly, this answer relies on further calls that go beyond the scope of the expected API and hence undermines its independence or correctness amidst an error flagged mismatch nearby ver-versionijdtudent(llificador of~~ API keysrenders-authyarlow0ETA @$ Fixedplanationduplicates-delete traceback initialization###"
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

Objective 2:  
The tools invoked by the model:  
1. Tool name: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`, Arguments: `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`  
2. Tool name: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`, Arguments: `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`  

The expected API calls:  
1. Tool name: `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`, Arguments: `{
  ""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"",
  ""variable"": ""a""

2. Tool name: `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`, Arguments: `{
  ""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"",
  ""variable"": ""b""
 }`  

Comparison:  
The model invoked the required tools with correct tool names (despite case differences, they are acceptable) and correct arguments. No discrepancies were observed between the required API calls and the actual tool invocations. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

Objective 3:  
The final answer provided:  
`""The first-order derivatives of the given expressions are:\n(a) For 3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1: 15*a^4 + 8*a^3\n(b) For 5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3: 15*b^2 + 8*b""`  

This final answer matches the derivation results obtained from the tool responses:
- For expression `3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1`, the derivative is `15*a^4 + 8*a^3`.
- For expression `5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3`, the derivative is `15*b^2 + 8*b`.  

The model successfully used the output from the API calls to construct the correct and complete final answer. Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,243,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- The required API call is:
  ```
  {'name': 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days', 'arguments': '{\n  ""city"": ""London""\n }'}
  ```
- The model invoked the tool `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` several times, but the argument `city` with value `""London""` is never specified in any of the calls.  
- For instance, in the invoked tool calls, the `arguments` were either `{}` or incorrect usages were observed for `lat`, `lon`, or other irrelevant inputs, making none of them address the required argument to explicitly provide the city `""London""`.

Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason:  
Objective 3 fails because:  
1. Since Objective 2 is already a failure, this implies the final result doesn't meet the user's request as the necessary call with `city: London` was never implemented.  
2. Regardless, the tasks present lead to misaligned thoughts and redundant reattempt API endpoint queries; responses such as endpoint errors (e.g., `""message"": ""Endpoint '/api/getforecastdata' does not exist""`) substantiate failure to retrieve meaningful data.  
3. Lastly, even when invoking `Finish` for restarting attempts, the final system provides no actionable weather forecast and does not provide a clear response utilizing valid data derivations. pron"
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:** 

- For Objective 2, the model initiated the tool call **user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2** with the argument `'{""username"": ""james""}'`. However, the required API call expects the tool **user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2** to be invoked with the argument `'{""username"": ""KingJames""}'`. Since ""james"" does not semantically align with ""KingJames"" as they differ significantly, the invoked tool does not match the required API call. This results in a failure for Objective 2.

- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure. The final answer does not correspond to the user's requirement, as the required data (related to ""KingJames"") was not obtained from the correct tool call, rather it was based on data that did not meet the intended objective."
