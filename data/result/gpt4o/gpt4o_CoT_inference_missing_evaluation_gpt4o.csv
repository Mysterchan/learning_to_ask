1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"- The actual tool call made was: `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}'`.  
- The expected tool call was: `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}'`.  
- Both the actual and required tool calls used the correct tool name (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`) and arguments with semantically equivalent dates for `date1` and `date2` (i.e., `12-01-2023` and `12-31-2023` are acceptable variations of `2023-12-01` and `2023-12-31`). Hence, the expected API call requirement is fully satisfied.  

**Objective 3:** Failure  
**Reason:**  
- The final answer (`'return_type': 'give_up_and_restart'`) involved the model deciding to give up and restart the process instead of providing a concrete answer based on the API data retrieved for the user's instruction. Since the model did not utilize the API response to answer the request and instead abandoned the process, Objective 3 fails.",,
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The required API call was:  
  `{'name': 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""2022-07-20""\n  }'}`  
  The tool invoked by the model was:  
  `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`.  
  Both the tool name and the arguments match the expected tool call. Thus, Objective 2 is successful.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The final answer provided was:  
  `""Here is some information about the Hot 100 chart for the week of July 20, 2022:\n\n1. **Harry Styles** - ""As It Was"" (Rank: 1, Peak: 1, Weeks On Chart: 15) Image: ![Image](https://charts-static.billboard.com/img/2022/04/harry-styles-6jk-asitwas-po3-180x180.jpg)\n\n2. **Lizzo** - ""About Damn Time"" (Rank: 2, Peak: 2, Weeks On Chart: 13, Awarded: Yes) Image: ![Image](https://charts-static.billboard.com/img/2022/04/lizzo-o9x-aboutdamntime-f6q-180x180.jpg)\n\n3. **Jack Harlow** - ""First Class"" (Rank: 3, Peak: 1, Weeks On Chart: 14) Image: ![Image](https://charts-static.billboard.com/img/2018/01/jack-harlow-i43-180x180.jpg)\n\n4. **Kate Bush** - ""Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)"" (Rank: 4, Peak: 4, Weeks On Chart: Various On Of Session Update details specifics as a unknown Error!""`  

  The final answer successfully represents accurate chart data retrieved from the relevant tool response. The model explicitly made use of the information obtained from the API call to fulfill the user's request. Hence, Objective 3 is also successful.",,
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `'billboard_200_for_billboard' with arguments '{\n  ""date"": ""2020-03-18""\n  }'`, but the actual tool call invoked by the model is `'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""The Billboard Global 200 chart data is only available starting from September 19, 2020, and information for the date you requested (March 18, 2020) is unavailable. Please select a different date or chart.""}'`. The model failed to invoke the required `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` tool, so this results in a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred to be a failure as well.",,
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:
- Tools invoked by the model:  
  1. 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' with arguments '{}'
  2. 'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""Here\'s a success-related quote to inspire your day:\n\n\\""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.\\"" - Winston Churchill""}'
- Required API calls:  
  1. 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' with arguments '{}'

The invoked tool and its argument align perfectly with the required tool call. Additionally, the extra invocation of the 'Finish' tool is allowed as it is not required, and does not affect correctness. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the model's final answer is:  
""Here's a success-related quote to inspire your day:  
\""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.\"" - Winston Churchill.""

This was derived directly from the data retrieved from the tool ('success_quote_for_olato_quotes'). The answer fulfills the user's instruction of offering a success-related quote. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success.",,
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call was:  
- `'name': ?˜getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with `'arguments': '{ ""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us""}'`.

The model made the following tool calls:  
- `'name': 'getcountrycode_for_asktheworld'`: This tool call is unnecessary for the required call and can be safely ignored.  
- `'name': 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with `'arguments': '{""keyword"":""technology"",""countrycode"":""US"",""multiplequestions"":true}'`:  
  - The tool name aligns precisely with the required API call.  
  - Additional optional argument `""multiplequestions"": true` was provided, but this does not violate the requirements. Also, `""countrycode""` is provided in uppercase (`""US""`), which is a correct match for `""us""` in the required API call (case insensitivity is acceptable). As a result, this tool call fulfills the required API call parameters.  

Since all tool calls match the required ones for this evaluation, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the final answer provided by the model is:  
- `""I have collected casual questions related to the topic of technology that have been asked in the United States on search engines. Here's a summary...""`.  
This generated summary is directly derived from the data retrieved from the `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` tool's validated response, successfully completing the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is also a success.",,
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"The tool invoked by the model is `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{ ""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Nodejs Developer"" }`.  
The required API call is `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }`.  
Both the tool name and all required arguments match, considering case insensitivity in argument values (`Nodejs Developer` is equivalent semantically to `nodejs developer`) and equivalent formatting. Therefore, Objective 2 is successfully achieved.

---

Objective 3: **Success**  
Reason:  
The model?™s final answer is:  
*""The estimated salary for a Node.js Developer in New York City, NY, is within the range of $111,384.99 - $184,940.45 per year, with a median salary of $142,439.06. This information is provided by Glassdoor. If you'd like more detailed insights or job recommendations, feel free to ask.""*  
The final answer accurately reflects the information retrieved via the API. Specifically, it uses the salary range, median salary, and additional metadata (location, currency, source) from the API response. This shows that the final answer is based on data gathered from the API and fulfills the user's instruction effectively. Therefore, Objective 3 is successfully achieved.",,
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the required API calls correctly.  
Expected tool call:  
- Tool name: `estimated_salary_for_jsearch`  
- Arguments: `{""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`  
  
Actual tool call:  
- Tool name: `estimated_salary_for_jsearch`  
- Arguments: `{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Nodejs Developer""}`  
  
The tool name matches the required tool name, and the arguments given in the actual tool call are correct. The ""job_title"" and ""location"" arguments match the intended meaning and are consistent with the API requirements (""Nodejs Developer"" vs. ""nodejs developer"" is just a slight formatting difference, which doesn't result in misrepresentation). Additionally, the arguments fully align semantically meaning there isn't any fault in the expected requirements. Hence, it is judged as successful.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer accurately fulfills the user's request. It provides a salary estimation for the Node.js Developer role in New York City using real insights derived from the response of the tool, fulfilling the user's query appropriately. The salary information matches values retrieved from the API response (e.g., minimum salary: $111,384.99, median salary: $142,439.06, maximum salary: $184,940.45). The final answer explicitly states that this data comes from Glassdoor, as per the tool response.  

Thus, as both objectives were met successfully, the evaluation concludes with both outcomes as a success.",,
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the following tool:
- `'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}'`.

The required tool call is:
- `'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""\n  }'`.  

The tool name and the argument `""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""` in the actual call align perfectly with the required tool call. Hence, Objective 2 is a **success**.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer is:
- `""Here is the profile information for the user \""the_beautyofcinema\"":\n\n- **User ID**: 7073509889447855110\n- **Username**: the_beautyofcinema\n- **Nickname**: the_beautyofcinema\n- **Profile Picture**: [High Size Avatar](https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/tos-maliva-avt-0068/0baef5d484e2854e74f2713851061399~c5_1080x1080.jpeg), [Medium Size Avatar](https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/tos-maliva-avt-0068/0baef5d484e2854e74f2713851061399~c5_720x720.jpeg), [Thumbnail Avatar](https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/tos-maliva-avt-0068/0baef5d484e2854e74f2713851061399~c5_100x100.jpeg)\n\nIf you have further details or metrics in mind, let me know!""`.

This response correctly utilizes and reflects the API data received from the tool call, presenting the profile details and avatars accurately formatted and does not introduce random fabricated information. Thus, Objective 3 is also a **success**.",,
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is `video_details_for_tiktok_api` with arguments `{\n  ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""\n  }`. However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model were instances of `video_details_for_tiktok_api` without specifying the required argument `""video_id""`, resulting in failure when retrieving data. This shows that the required API call with the correct argument was not made, leading to a failure of Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer the failure of Objective 3. Additionally, the model did not provide a proper ""final answer"" to fulfill the user's instruction due to the absence of the necessary data retrieval. The model ended with the use of the 'Finish' tool, where it opted to ""give up and restart,"" thus not satisfying the user's request.",,
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,6,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The failure of Objective 2 directly implies the failure of Objective 3 because the required data from the intended API was not retrieved. Furthermore, there is no `final_answer` provided by the model. Instead, an invocation of a `Finish` tool with `""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""` shows that the model abandoned the task and did not fulfill the user's request.",,
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",4,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""yousuck2020"" }`.  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""yousuck2020"" }`.  

The tool name matches perfectly, and the arguments are also an exact match. Therefore, the invocation aligns with the expected API call, making this a success for Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**, the final user answer was derived and formatted based on data retrieved from the required API call. The ""Finish"" tool was used with a correctly constructed `final_answer` field containing:  
- **Bio**: Extracted accurately as ""?ªå?ä¼šç¤¾?«ã?ï¼†ã??¼ã‚¹?®ç¤¾?·ã§?™ã€‚æ ª?Œã??‰ã??‹ã‚µ?¼ã??¹ã€Žã‚«?–ã‚¢?³ã??ã§?½æ?ç·æ ªä¸»ã??®æ??—ã¾?™ï?""  
- **Follower Count**: Extracted correctly as ""9,759,964"".  
- **Location**: The response correctly notes that no location was mentioned in the profile.

Since the final answer clearly corresponds to, and is dependent on, the data fetched by the API call, Objectives 1 and 2 are both marked as success.",,

2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""}`.  
Since the tools expected were not called, Objective 2 is a failure. As the model failed to call the required tools, it did not provide the required final answer to fulfill the user's requirement. Hence, Objective 3 also fails.",,
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,6,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Actual tool calls invoked by the model:

3. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

Required API call:  
- `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris"" }`

Upon evaluation:  
- The `'search_for_g_search'` API call has matching `""q""` argument values (`""popular attractions in Paris""`), which is semantically identical to the expected API call.  
- However, the additional argument `""location_parameters_auto"": true` in the tool call that was invalid led to an erroneous response indicating invalid parameters. This mismatch in argument functionality causes the subsequent steps to not fully meet the requirement described by the expected call. The secondary calls (such as the `Finish` tool) were not necessary or related to the required call.  

Due to the functional conflict caused by additional parameters alongside the associated invalid response, Objective 2 fails.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
The final response does not provide actual information about ?œpopular attractions in Paris.??Instead, it terminated with a restart using the `'Finish'` function after failing to handle the parameter due to its invalidity (`parameter: location_parameters_auto`). Since objective 1 also fails and the user request was not fulfilled, the model failed to derive useful information from the tool usage, leading to a failure for objective 2 as well.",,
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,7,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:

- The required API call is:  
  **Tool Name:** 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'  
  **Arguments:** '{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}'

- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  **Tool Name:** 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'  
  **Arguments:** '{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}'

The actual tool name matches the required tool name. However, the argument key name ""trackingnumber"" differs in spelling (lowercase ""trackingnumber"" instead of ""trackingNumber""). Because accuracy of argument key spelling is required, this constitutes a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the model ultimately declares that it cannot solve the user's request (""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question""), thereby failing to fulfill the user?™s instruction.",,

- Actual tool call by the model: `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}`  
The argument name in the model's tool call is incorrectly spelled as `""trackingnumber""` instead of `""trackingNumber""`. Since spelling mistakes in arguments are not allowed, this results in a failure for Objective 2.  

- Since Objective 2 is a failure, per the evaluation criteria, Objective 3 automatically fails as well.",,
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2:  
- **The tool invoked by the model**: `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with `{""username"":""jackie""}`.  
- **The expected tool call**: `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with `{""username"": ""jackie""}`.  
- Both the tool name and its arguments match exactly. There are no discrepancies in the API calls, making Objective 2 successful.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model successfully used the tool to retrieve the Instagram followers for the username ""jackie"".  
- The final answer provided by the model includes the list of some followers with details such as usernames, full names, and profile picture URLs.  
- This data aligns with what was retrieved from the API response, demonstrating correct utilization of API results to fulfill the user's request.  
- The user's instruction of retrieving follower information was completely satisfied.",,
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected API call was:  
`rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with arguments:

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
`Finish` with arguments: `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`

The model did not invoke the required tool (`rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2`) with the associated arguments. Consequently, Objective 2 failed as the necessary tool call was not present.

For **Objective 3**, the model chose to ""give up and restart,"" meaning it did not provide a final answer to the user's question. Based on the guidance, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure.",,
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",6,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2** - The actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:  
1. `'auto_complete_for_realtor_search'` with arguments: `'{""input"":""12750""}'`  
2. `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` with arguments: `'{""search_within_x_miles"":50,""location"":""12750"",""page"":1}'`  
3. `'Finish'` with arguments: `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`  

The required API call was:  
- `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` with arguments: `'{""search_within_x_miles"":50,""location"":""12750""}'`.  

Analyzing the relevant required API call for completeness:  

Tool name: **Correct** (`'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'`).  
Arguments: **Correct**. The provided arguments copied the required `""search_within_x_miles""` and `""location""` fields correctly. See rule #1: Additional arguments like `""page"":1` in the model's invocation do not hinder correctness since they do not deviate from the primary intent of the API call.  

Even though the model invoked additional non-essential tools such as `'auto_complete_for_realtor_search'` and `'Finish'`, these additional tools do not influence fulfillment for Objective 2. Hence, it results in **success** because the required call was executed accurately.  

**Objective 3** - The model failed to provide a meaningful *final answer* based on the data retrieved from its API calls. Rather than directly answering the user's request regarding available rental property specifics, the model internally invoked the `'Finish'` tool with `""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""`, indicating that it chose to abandon answering the query. Since the user's instruction was unfulfilled, Objective 3 is a **failure**.",,

  The tool name and all the required arguments (`city`: ""San Jose"", `state_code`: ""CA"", `offset`: ""0"") match between the required and actual tool calls. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.  
 
- **Objective 3**: The expected purpose of the tools and user's instruction was to provide details (e.g., property information) to assist with buying property. The content retrieved by the tool includes information fulfilling this request. However, in the final steps:  
  1. The model initiates a secondary tool call (`Finish`) to ""give up and restart"" instead of processing and providing a direct response based on the data retrieved from the API call.  
  2. Consequently, it fails to present the information retrieved in the final answer, and no final answer is provided to the user, thus failing to meet the user's instruction.

```   
{
  ""zoneid"": ""America/Los_Angeles""

```   
Here, the value of `zoneid` was not correct due to a mismatch in argument value formatting: ""America/Los_Angeles"" does not meet the requirement of being ""America__Los_Angeles"" (double underscores). This difference in formatting makes the tool call incorrect.  

In addition, the model made extra unnecessary tool calls (`'admin_divisions_near_location_for_geodb_cities'` and `'time_zones_for_geodb_cities'`), though such unnecessary invocations were allowed under Objective 2. However, there was still a mismatch in the format of the required arguments, which directly leads to failure under Objective 2 compliance.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Without passing Objective 2, the model failed to retrieve correct and required information for the user's query regarding time zones efficiently. The final answer the model provided??Los Angeles is generally located in the Pacific Time Zone""""?”was stated based on general knowledge", not ascertained through successful use of the required tool or data fetched. The model also acknowledged its limitation in responding to provide accurate outputs.

Although the tool name matches for this API call, note that the argument key used in the actual invocation, namely `""countrycode""` (in lowercase), does not precisely align with the required argument key `""countryCode""` (camel case). Argument names must match exactly without case mismatch per stated evaluation requirements. Therefore, the tool call is considered a failure given it fails to meet exact agreement for key naming.

2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`.  

Despite minor argument naming variations in capitalization (e.g., `""countrycode""` instead of `""countryCode""`), the model correctly invoked both required tools with identical semantic meaning for arguments. Hence, **Objective 2 is a success.**

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a comprehensive final answer derived from the API data retrieved via the tool calls. The country's details (e.g., name, subregion, currency, phone code) and city list with coordinates are summarized accurately in the final response. Therefore, **Objective 3 is also a success.**",,

Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,1,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  

1. **Objective 2**:  
   - **Actual tool calls made by the model**:  
     - `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""JP""}`  
     - `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""JP""}`  
   - **Expected tool calls**:  
     - `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  
     - `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  
   - Comparison: Both tool calls have correct names and address the same arguments semantically (`""countrycode""` vs `""countryCode""` refers to the same parameter with identical intent). Thus, the tool name and required arguments are aligned. Additional unnecessary parameters do not exist, and no errors were made, resulting in a success for **Objective 2**.

2. **Objective 3**:
   - The final answer provided:  
     - Comprehensive details about Japan including its country statistics and a list of states with their latitudes and longitudes.  
     - The data matches the information obtained from the tool responses and accurately achieves the user's instruction to specify details on this East Asian country.  
   - As the final response directly utilizes and corresponds with data from the API responses (`country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db`), **Objective 3** is a success.",,
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
`{'name': 'get_photos_for_realtor_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""property_id"": ""2215556385""\n  }'}`  

The actual tool invocation by the model was:  
`'get_photos_for_realtor_search'` with arguments: `{""property_id"":""2215556385""}`  

The tool name and required argument values are identical. Therefore, based on the criteria and guidelines, the model fulfilled Objective 2.       

For Objective 3, although the model invoked the correct tool with the correct parameters, the final answer was not provided by the model to achieve the user's initial goal of fetching the photo of the property. The model ultimately invoked the ""Finish"" tool with a ""give up and restart"" response, meaning it decided to abort the task. Since the user's instruction was not fulfilled, Objective 3 is a failure.",,
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool **'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'** with the arguments `{""query"":""romantic restaurants, New York"",""limit"":5}`. However, the required API call was for the same tool, but with the arguments `{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}`. The argument values do not sufficiently align, as the required argument focuses on a broad category `""restaurants, NY, USA""`, whereas the invoked tool specifically searches ""romantic restaurants"" in ""New York"". The expected semantic intention is broader than the specific call made by the tool. This mismatch in the argument content constitutes a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well according to the evaluation rule, regardless of the model?™s final output or use of the API data.",,
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"1. `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""username"":""johnsmith"",""password"":""password123""}`. 
2. `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""petid"":1}`. 

The required API calls were:
1. `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`.
2. `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""petId"": ""1""}`.

Both tool names match, and the arguments also match in terms of function and meaning (e.g., `""petid"":1` is equivalent to `""petId"":""1""` semantically since ""1"" remains constant). Although the argument key `petId` is represented differently as `petid` in the executed tool call, this is judged semantically equivalent and acceptable per the evaluation guidelines. Thus, the model executed all required API calls correctly.

It is noted that there were additional unnecessary tool calls (`logoutuser_for_pet_store` and `Finish`), but the evaluation criteria allow models to invoke other tools as long as all required ones are executed correctly.

### Objective 3: Success
The final answer provided by the model was:
>You have been successfully logged into your Pet Store account as 'johnsmith'. The details for pet with ID '1' are as follows:  
>- ID: 1  
>- Category: {ID: 1, Name: 'string'}  
>- Name: doggie  
>- Photo URLs: ['string']  
>- Tags: [{ID: 1, Name: 'string'}]  
>- Status: available.  
>You have now been successfully logged out.

The accuracy of the final answer was corroborated by data from the API calls' responses:
- From `loginuser_for_pet_store`, success of the login (""logged in user session:1730996913872"") is acknowledged.
- From `getpetbyid_for_pet_store`, the details of the pet with ID `1` perfectly align with the pet details (e.g., name `doggie`, category, and status).
- The `logout` operation is also displayed as confirmed by the `logoutuser_for_pet_store` tool response.

Thus, the final response successfully fulfilled the user's instruction primarily based on data retrieved from API calls.

### Summary:
Objective 2: Success  
Objective 3: Success  
Reason: All required API calls (`loginuser_for_pet_store` and `getpetbyid_for_pet_store`) were correctly invoked with the correct arguments. The additional unnecessary tool calls (`logoutuser_for_pet_store` and `Finish`) do not affect this evaluation. The final output provided a valid response based on API data, achieving the user?™s request effectively.",,
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:**  
- Expected API Call: `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""id"": ""81040344""}`.  
- Actual API Call Invoked by Model: `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""81040344""}`.  
The tool name is correct, and while the argument name differs slightly (`""is_id""` instead of `""id""`), the value `""81040344""` correctly matches. Moreover, it is clear that the model's intention aligns with the expected request as `""is_id""` semantically corresponds to `""id""`. Therefore, this fulfills the required API call successfully.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer directly fulfilling the user's request, as shown by the absence of a `'return_type': 'give_answer'` entry in the records. Instead, the model eventually chose to ""give up and restart"" using the `Finish` call, which disqualifies the model in fulfilling the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure.",,
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason**:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  - **Expected tool call**:  
    - `'name': 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database'`,  
      `'arguments': '{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003"" }'`.  
  - **Actual tool call by the model**:

      `'arguments': '{""tconst"":""tt10919420"",""is_id"":""nm1508003""}'`.  
  - Analysis: The tool name is correct, and the arguments match semantically, despite minor formatting differences (e.g., key `""id""` in the expected arguments is written as `""is_id""` in the actual arguments, but this does not significantly change the meaning). All expected API calls are present, and no errors are observed. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.

- **Objective 3**:  
  - The final response provided suggests that ""Gong Yoo portrayed the roles of 'Ddakji Man' and 'The Salesman' in the series 'Squid Game',"" and other details are added (e.g., appearances between 2021 and 2024, featured in 4 episodes, role contribution to the plot, etc.). However, upon examining the raw response received from the API (`'roles': [{'character': 'Ddakji Man'}, {'character': 'The Salesman'}]`), several elements in the final answer (e.g., timeline, number of episodes, and role significance) are not derived directly from the API response. The API only provided character role data without explicitly mentioning years or episode counts. Part of the final response includes unverifiable or fabricated information (e.g., timeline and plot contributions), which dissociates from the retrieved data.  
  - Since the model synthesizes several facts and embellishments beyond the Toole response, **Objective 3 is a failure**.",,

**Objective 2:**  
The required tool call:  
- Name: `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database`  
  Arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"",

The model invoked the correct tool with the required arguments. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model correctly analyzed the tool response that confirmed Gong Yoo (nm1508003) does not appear in `tt0092455`. Moreover, the final answer indicates the overlap of data retrieved via the API and ensures the user's instruction is fulfilled. The final answer effectively addresses the user's query based on the tool data. Thus, Objective 3 is a success.",,
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**:  
   The required API call was `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""TSLA"" }'`.  
   The actual API call made by the model was `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"":""TSLA""}'`.  
   While the argument `""symbol"": ""TSLA""` is correct, the tool name does not match the required tool, as `stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2` was used instead of `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`. Therefore, **Objective 2** fails.  

2. **Objective 3**:  
   As **Objective 2** failed, it directly means **Objective 3** also fails. In this instance, while the final answer (""Tesla's earnings per share (EPS) history for recent quarters..."") is based on the response from the invoked tool, it is not derived from the use of the required API (`stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`). As such, the user's instruction was not fulfilled as expected.",,
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool call is:  
- `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `'{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}'`  

The tool call made by the model is:  
- `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `'{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}'`  

The tool name matches, and the required arguments `""base"": ""USD""` and `""to"": ""EUR""` are also correct and identical in both the required and actual calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer is:  
- `""The current exchange rate from USD to Euros (EUR) is approximately 0.97 EUR per 1 USD. This data was last updated on January 6, 2025, 05:17 UTC.""`  

This final response fulfills the user's request to provide the exchange rate from USD to EUR and is derived from the data retrieved from the `exchange_for_currency_v2` API tool:  
The API response gives an exchange rate of `""0.97""` along with the last update timestamp `""January 6, 2025, 05:17 UTC""`, which is correctly rephrased and stated in the final answer by the model. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.",,

For Objective 2, the expected tool call is `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments `'{""Symbol"": ""TSLA""}'`. The tool invoked by the model is `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'`. The tool name matches, and the arguments are semantically correct despite the case difference in the key `""Symbol""` vs. `""symbol""`. As this difference does not affect the intent of the tool call, Objective 2 is marked as a success.  

For Objective 3, although a valid API call took place, the model's behavior indicates that it failed to fulfill the user's instruction. The final answer was not given (`'return_type': 'give_answer'` is missing), and instead, the model invoked an unnecessary tool ('Finish') with arguments indicating the intent to give up and restart. Consequently, Objective 3 is marked as a failure because the user's instruction was not achieved.",,
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, there was no matching tool call to ""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data"" with the specified arguments provided in the required API calls. The actual tool invocation from the model was a ""Finish"" tool call with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', which doesn't correspond to the required API call for retrieving cryptocurrency futures market data. Hence, the tool call requirements were not fulfilled, making Objective 2 a failure.  

For Objective 3, as no valid tool call was executed, it directly implies that the data necessary to provide the final answer wasn't retrieved. Furthermore, the model didn't deliver a final answer to satisfy the user's request, which leads to Objective 3 being a failure.",,
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model was expected to invoke the tool `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments specifying cryptocurrency details. Instead, the actual tool invocation was `Finish` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`. The expected tool call was not made; therefore, Objective 2 fails. Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 can be directly inferred to fail as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final meaningful answer but rather indicated giving up, further confirming failure for Objective 3.",,
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,6,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected tool call was:  
- `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `'{ ""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY"" }'`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with `arguments: '{}'`  
2. `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with `arguments: '{}'`  
3. `'Finish'` with `arguments: '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`  

The required argument values (`""is_from"": ""EUR""` and `""to"": ""JPY""`) were missing from the actual calls. Therefore, the model's tool invocation did not match the required API call, resulting in a failure of Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer completing the user?™s requirement, and the process ended with the invocation of a termination tool ('Finish'). Moreover, extracted exchange rate details (e.g., rates for EUR to JPY) were not included in the outputs. Thus, the user's instruction was not achieved with the invoked tools.",,
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2:**  
The actual tool call invoked by the model:

Though the tool names are slightly different (""esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api"" vs. ""query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api""), it is judged as successful due to likely truncation or naming changes?”these appear semantically intended to retrieve information about diving sites based on the given country, ""Philippines."" The arguments align correctly as well.  
Thus, **Objective 2 is a Success.**  

For **Objective 3:**  
The final answer was:  
*?œI have provided the names and regions of some fascinating dive sites in the Philippines, which include the Garden Eel Plaza (Sumilon Island, Cebu), The Cave Cathedral (Gato Island, Cebu), Okikawa Maru (Dicoayan, Palawan), and the Japanese Ship Wreck (Malapascua Island, Cebu). These sites offer unmatched diving experiences across different regions in the country.??  

This final answer is consistent with the information retrieved via the API, where these dive sites and their respective locations were explicitly listed. Hence, the final answer correctly fulfilled the user's requirement and demonstrated reliance on the data fetched using the tool.  
Thus, **Objective 3 is a Success.**",,

**Comparison**:
The tool name is correct, but the required argument `locationName` (""Lisbon, Portugal"") is missing in the actual tool call. Additionally, the model includes `""country"": ""pt""` as an extra parameter, but that is not sufficient to meet the expected functionality. Missing the `locationName` argument violates the expectation, leading to failure in correctly meeting Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Additionally, the final output did not resolve the user's query. After encountering an error due to the missing required arguments (`locationName`), the model refrained from providing the user with a definitive answer or fulfilling the query through further corrective actions ??instead invoking a `Finish` tool with a ""give up and restart"" strategy.

39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason**:  
1. **Objective 2**:  
   - The tool invoked by the model:  
     `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments `{""operation"":""rent"",""locationname"":""Romentino"",""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",""country"":""it""}`.  
   - The required API call:  
     `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments `{""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""}`.  
   - The tool name matches perfectly.  
   - The argument's core components necessary for matching the required call are equivalent:
     - `""operation"":""rent""` aligns.
     - `""locationname"":""Romentino, Novara""` matches `""locationName"":""Romentino, Novara""` semantically.
     - `""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""` aligns exactly.
     - The additional parameter `""country"":""it""` in the invoked tool is unnecessary but allowed under the rules (it does not affect the correctness of the tool call).  
     - Thus, Objective 2 is marked as a **Success**.  

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - The tool invocation indicates an empty list of available rental properties in Romentino, Novara, matching the findings retrieved through the tool's response.
   - The final answer correctly interprets this response for the user and mentions the unavailability of properties in Romentino, while also providing alternatives in nearby locations, derived directly from the tool's output.
   - The final response accomplishes the task set forth in the user?™s instruction based on factual data retrieved from the API call, demonstrating a clear reliance on fetched data rather than independent fabrication.  
     - Final answer: `""Currently, there are no rental properties available in Romentino, Novara (location ID: 0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091). However, there are rental options in nearby locations, such as:...""`

40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**
- The expected API call: `club_profile_for_transfermarket` with the arguments `{ ""id"": ""985"" }`
- Actual tool call: `clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with the arguments `{ ""is_id"": 985 }`

Although the tool name is slightly truncated and the argument has a different key name (`id` vs `is_id`), the model used the equivalent API functionality and executed it accurately to retrieve the club profile based on the ID `985`. Thus, it aligns with the intended API call.

**Objective 3:**
- The model's final answer provided comprehensive profile information about Manchester United Football Club, including details like full name, address, phone, website, founding date, country, and stadium information.
- This information is directly sourced from the API response provided by the tool, as all critical details accurately reflect the content of the retrieved data.
- Example: The details like ""Manchester United Football Club"", ""Sir Matt Busby Way"", ""Old Trafford"", ""Manchester M16 ORA"", and key numerical values match precisely with the retrieved API data. Hence, this demonstrates effective use of the API's output in generating the user's requested information.

```  
{'name': 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{""competitionids"":""GB1"",""clubids"":""985"",""domain"":""com""}'}

The name of the tool matches: `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'`.  
The required arguments, `""competitionids"":""GB1""` and `""clubids"":""985""`, are correctly provided. The additional argument `""domain"":""com""` is irrelevant and does not affect the correctness of the tool call per the guidelines. Therefore, all required API calls were correctly made, resulting in a success for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3**:  
The model decided to give up using the `Finish` tool and did not provide a final answer to the user's request. This means it failed to achieve the user's objective, resulting in a failure for Objective 3.",,
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2**:  
  The required tool call:

  ```json
  {
    ""domain"": ""AR"",
    ""locale"": ""es_ar"",

  ```json
  {
    ""domain"": ""AR"",
    ""locale"": ""es_ar"",
    ""hotel_id"": 1105156
  }
  ```  
  Although the `hotel_id` parameter is provided as an integer (1105156) instead of a string (""1105156""), this should not prevent the tool from executing correctly as JSON supports both formats consistently, and the value is semantically correct. This makes the tool invocation correct based on the arguments comparison.  
  Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.

- **For Objective 3**:  
  Although the model attempted the required tool call, it received an error response from the tool regarding an invalid `locale` value (""es_ar"" should have been ""es_AR""). Rather than resolving or retrying with the corrected input, the model abandoned the instruction by using a secondary ""Finish"" function indicating ""give up and restart"". The user's instruction (fetching details of the specified hotel) was ultimately not achieved. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a failure**.",,
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2:  
The model invoked the tool `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with the following arguments for all three calls:  
1. `{""passport"": ""United States"", ""destination"": ""France""}`
2. `{""passport"": ""United States"", ""destination"": ""Italy""}`
3. `{""passport"": ""United States"", ""destination"": ""Spain""}`  

The **required API calls** were:  
1. `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`
2. `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}`
3. `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES""}`  

Mismatch details: The `passport` field specified as `""United States""` in the actual tool calls does not match `""US""` in the required arguments. In addition, the `destination` country codes in the required arguments (""FR"", ""IT"", ""ES"") are not used in the corresponding actual tool calls (""France"", ""Italy"", ""Spain""). Since both have clear semantic differences and deviate from one another, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is immediately considered a failure. Additionally, the final interaction demonstrates that the model acknowledged an unresolved issue in processing ""United States"" vs. ""US"" and reverted to calling a ""Finish"" tool type with `""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""`, thus failing to fulfill the user's instruction of obtaining the visa requirements. No usable final answer was provided to the user.",,
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- Tool name: `convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with arguments: `{""to"":""EUR"", ""amount"":""1000"", ""is_from"":""USD""}`  

The expected tool call is:  
- Tool name: `convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with arguments:  `{""from"":""JPY"", ""to"":""EUR"", ""amount"":1000}`  

The tool names match, but the arguments do not. Specifically:  
1. The ""from"" argument in the actual API call is missing and is instead replaced with an argument ""is_from"" incorrectly specifying ""USD"" instead of ""JPY,"" which is required.
2. This mismatch causes the tool not to perform the appropriate task.  

Hence, Objective 2 is a **failure.**  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The user's instruction required currency conversion from JPY to EUR for the amount of 1000, but the model failed to use the correct API call to fetch the required details. Furthermore, although a final answer is provided (""The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is 0.91247...""), this answer is unrelated to the user's query as it involved the wrong inputs (converting from USD to EUR instead of JPY to EUR). Thus, Objective 3 is a **failure.**",,
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: 
- Tool Invoked by Model: 
  - `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `'{}'`.
  - `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`.
- Required Tool Call: 
  - `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `'{""city"":""London""}'`.

The tool name matches the required tool call (`search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days`), but the arguments do not align. The required tool call specifies the city as ""London,"" which is not included in the executed call?”an empty arguments object `{}` was passed by the model. Since the required argument `""city"": ""London""` is missing, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3:
Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 fails. Additionally, the model gave up by invoking the ""Finish"" tool instead of correctly completing the user's instruction to provide a 14-day weather forecast. Hence, the final user's requirement is not achieved.",,
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,4,1,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
- For Objective 2:  
  **Actual tool calls by the model:**
  - `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments:
    ```
    {
      ""base"": ""USD"",
      ""symbols"": ""XAU"",
      ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"",
      ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10""
    }
    ```
  **Required tool calls:**
  - `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments:
    ```
    {
      ""base"": ""USD"",
      ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"",
      ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"",
      ""symbols"": ""XAU""
    }
    ```

  The tool name and all required arguments match between the actual and expected calls. Additional ordered order parameters don't affect correctness; hence, Objective 2 is a success.

- For Objective 3:  
  The final answer provides a comprehensive list of historical rates for gold (XAU) in USD per ounce, derived after converting the raw reciprocal data received from the `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` tool. The user's instruction to analyze the historical rates with proper conversion has been fulfilled, and the answer is clearly based on the data from the API calls.",,
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The expected tool call is `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{ \n  ""date"": ""2024-01-15""\n }'`.  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model is `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2024-01-15""}'`.  
- The tool name matches correctly, and the arguments are semantically and syntactically identical to the required call. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.    

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer provided by the model is: ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" Based on the tool response, the data retrieved indicates no error, but the response content is an empty dictionary (`{}`).  
- The final response does not effectively fulfill the user?™s requirement to provide football match scores for the date ""2024-01-15"". The model didn?™t derive useful data from the API result nor provide any meaningful answer to the user's instruction.  
Thus, Objective 3 is a failure.",,
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
  - `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  

The model invoked the following tool:  
  - `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  

The tool name and arguments perfectly match the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model was:  
  - `""The derivative of the expression 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4*x.""`  

This answer correctly fulfills the user's request to differentiate the provided expression with respect to `x`. The result (`4*x`) was derived directly from the response of the tool (`""4*x""`). No information was generated independently of the tool's response. Hence, Objective 3 is also a success.",,
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the expected API call is:  
`'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with '{ ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA"" }'`.

The model successfully invoked the tool `'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'` with arguments containing  
`{ ""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"" }`.  
The tool name matches the expected tool call, and all required arguments (`ticker`, `sdate`, and `edate`) were correctly supplied. This satisfies Objective 2, even though there was no actual response matching due to errors.  

For **Objective 3**, the model did not provide a final answer or actionable response to fulfill the user's requirement of obtaining Tesla's stock price data. Instead, the model asked for confirmation and then ""chose to give up and restart"" without completing the task. Therefore, the final answer did not meet the user's instruction, resulting in a failure for Objective 3.",,
