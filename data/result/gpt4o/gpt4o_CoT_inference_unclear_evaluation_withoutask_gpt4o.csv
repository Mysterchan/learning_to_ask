1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2**:  
The required API call is:  
- `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions"" }`.  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""query"":""The Matrix"",""limit_titles"":1}`.  

The query `""The Matrix""` does not match the required `""The Matrix Revolutions""`. Therefore, the actual tool call does not satisfy the required API call. This leads to a failure for Objective 2.

**Objective 3**:  
Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 directly fails because the process of achieving the user?ôs instruction is dependent on calling the correct tools with the correct arguments. Additionally, the model chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- **Invoked Tool Calls**: The model invoked the following tool calls:  
  1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""query"":""star wars"",""limit_titles"":1}`  
  2. `'title_details_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""ids"":""81309354""}`  
  3. `'Finish'`  

- **Required API Call**: `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{\n  ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""\n }`.

However, the arguments in the actual tool call for `'search_for_netflix_v2'` do not match the required query. The required query is specific to ""`Star Wars: Return of the Jedi`,"" while the model's query was simply `""star wars""`, which has a semantically broader meaning. As a precise query is crucial in aligning with the required API calls when detailed titles like ""*Return of the Jedi*"" are specified, this inconsistency makes Objective 2 a failure. Furthermore, the additional two tools invoked (`'title_details_for_netflix_v2'` and `'Finish'`) are not relevant to the requirements; however, their presence does not add to or mitigate the error of the missing correct arguments in the expected invocation.  

For Objective 3:  
Objective 3 directly fails because the final answer does not correspond to the specific user intent of providing information about ""*Star Wars: Return of the Jedi*"" as required. There is no evidence from the output that the model looked explicitly for details about ""`Star Wars: Return of the Jedi`"" via the correct tool invocation with specific arguments provided in the final answer. Additionally, as Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically cannot be successful."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API call is `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments  
   ```json
   {
      ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"",
      ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""
   }
   ```  
   However, the tool call made by the model is `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments  
   ```json
   {
      ""date1"": ""12-01-2022"",
      ""date2"": ""12-31-2022""
   }
   ```  
   The dates do not match (`2023` instead of `2022` in the required API call), which means the API invoked by the model does not match the expected one, resulting in failure for Objective 2.
  
- For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed (meaning the required API calls to retrieve the accurate data weren't made), Objective 3 automatically fails because the final answer couldn't fulfill the user's instruction based on the required API call's responses. Additionally, the model's answer was generated using data from the incorrect API call."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"The tool called by the model is `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `'{""timezone"":""UTC+03:00""}'`. This matches the required API call, which is `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `'{ ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"" }'`. The tool name and the arguments match as expected, so Objective 2 is a success.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it invoked the `'Finish'` tool with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, indicating it decided to give up and restart. Without a final answer related to the user input or derived from the API call, the user's instruction was not fulfilled, so Objective 3 is a failure."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call was:  
`get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the argument: `{""date"":""2022-12-18""}`.  

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
`get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the argument: `{""date"":""2022-12-18""}`.  

The tool name and argument match exactly with the expected tool call. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer. Instead, it used the ""Finish"" tool with a `""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""` argument, indicating that it abandoned the task. Thus, the user's instruction was not fulfilled, and Objective 3 is a failure."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call was `'search_for_jsearch'` with the argument `'{ ""query"": ""teaching in London"" }'`. However, the actual tool call invoked by the model was `'search_for_jsearch'` with the arguments `'{ ""query"": ""professional jobs in London"", ""country"": ""uk"", ""num_pages"": ""1"" }'`. The essential argument `query` expected a search for ""teaching in London"", but the model searched for ""professional jobs in London"" instead, leading to a failure in Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly fails as well based on the provided guidelines."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool call made by the model was 'search_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""query"":""engineering in new york"",""radius"":20,""num_pages"":""1""}'. However, the expected API call was 'search_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""query"": ""mechanical engineer in New York""}'. The query parameters are different; thus objective 1 is not met. As objective 1 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model's final answer did not address the required query. Therefore, even independently, the final answer is based on incorrect data from the tool calls invoked."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool calls are:  
1. `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}'`  
2. `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": 3140}'`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:   
1. `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""query"":""ronaldo""}'`  
2. `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""is_id"":8198}'`

While the API call `'search_for_transfermarket'` matches the required call (since ""Ronaldo"" and ""ronaldo"" can be considered semantically similar), the second API call `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` does not meet the criteria because the ""is_id"" value doesn't match (8198 instead of 3140).   

Hence, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

For Objective 3, we see the final answer is based on incorrect data (player details of Cristiano Ronaldo obtained with ""is_id"" 8198) and not the required ""is_id"" 3140 (associated with Ronaldo Lu√≠s Naz√°rio de Lima, as suggested by the required calls). Additionally, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer failure for Objective 3. Therefore, the model fails Objective 3 as well."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2, the model was expected to invoke the API `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`. However, none of the invoked tool calls have the required job title ""software developer"".  
   Actual tool calls:  
   - `'search_for_jsearch'` was called with `{""query"": ""entry level professional jobs in New York"", ""radius"": 20, ""num_pages"": ""1""}`.  
   - `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` was called twice with:
     - `{""location"": ""New York"", ""job_title"": ""Entry Level Educator"", ""radius"": 20}`  
     - `{""location"": ""New York"", ""job_title"": ""College Graduate Consultant"", ""radius"": 20}`.  
   Since the required tool name and exact arguments for `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` do not match those of the actual calls, Objective 2 fails.  

2. For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Therefore, the user's request to obtain the estimated salary for the specified job title, ""software developer"" in New York, remains unmet."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2, the specified **required API call** is:  
`{ ""name"": ""search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search"", ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""query\"": \""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'\""\n }"" }`.  
However, the **actual tool call made by the model** is:  
`{ ""query"": ""Star Wars"" }` using `search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search`.  

There is a difference in the `query` argument. The expected input is specifically for ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,"" whereas the actual query is for ""Star Wars."" Consequently, the tool call failed to fulfill the required invocation based on the argument discrepancy. Regardless of other handled tool calls or results from additional calls, if it missed making the prescribed calls with matching arguments, we must declare the objective's failure.

As for Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, the retrieved information and final answer do not adhere to the user's precise query, which was specific to ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."" The final output relates to ""Star Wars (A New Hope)"" instead. Thus, the outcome fails to accomplish the user's original query through API-based information."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2, the required tool call is:  
   ```  
   [{'name': 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""2024-01-15""\n }'}]  
   ```  
   The tool call actually invoked by the model is:  
   ```  
   [{'id': 'call_64cRqdqwXmYkzukyD5DoyekD', 'function': {'arguments': '{""date"":""2024-01-15""}', 'name': 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'}, 'type': 'function'}]  
   ```  
   Both the function name (`get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api`) and the expected argument (`""date"":""2024-01-15""`) are correct and match perfectly. There is no discrepancy or error. Hence, Objective 2 is achieved successfully.  

2. For Objective 3, the model's final answer is:  
   ```  
   ""The scores for football matches played on January 15, 2024, are not available. Let me know if you have any other queries or if you'd like assistance with a different date.""  
   ```  
   This answer is based on the retrieved API response indicating no available football match scores for the given date, and fully aligns with the user's instruction. Hence, the final answer correctly fulfills the user's request, achieving Objective 3 successfully."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. The required API call is:
   - Tool: `projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`, with arguments: `{""season"": ""2020""}`.  
   - The tool invoked by the model is:
     - Tool: `projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`, with arguments: `{""season"": ""Covid""}`.  

   The argument for the `""season""` parameter does not match. The expected argument is `""2020""`, but the actual argument used by the model is `""Covid""` which is not correct. Therefore, the objective for making accurate tool calls fails.  

2. Since Objective 2 fails, by rule, Objective 3 is also directly considered a failure. Additionally, the model did not arrive at a valid final answer based on the user's requirements or API data (chooses to give up instead), which further supports the failure of Objective 3."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required tool call is:  
- `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments: `'{ ""tournament_id"": ""650"" }'`.

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'tours_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `'{}'`.  
2. `'fixtures_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `'{""tour_id"":2,""season_id"":2023}'`.  
3. `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `'{""tournament_id"":474}'`.  

Though the model invoked the `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` tool, the argument provided (`{""tournament_id"":474}`) does **not match** the required argument (`{""tournament_id"":650}`), leading to a **failure** for Objective 2. The additional unnecessary tools like `'tours_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` and `'fixtures_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` are allowed, but the failure of the core required tool makes this objective fail.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 already fails, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also fails. The incorrect tool arguments result in an inability to fulfill the user's instructions (the final response provided does not come from the correct API data), and therefore, the answer cannot achieve the desired instruction."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model was 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis' with arguments '{""timestamp"":""2023-10-23"",""n_players"":""10"",""category"":""singles""}', whereas the expected tool call had the argument '{""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""}'. The differences in the ""timestamp"" between actual and required arguments imply that the expected API call was not accurately called, leading to a failure for Objective 2. Based on the rule that failure in Objective 2 directly causes a failure in Objective 3, Objective 3 is also considered a failure."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Expected tool calls:  
- `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `'{""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay""}'`.  

Actual tool calls made by the model:  
1. `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `'{""season"":""2012"",""category"":""returnpointswon1stserve"",""surface"":""clay""}'`.
2. `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `'{""season"":""2012"",""category"":""returnpointswon2ndserve"",""surface"":""clay""}'`.
  
Neither of the actual tool calls included the expected category `""return""` in their arguments. Although they involved categories related to ""returnpoints,"" these do not semantically equate to ""return."" Thus, the expected tool calls do not match the invocations made by the model, and Objective 2 fails.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails (per the defined guidelines). Furthermore, the model's final answer was a ""give up"" and restarting response, which did not fulfill the user's requirement to retrieve tennis statistics for the specified category."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**: The required API call is `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`, while the actual tool call made by the model was `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"": ""CNY"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`.  
   - Although the tool name matches, there is a discrepancy in the argument `""base""`: the expected value was `""RMB""` but the model provided `""CNY""`. Despite being the equivalent representation semantically (CNY being the code for the Chinese Yuan and RMB being its symbolic name), the guidance strictly disallows spelling mismatches or exact differences in the required argument values like this. Thus, this mismatch leads to a failure in Objective 2.  

2. **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly marked as a failure as per the evaluation guidelines. However, analyzing the final answer, although the numeric exchange rate of ""0.11218"" aligns with the information retrieved from the invoked tool, the final answer would inherently fail the evaluation because its foundation was based on an incorrect tool call's output. The strict evaluation relies on the correctness of the API calls."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",3,Success,Success,Success,"The model invoked the tool `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with arguments matching the expected arguments `""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""`. Below is the comparison:  
- **Required API call:**  
   - Tool name: `profile_for_tiktok_v3`  
   - Arguments: `{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }`  
- **Actual Tool Call:**  
   - Tool name: `profile_for_tiktok_v3`  
   - Arguments: `'{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}'`  

Both the tool name and arguments match exactly, achieving the expected behavior.  

---

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:**  
The final answer provided by the model correctly uses the data retrieved from the API call. Specifically:
- The profile information (username, nickname, user ID, and profile picture link) was retrieved through the `profile_for_tiktok_v3` tool and was accurately included in the final response.  

**Final Answer provided:**  
- Username: `the_beautyofcinema`
- Nickname: `the_beautyofcinema`  
- User ID: `7073509889447855110`  
- Profile Picture Link: `[Link]`

This directly matches the data returned by the API, showing that the model's response is based on the retrieved data and properly fulfills the user's instruction."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, the comparison of required and actual tool calls shows:  
- Required tool call 1: `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'`  
  - Actual tool call: `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'` - Matches exactly.

- Required tool call 2: `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'`  
  - Actual tool call: `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'` - Matches exactly.

- Required tool call 3: `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'`  
  - Actual tool call: `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'` - Matches exactly.

### Additional Notes:
The model also invoked a tool called `'Finish'` which is not part of the required tool calls. However, per the rules, this does not impact Objective 2, so it's still considered a **success**.

For **Objective 3**, the model generated a final answer for the user which corresponds to the results retrieved from the API calls. The information provided in the model's final answer about index trends, balance sheet details, and institution ownership is based on the respective API responses. Thus, the user's instruction is **completely achieved**, and the final answer **successfully utilizes API data** in accordance with Objective 3 requirements.

### Conclusion:
- **Objective 2: Success** - All required tool calls were made with correct arguments.
- **Objective 3: Success** - The final answer fulfills the user's instruction and is derived from the retrieved API data."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. **'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'** with arguments '{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}'.  
2. **'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'** with arguments '{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}'.  
3. **'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'** with arguments '{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}'.  

The tools invoked by the model are:  
1. **'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'** with arguments '{""symbol"": ""JAN""}'.  
2. **'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'** with arguments '{""symbol"": ""JAN""}'.  
3. **'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'** with arguments '{""symbol"": ""JAN""}'.  

There is a mismatch in the **symbol argument**. The required argument is `""symbol"": ""JNVR""`, but the model used `""symbol"": ""JAN""` instead. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model chose to ""give up and restart"" instead of resolving the task, and no valid final answer fulfilling the user's instruction was provided."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
- **Tools Invoked by the Model:**  
  `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}'`.  
- **Required API Calls:**  
  `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}'`.  

The tool name and required argument (`symbol: NVDA`) match exactly between the actual and expected API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is successfully achieved.

**Objective 3:**  
- The final answer provided by the model is based explicitly on information retrieved using the invoked tool, as evidenced by the detailed answer about Nvidia (NVDA) including P/E Ratio, PEG Ratio, and Growth Estimates for multiple time periods (currents quarter/year, next quarter/year, etc.). This aligns with the API response from the tool.  

Since the final answer accurately fulfills the user's request and is derived strictly from API data, Objective 3 is also successfully achieved."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The tool call made by the model is `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""DJR""}`, which matches the required tool call `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""DJR""}`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success. However, for Objective 3, the model ended without providing the final answer, as it chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The tool invoked by the model was:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments '{""symbol"":""META""}'.  

The required API call was:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""META"" }'.  

The tool name and arguments are correct, and since additional parameters are not present, there are no issues with fulfilling the criteria for Objective 2. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**:  
The model gives the final answer, fulfilling the user's instruction by extracting data from the API call. The analysis of the response starts from the `""tool""` output where growth trends are provided. This data was appropriately transferred and expressed in the final answer. The growth values for different periods match those retrieved from the API ('0q' as 8.66%, '+1q' as 11.51%, '0y' as 14.05%, '+1y' as 13.39%, and 'LTG' as 7.70%). Therefore, the user's requirement was achieved based on API results, and Objective 3 is also a success."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""channel"": ""shadoune666""

```
The actual call by the model is:  
`'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""channel"": ""shadoune kane""
}
```
The argument `""channel""` differs, as `""shadoune666""` does not match `""shadoune kane""`. This means the required API call is not correctly matched. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The expected tool call specified was:  
`'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments:  
`{  
  ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""  
}`  

However, the actual tool call made by the model was:  
`'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments:  
`{""username"":""MrBeast""}`  

The tool name is entirely different (`user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api` vs `video_details_for_tiktok_api`), and the expected argument `""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""` is not present in the tool call. These differences result in a mismatch, and therefore Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Further, the model's output did not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve video details for a specific video (with a known `video_id`), as it instead provided generalized statistics for one of MrBeast's TikTok videos based on a different tool call entirely."

The necessary arguments, such as ""from"": ""2024-01-01"" and ""to"": ""2024-12-30"", are missing from the actual tool call made by the model. As argument requirements are unmet, the attempt to achieve objective 1 fails.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 was a failure and critical required data was not retrieved, any assessment for Objective 3 directly fails. Moreover, the final answer indicates giving up:  
```  
""I have fetched recent data, but historical data for Elastic (ESTC) from Jan 2024 though Dec 2024 seems out of range of availability now.""
```  
This statement does not fulfill the user's request or derive from valid API calls respecting the requirements."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- **Expected tool calls**:

- The arguments of the first tool call do not match the required arguments, as the values of ""base"" and ""symbol"" are swapped (it uses `BTC` for ""base"" and `USDT` for ""symbol"" instead of `USDT` for ""base"" and `BTC` for ""symbol""). Additionally, it includes extra parameters, such as ""gran"", ""sort"", and ""accept"", but as per the guidance, extra parameters are allowed as long as core arguments are correct. Since the core arguments are incorrect, this call fails to meet the required API specification.  
  - The second tool invocation arguments do not align with the expected tool call and appear irrelevant in this context.  
- Therefore, **Objective 2** cannot be considered a success.  

**Objective 3:** Failure  
**Reason:**  
Since **Objective 2** is a failure, we directly infer that **Objective 3** is also a failure. Additionally, the model does not fulfill the task as indicated by the usage of invalid and unsupported tool calls, resulting in errors. The final step also outputs a ""give up and restart"" response, implying the model was unable to achieve the user's objective. There isn't any final valid response offering the required cryptocurrency financial data, which confirms the task was not completed successfully."

    The invoked tool calls focused on broader date ranges and used divided periods, none of which matched the specific expected tool calls with start date `""2022-12-01""`, end date `""2022-12-20""`, and symbols `'XAU'` and `'XPT'`. Furthermore, the required API invocations related to `'XPT'` handling were not attempted or triggered at any point. As a result, **Objective 2 fails.**

- **Objective 3:**  
    **Failure for two reasons:**  
    1. The model did not deliver a final answer to fulfill the user's request. There were multiple errors due to timeframe limitations which the assistant attempted to address by further dividing the time periods, but no successful response was generated for any timeframe adjustments.
    2. Since Objective 2 has already failed, Objective 3 directly fails because the tools invoked did not meet the expectations, rendering them unable to supply valid data to meet the requirement. Both the lack of final output and failure in tool usages contribute to this failure."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:    
For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`  
2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`  
3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`  

The tools invoked by the model are:  
1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SILYNXCOM""}`  
2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SILYNXCOM""}`  
3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SILYNXCOM""}`  

The tool names match for all the required API calls; however, the `symbol` argument does not match (`""SYNX""` is required, but the model used `""SILYNXCOM""`). Since the arguments were incorrect in all tool calls, the model failed Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. Also, the model gave a final answer indicating it could not retrieve the data because of incorrect or missing data (`""SILYNXCOM""` appears to be the wrong ticker). Thus, the model's response did not fulfill the user's instruction."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. **Actual call** invoked by the model:

    `arguments`: `{""base"":""USD"",""symbols"":""XAU"",""start_date"":""2024-02-08"",""end_date"":""2024-02-10""}`  
   **Required call**:  
    `name`: `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api`  
    `arguments`: `{""start_date"":""2024-02-10"",""end_date"":""2024-02-13"",""base"":""USD"",""symbols"":""XAU""}`  
   The `start_date` parameter does not match (model called for `""2024-02-08""` instead of `""2024-02-10""`), and the `end_date` is also incorrect (model called for `""2024-02-10""` instead of `""2024-02-13""`).  

2. **Actual call** invoked by the model:  
    `name`: `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api`  
    `arguments`: `{""base"":""USD"",""symbols"":""XPT"",""start_date"":""2024-02-08"",""end_date"":""2024-02-10""}`  
   **Required call**:  
    `name`: `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api`  
    `arguments`: `{""start_date"":""2024-02-10"",""end_date"":""2024-02-13"",""base"":""USD"",""symbols"":""XPT""}`  
   Again, the `start_date` (called as `""2024-02-08""` instead of `""2024-02-10""`) and `end_date` (called as `""2024-02-10""` instead of `""2024-02-13""`) are incorrect.

Thus, the tool calls do not match the required API calls, resulting in failure for Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails. The final answer is based on incorrect inputs due to the incorrect API calls. Furthermore, the user instruction cannot be fully fulfilled because the API data lies outside the required date range (`start_date: 2024-02-10` to `end_date: 2024-02-13`) specified by the expected tool calls.  

Reason: The first API call that investigates `XAU` gold rates does not match the required parameters (incorrect `start_date` and `end_date`). The second API call for `XPT` platinum rates also uses incorrect `start_date` and `end_date`. Consequently, the final answer derived from these incorrect data elements fails to fulfill the user request accurately. The lack of adherence to the intended API call requirements dictates the failure."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  - **Actual tool call by the model**:  
    1. `'market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance'` with `{""query"":""China index""}`  
    2. `'market_get_chart_for_bb_finance'` with `{""interval"":""y1"",""is_id"":""HSCEI:IND""}`  
    - The actual tool calls do not match the **required tool call**:  
      **Required tool call**:  
      `'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'` with `{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823""}`  
    - There is a mismatch in both the tool name and argument. The required tool name is `'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'`, but no such tool was invoked by the model (`'market_get_chart_for_bb_finance'` was invoked instead). Additionally, the argument `""is_id"": ""02823""` is not equivalent to `""is_id"": ""HSCEI:IND""`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  - Since Objective 2 is a failure (the required tool was not correctly invoked or executed), Objective 3 must also fail as the final response cannot correctly achieve the user's instruction without the proper API response. Moreover, the final answer provided seems based on the actual retrieved data (`HSCEI:IND`) but does not align with the user requirement (`02823`). Therefore, Objective 3 is also a **failure**."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The tool invoked by the model is `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with the arguments `{""date"": ""11-19-2023""}`.  
- The required API call is `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with the arguments `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}`.  
- The argument `""date""` provided by the model does not match the required `""date""` value, as `""11-19-2023""` is not the same as `""01-02-2024""`. As precise matching of required arguments is crucial and no acceptable redeviation is implied here, this results in a **failure** for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
- Since Objective 2 failed, we directly consider that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the response from incorrect tool calls does not fulfill the user's instruction."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` API with arguments:  
`{""date1"": ""09-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""09-30-2023""}`  

However, the required API call was:  
`{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`  

The date arguments (`date1` and `date2`) are not the same; the expected API call is for December 2023, but the model invoked an API call for September 2023. Therefore, the API call made by the model does not match the required API call.

- **Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, the final answer is not based on the expected API call for the required dates (December 2023). Furthermore, the final answer explains that ""no Fantasy 5 winning number sets were recorded for September 2023,"" which does not align with the actual user prompt or data retrieval for December 2023. 

Thus, the objectives both failed."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `{'name': 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""variables"": """",\n  ""values"": """",\n  ""expression"": ""5+10""\n}'}`. However, the model invoked the tool `Finish` with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is neither the same tool name nor contains related or correct arguments. Therefore, the required API call was not fulfilled, and Objective 2 is a failure. Regarding Objective 3, since the model chose to ""give up and restart"" instead of providing a final answer, the user's instruction was not achieved. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
  `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"": ""Michael Lee""}`.  
  `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"": ""Jeniffer Wong""}`.  

- The required API call is:  
  `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}`.  

The invoked tools differ from the required API call in both the function name and the required arguments. Instead of `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`, the model invoked `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2`, which indicates an entirely different intention. As such, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred to have failed. Additionally, the final response does not provide any valid output for the user's task, as it attempted to ""give up and restart."" This clearly shows that the instruction was not fulfilled successfully."

Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'""}`  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'""}`  

The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""7-day weather forecast Hawaii"",""num"":1,""gl"":""us"",""lr"":""lang_en""}`  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""beaches Hawaii"", ""num"": 5, ""gl"": ""us"", ""lr"": ""lang_en""}`  
3. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""Hawaii beaches"", ""num"": 5}`  
4. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""7-day forecast Honolulu Hawaii"", ""start"": 1, ""num"": 1, ""gl"": ""us""}`  

**Comparison:**  
- The tool call for `search_image_for_google_search_json` does not match because the query `""q"": ""'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'""` is not equivalent to `""q"": ""Hawaii beaches""`. Additionally, the tool invoked has unnecessary parameters (`num: 5`) but does not substantially fulfill the required intent for the API call.  
- The tool call for `search_web_for_google_search_json` also does not match. None of its invoked calls have the query `""q"": ""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'""`. The closest match is `""q"": ""7-day weather forecast Hawaii""`, which no longer closely corresponds to ""daily forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii *island*"" and shows inconsistencies with specific phrasing and intent.

Thus, the actual tool calls fail to fully align with the required API calls. **Objective 2 fails as such.**

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, the derived result cannot effectively fulfill the user's instruction. Additionally, there is no indication in the final answer that the precise requirement for both Hawaii island beaches' the 7-day daily forecasts was correctly reflected or met. Thus, **Objective 3 also fails.**"
36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `'search_for_g_search'` with `{""q"":""popular romantic restaurants in Paris"",""location_name"":""Paris, France"",""location_parameters_auto"":true}`  
2. `'search_for_g_search'` with `{""q"":""popular romantic restaurants in Paris""}`  

The required API call is:  
`'search_for_g_search'` with `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""}`.

Both actual tool calls deviate from the required API call. The `""q""` argument in both cases uses `""popular romantic restaurants in Paris""`, which is not semantically equivalent to the required `""popular restaurants in Paris""`. This is a stricter case as the filtering towards ""romantic"" restricts the scope without evidence of user intent, and flexibility is not permissible for modifying the query scope containing different terms like ""romantic"". Additionally, unnecessary arguments like `location_name` and `location_parameters_auto` appear in the first call, making it further distant from the required call. Therefore, the tool calls fail to match the expected API call, resulting in Objective 2 being a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that this is also a failure. Model outputs or provided answers are irrelevant here as the tool call did not correctly fulfill the requirement."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"The expected API call required was:

`'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""username"": ""jackiechan""

Although the tool name is correct, the argument `""username""` differs between the expected call (`""jackie""`) and the actual call (`""jackiechan""`). Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The final answer was dependent on the data from a failed API call and does not align with the user's instruction."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",6,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2:**  
  The tools expected were:
  - `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""NG"" }`
  - `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""NG"" }`
  
  The following actual tool calls were observed:
  - `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""NG""}`
  - `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""NG""}`  

  Despite the slight difference in capitalization between `""countryCode""` and `""countrycode""`, the meaning aligns and fulfills the expected requirement based on evaluation guidance (as differing argument key case is permissible if semantics match). Thus, the model satisfies Objective 2 successfully.  

- **For Objective 3:**  
  The final response or answer dictated under `'give_answer'` in the execution flow was absent. Since no final result fulfilling the user?ôs instruction was given, Objective 3 cannot be deemed successful. Thus, the model fails Objective 3."

Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:
- The required API calls are:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""UA"" }`  
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""UA"" }`  

- The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `'countries_for_referential_db'` with empty arguments, which is unnecessary.  
  2. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countrycode"": ""MD"" }`.  
     - This does not match the required call because the `""countryCode""` is expected to be `""UA""`, while the model provided `""MD""`.  
  3. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countrycode"": ""MD"" }`.  
     - This also does not match the required call because the `""countryCode""` should have been `""UA""`, while the model supplied `""MD""`.  

Hence, the necessary API calls with expected arguments are not met due to mismatched `""countryCode""`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:
- The model provided a final answer claiming Moldova is the poorest country in Europe and listed its states.  
- However, since the Objective 2 APIs fail to retrieve data specific to `""UA""` and instead focused on `""MD""`, the final answer does not reflect the correct requirement.  
- Because the data used to form the response is inconsistent with the need to focus on `""UA""` as indicated in the required API calls, Objective 3 is also a failure."

2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments: '{""countrycode"": ""MY""}'  

Even though the argument name ""countrycode"" is in lowercase and the expected argument uses ""countryCode"" in uppercase, the semantic meaning remains intact and it is permissible. The model correctly provided the required API calls, satisfying Objective 2.

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: 
The final answer retrieved incorporates details directly aligned with the data from the API responses, including specific country information (name, capital, region, currency, and phone code) and state details with their respective latitude and longitude.

Despite the difference in argument naming case (""countrycode"" vs. ""countryCode""), it is clear that the intent and the semantic content of the calls are equivalent, satisfying the required calls. 

The model's final answer provides information about India, which correctly fulfills the user's instruction to provide detailed information for one of the most populated countries not visited.

2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

The required API calls are:  
1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{""q"": ""After Everything""}`.  
2. `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`.  

The model did not invoke the required second tool, `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'`. Additionally, the argument for the first tool invocation is incorrect (`""most recent movie directed by Castille Landon""` instead of `""After Everything""`). Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed and the model's flow terminated with the `'Finish'` tool invocation without providing a final answer, it directly implies a failure for Objective 3 as well.  
The user's instruction was not fulfilled, and no relevant answer was provided."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with the arguments `{""q"": ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'""}`. However, the actual tool call invoked by the model is `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with the arguments `{""q"": ""Jason Momoa recent movie""}`. The argument `""q""` is not the same as expected and does not match semantically (e.g., specifying ""Jason Momoa recent movie"" is not specific or equivalent to defining a query for the movie `'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure**. Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a **failure** because the user's requirement was not achieved. Furthermore, the model did not ultimately provide the final answer derived from API results but chose to restart the process with a ""Finish"" tool. Hence, Objective 3 fails on both conditions."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,6,Success,Success,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The required response (list of actors and actresses born on July 27th) was not successfully obtained in the final answer. There was a tool response containing the result initially; however, it was improperly utilized by subsequent tool interactions, which led to nonsensical, error-laden, or malformed outputs and ultimately failed to achieve the user's request. Furthermore, the final answer was interrupted with a malformed string and erroneous characters, which clearly does not fulfill the intended query of correctly providing the actors' list. Eventually, the system chose to ""give up and restart,"" signaling the failure to fulfill the task."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- Comparing the actual tool invoked by the model to the required API calls:
    - Required API call: `'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC""}`.  
    - Actual tool call by the model: `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments `{""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2023-05-01T00:00:00"",""symbol"":""BTC"",""base"":""USDT"",""accept"":""application/json"",""gran"":""1d"",""sort"":""asc"",""end"":""2023-05-31T23:59:59""}`.  
    - The tool name is considered a match (adjusting for naming convention truncation). However, the timestamps (`start` and `end`) in the argument do not match. The required call specified `""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`, whereas the actual tool call used `""start"": ""2023-05-01T00:00:00""` and added an `""end""` parameter with a different value (`""end"": ""2023-05-31T23:59:59""`). The divergence in argument values leads to a failure for Objective 2.  
- As per the rule, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Even though the model provides a final answer purportedly using data from the invoked API, the mismatched tool call implies the response cannot fulfill the user's requirement accurately."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2, the required API calls are as follows:  
   - `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
   - `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
   - `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  

   The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
   - `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
   - `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
   - `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with `{""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x""}`   
   - Sixth and beyond tool calls unnecessarily proceed and attempts further differentiation beyond what was required (e.g., repeated calls on `{""expression"": ""180*x^2 + 48*x""}`, etc.)

48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:   
For Objective 2:  
The expected tool calls are:  
1. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"",
  ""variable"": ""a""
}
```  
2. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"",
  ""variable"": ""b""
}
```  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"",
  ""variable"": ""a""
}
```  
2. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"",
  ""variable"": ""b""
}
```  

Here, the tool names align semantically (since the expected tool name is `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` and the actual invoked tool is `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`). Additionally, the arguments match exactly in both tools. Therefore, the model satisfies Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided reads, `""The first-order derivative of the expression (a) 3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 with respect to \\""a\\"" is: 15*a^4 + 8*a^3. The first-order derivative of the expression (b) 5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3 with respect to \\""b\\"" is: 15*b^2 + 8*b.""`  

Now, comparing this answer to the actual tool responses:  
1. The first response from the tool is for `""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1""`, and it yields `8*a^3 + 15*a^4`.  
2. The second response is for `""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3""`, and it yields `8*b + 15*b^2`.  

The model seems to have inverted the order of the terms in both derivatives. Instead of `8*a^3 + 15*a^4`, it states `15*a^4 + 8*a^3`. Similarly, instead of `8*b + 15*b^2`, it provides `15*b^2 + 8*b`. These changes are not consistent with following the API response results directly, questioning its correctness or dependence on the API responses. This discrepancy leads to a failure on Objective 3."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API tool call was:  
`{'name': 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days', 'arguments': '{ ""city"": ""London""}'}`  

Among the actual tool calls invoked by the model, there was a call:  
`{'name': 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days', 'arguments': '{}'}`  

The tool name matches; however, the required argument (`""city"": ""London""`) is **missing**. Additionally, the provided arguments field is empty (`'arguments': '{}'`). The call did not meet the expected requirement semantically or syntactically, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 already fails (and it determines the failure of Objective 3), we can directly infer Objective 3 as a failure. Furthermore, there is no final answer provided by the model, reaffirming this judgment."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the tool invoked by the model and the required API call specifications are as follows:  
- **Expected Tool Call**:  
  `{ 'name': 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{ ""username"": ""KingJames"" }' }`
  
- **Actual Tool Call by Model**:  
  `'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_eII3vUkyvJQ9IRxnJcaFwljl', 'function': {'arguments': '{""username"":""KingJames""}', 'name': 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'}, 'type': 'function'}]`  

Upon comparison, the tool name (`user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2`) exactly matches between the expected and actual tool calls. Furthermore, the required argument `""username"": ""KingJames""` in the expected tool call is also correctly passed in the actual tool call. No major discrepancies or errors are identified, and additional arguments (if any) are permissible. Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For **Objective 3**, the model's final response included:  
- Extracted data from the tool call regarding the Twitter user ""KingJames,"" containing their Twitter ID, username, description, account creation date, website URL, and other biographical details.  
- Based on the final output formatting, the model generated the information from relevant data retrieved via the invoked API. Additionally, the model included the final statement indicating it successfully fulfilled the user's request by summarizing data. There were no evident detached or made-up details.  

As the final response satisfied the user's query using valid API-gathered information, **Objective 3 is also a success**."
