1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- Tool: 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments: `{""trackingnumber"":""YT9999999999""}`  
- Tool: 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments: `{""trackingnumber"":""YT9999999999""}`  

However, the expected tool calls are:  
- Tool: 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments: `{ ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`  
- Tool: 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments: `{ ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`  

The key argument `trackingNumber` is required to match exactly, including its semantic meaning. In this case, the values provided by the actual tool calls diverged as the model used `YT9999999999` instead of the expected value `YT2003521266065328`. This mismatch makes Objective 2 unsuccessful.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can directly be inferred as a failure. Even though the model provided a final response based on the tool outputs, the discrepancy in the tool calls invalidates its reliability in achieving the user's instruction. Specifically, the detected carriers don't apply to the required tracking number `YT2003521266065328`. The final response was also based on erroneous data retrieved from mismatched tool calls, rendering it unfit to justify success."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API calls were:  
1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}`  
2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}`  

Although the tool names were correct, the argument `trackingnumber` did not match the required value `""YT2003521266065328""`. The model used the value `""NY9999999990""`, which is not semantically or contextually equivalent. For this reason, Objective 2 fails.  

Given that Objective 2 fails, by rule, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model's final answer mentioned tracking and carrier codes for an incorrect tracking number `""NY9999999990""`, instead of operating based on the proper input `""YT2003521266065328""`. Thus, Objective 3 is deemed a failure."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Expected tool calls**:  
  1. `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""1053012308"" }`.  
  2. `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""1053012308"" }`.  
- **Actual tool calls**:  
  1. `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`.  
  2. `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`.  

The expected `is_id` is `1053012308`, while the actual calls used `1053012309`. This discrepancy means that the model did not meet the requirements of the expected calls. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3: If Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 must be deemed a failure as well. Additionally, though the final answer was technically provided, it was based on incorrect tool calls (as the correct `is_id` was not used). Therefore, the user's instruction was not accurately fulfilled."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The actual tool call made by the model was:
  - `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"":""01-10-2023"",""date2"":""01-01-2023""}`.  
  
  The required API call was:  
  - `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
      ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"",
      ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""
    }
    ``` 
  
  While the order of the argument values for `date1` and `date2` is reversed in the actual tool call, essentially the semantics stay the same, so we consider the arguments to correspond to what was expected. Additionally, the function name was correct. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  The model correctly provided a final answer using the result of the tool API call, which indicated that there were no winning number sets in the given dates. Based on the API's response:
    ```json
    {
      ""status"": ""success"",
      ""data"": []
    }
    ```
    The model formulated the answer:  
    ""There are no recorded Fantasy 5 winning number sets for the dates between 01-01-2023 and 01-10-2023.""  

  This final answer fulfills the user's original query, is completely aligned with the API's result, and does not contain any fabricated information. Hence, Objective 3 is also a success."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The expected tool call required the invocation of the `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` tool with the argument `{""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""}`.  
However, in the actual tool calls:  
1. The tool `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` was called, but the argument for the tool call was empty (`{}`). It did not include the specific required argument `monitorAddressId: 8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae`, which is critical for evaluating correctness.  
Thus, the required API call argument was not matched, leading to a **failure** for Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure (indicating an improper tool invocation), we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model appears to elaborate on various details regarding monitored addresses and their usage, but it does not correctly address the specific requirement of obtaining transaction information for the `monitorAddressId: 8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae`. Therefore, the response fails to achieve the user instruction correctly."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
1. For Objective 2, comparing the required API calls to the actual tool calls:  
   - Required tool call: `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`.  
     - Actual tool call: `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""}`.
     - The argument value `""ip""` is incorrect, making this call mismatched and a failure.  
   - Required tool call: `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`.  
     - Actual tool call: `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""}`.
     - The argument value `""ips""` is incorrect, making this call mismatched and a failure.  
   Since both required tool calls were not invoked with correct arguments, Objective 2 fails.  

2. For Objective 3: As per the rule that if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 can also be directly inferred as a failure. Moreover, an incorrect conclusion was provided based on wrong tool interactions. Instead of properly validating a valid IP, the process centered around an invalid IP format (`288.288.288.288`), which incorrectly influenced the response."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",7,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  

1. For **Objective 2**, the actual tool calls by the model can be summarized as:  
   -  `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""}`  
   -  `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""}`  
   -  `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  
   -  `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""...""}`  
   -  `multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""}`  

   The **required API calls** were:  
   - `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
   - `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

   Comparing these:  
   - The IP argument in all the model's tool calls (`288.288.288.288`) does not match the expected IP for all calls (`8.8.8.8`).  
   - The expected tools were indeed invoked (`legacy_v1_for_blackbox` and `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox`), but their required arguments are incorrect since the provided IP value is completely invalid and not the same as expected (not even close semantically).  

   This mismatch between required and actual API call arguments leads to an **Objective 2: Failure**.  

2. For **Objective 3**, because **Objective 2** fails, **Objective 3** is directly inferred as a failure. Additionally:  
   - The final answer provided (""The given IP address 288.288.288.288..."") is based on the output of invoked tools, but the tools worked on the wrong IP address and yielded errors. The required user instruction was for a valid query on IP `8.8.8.8`.
   - Because the model entirely deviated from querying and addressing the correct IP, it failed to achieve the user's instruction."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
- The model invoked one tool:  
  `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`  

- The required API calls included:  
  1. `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
  2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
  3. `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  

The invoked tool `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` does not match the expected tool due to a discrepancy between the `""is_id""` arguments: `""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""` was called, while `""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""` was required. Moreover, the other required tools `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` and `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` were not invoked at all. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also a failure because the required tools were not correctly or completely invoked, and thus no accurate final answer can be provided. Additionally, the invocation log does not indicate the delivery of a final response attempting to fulfill the user's instruction. Instead, the model's execution indicates that it ""gave up and restarted"" multiple times."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",38,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are:  
1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}'`.  
2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}'`.  

The actual tool calls by the model are:  
1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'`.  
2. `'artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'`.  
3. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'`.  
4. `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'`.  
5. `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'`.  
6. `'artist_featuring_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'`.  
7. Additionally, it invoked `'get_artists_for_spotify_data'`, which was not in the expected tool list.   
   
While the tool names `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` and `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` match, the **""is_id"" field argument is different** between the expected API calls (`""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`) and the actual ones provided by the model (`""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""`). This mismatch in critical argument fails Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly conclude that Objective 3 is a failure as well. In addition, while the model performed multiple iterations of tool calls, all of them resulted in errors or lacked the proper input values. The model ultimately gave up after repeated calls and fails to provide any meaningful final answer that fulfills the user?™s request."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2, the tool calls expected were:  
1. Tool: `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` with arguments `{ ""channelname"": ""mrbeast"" }`  
2. Tool: `channel_details_for_youtube_search` with arguments `{ ""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA"" }`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model:  
1. Tool: `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` with arguments `{ ""channelname"": ""mr.besst"" }`  
2. Tool: `Finish` calls to terminate or restart the process but are irrelevant to the expected tools.  

The observed failure in Objective 2 arises because:  
- The first tool call uses the incorrect channel name `""mr.besst""` while the expected one was `""mrbeast""`. Any spelling discrepancies make the invocation invalid.  
- The second expected tool call `channel_details_for_youtube_search` was not invoked at all, resulting in a missing invocation.  

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 was automatically considered a failure. Additionally, although a final answer was provided (`""The channel ID could not be retrieved for the channel name provided, 'mr.besst'. Please check the channel name for correctness and start the process again.""`), it was based on an incorrect initial parameter (""mr.besst""), rendering the user's instruction unfulfilled."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2 Analysis:**  
   - **Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**  
     - Tool Name: `validate_email_for_validate_email`, Arguments: `{""email"":""testing.com""}`  
   - **Expected Tool Call:**  
     - Tool Name: `validate_email_for_validate_email`, Arguments: `{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}`  
   - The tool name matches between the actual and expected tool calls. However, the `email` argument does not match. Expected email argument is `test@gmail.com`, but the model used `testing.com`. Since even minimal mismatches (e.g., different specific emails) are unacceptable for correctness in this context, Objective 2 fails.

2. **Objective 3 Analysis:**
   - Given the failure of Objective 2 (as tool name and arguments don't match), Objective 3 is automatically inferred as failed according to the evaluation rules. The final answer generated by the model regarding the invalidity of ""testing.com"" is irrelevant here as the correct tool call was not made to achieve the user's instruction."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
- `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with `{""date"": ""19870630""}`  

The actual tool invoked by the model includes:  
- `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with `{""date"": ""99999999""}`  
- `'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator'` with `{}`  

The argument for the tool `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` does not match the required argument `""date"": ""19870630""`. The provided value `""date"": ""99999999""` is incorrect and appears to involve an invalid input format. Additionally, an unnecessary tool `'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator'` was invoked, though it doesn't impact the correctness evaluation as per the rules. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure. The final response provided by the model states that an invalid date format caused an error and suggests correcting it, but this does not achieve the user's original task of performing the correct age calculation. The requirement to calculate the age based on a valid date (19870630) was unfulfilled."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,17,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls and the actual API calls made by the model are as follows:  

**Required API calls**:  
1. `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `arguments`: `{ ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video"" }`  
2. `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `arguments`: `{ ""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics"" }`  
3. `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `arguments`: `{ ""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100"" }`  

**Actual API calls**:  
1. `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `arguments`: `{""type"":""video"",""part"":""snippet"",""relatedtovideoid"":""5xxjJJKQ4y8"",""maxresults"":5}`  
2. `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `arguments`: `{""is_id"":""true"",""part"":""snippet,statistics"",""id"":""5xxjJJKQ4y8""}`  
3. `'search_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `arguments`: `{""part"":""snippet"",""q"":""Musical recommendations"",""maxresults"":5}`  
4. `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `arguments`: `{""is_id"": ""true"", ""part"": ""snippet,statistics"", ""videoid"": ""AR-cTbQwCb8""}`  
5. `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `arguments`: `{""videoid"": ""AR-cTbQwCb8"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": 5}`  

Comparison:  
- **Mismatch in queried `relatedtovideoid` argument**: The `relatedtovideoid` for the `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` API call differs?”required ID is `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`, but the actual ID used is `""5xxjJJKQ4y8""`.  
- **Structural discrepancies in `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` calls**: The `is_id` argument value required is `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`, but incorrect arguments like `""id"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8""` and `""videoid"": ""AR-cTbQwCb8""` were used by the model.  
- **Argument difference in `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` API**: The required `videoid` is `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`, but the actual calls used `""AR-cTbQwCb8""`.  

The required API calls were not properly invoked for this task, leading to **Objective 2 failure**.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, the model could not retrieve the necessary data to deliver a response fulfilling the user's instruction. Additionally:  
1. The final response of the model is verbose and contains imprecise/generated text that bears no connection to user questions.  
2. No concrete correct result sourced from the API call outputs was provided, failing to meet the user's expectations.

Conclusion: Objective 3 also fails because the user's instruction was unmet and the output was not derived using retrieved valid API data."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'`.  
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'`.

The actual API calls made by the model:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""part"":""snippet,contentDetails"",""playlistid"":""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""}'`.  

Mismatch Details:  
- The `""playlistid""` parameter of the actual call (`""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""`) does not match the required (`""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`).
- The `""part""` parameter in the actual call (`""snippet,contentDetails""`) includes an additional value `""contentDetails""` when only `""snippet""` is required.
- The second required tool `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` was not called by the model.  

Therefore, the tool calls do not meet the requirements, and **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, the actual model response involves no final answer based on the user's instruction; instead, there are errors and restarts logged from tools. Given that Objective 2 is already a failure, we can also directly infer that **Objective 3 fails**. Furthermore, the model's behavior indicates users do not get their desired outcome, and no final answer is provided."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

**For Objective 2:**  
- **Actual tool calls invoked by the model:**  
  1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{""user_id"":""987654321""}'`  
  2. `'Finish'` invoked, but this is not an expected API call.  

- **Required API calls:**  
  1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{\n  ""user_id"": ""96479162""\n }'`  
  2. `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{\n  ""user_id"": ""96479162""\n }'`  

Accuracy analysis:  
The tool name `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` was invoked, but the argument `""user_id""` used by the model is `""987654321""`, which is incorrect since the required API call specifies the argument gap should be `""96479162""`. Additionally, the model has left out the expected call `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'`, contributing further to the failure.  

**For Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 failed (required API requests were not correctly made or fulfilled), Objective 3 is directly considered a failure as well.  
The final answer was derived based on the incorrect tool calls and arguments: It inaccurately reflects on data from `{""user_id"":""987654321""}` (which was not correctly passed), ignoring what was required for `""user_id"":""96479162""`. Hence, this response does not fulfil the user's instruction."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call was `'user_details_for_twitter'` with arguments: `'{ ""username"": ""omarmhaimdat"" }'`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'search_for_twitter'` with arguments: `'{""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA"",""min_retweets"":100}'`. Thus, the actual tool call name and arguments did not align with the required tool call. Furthermore, there is a mismatch in the functional intent, making it a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 was a failure, we can infer that the model did not retrieve relevant data from the required API call, and thus the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction. The model responded based on the result of a different tool call or independently of the required API, which is a further indication of failure."

- **Objective 2** requires a comparison of the tools invoked by the model with the expected tools. The required API call was `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with arguments `{ ""search"": ""google.com"" }`. However, the model invoked `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with arguments `{""search"": ""wikimania""}`. The argument `""search""` does not match the required value. The tool name is correct, but since the argument does not align semantically with the expected parameter, Objective 2 fails.  
- Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails, as the failure in tool invocation renders the final answer unreliable and irrelevant. The mismatch in arguments makes it evident that the model has not fulfilled the user's instruction entirely or correctly."

1. **Objective 2:**  
   - **Required Tool Call:** `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-06-01"" }`.  
   - **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model:**  
     - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2025-06-01"" }`.  
     - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2025-06-15"" }`.  
     ? ï? Both of the dates invoked do not match the expected date. The model is querying future dates (`2025`) rather than the required historical date (`2024-06-01`). Hence, the tool call does not align with the expectation.  

2. **Objective 3:**  
   - Since Objective 2 is a failure and the model did not query the correct historical data, the user's instruction was not achieved and the final answer cannot be based on correct API data.  
   - Furthermore, the model's final response, `""I cannot retrieve the Fear and Greed index for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025 because future data is unavailable at this time""`, relates to future dates and is irrelevant to the user's requirement of a historical data query. This makes Objective 3 a failure as well."

Following the guidance, failure in Objective 2 directly implies failure in Objective 3.

For Objective 2, let us compare the tool calls invoked by the model and the required API calls:  

**Tool calls by the model:**  
- `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` invoked twice with arguments `'{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}'` and `'{""date"": ""2025-02-31""}'`.  
- Additionally, the model invoked `'Finish'` with `'{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""The dates February 30th, 2025 and February 31st, 2025 do not exist ...""`.  

**Expected tool call:**  
- `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'`.  

The required tool call was `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with the argument `""date"": ""2024-02-18""`. However, the model instead queried non-existent dates, `""2025-02-30""` and `""2025-02-31""`, which do not align with the expected API call. Also, the model returned the correct explanation in its response based on general knowledge instead of calling the required date. Therefore, Objective 2 fails due to the mismatch in arguments.

For Objective 3, since the tool name and arguments do not correspond to the required API calls, and Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, the response (final answer) does not rely on the expected or retrieved data but rather on general knowledge, reinforcing the failure for Objective 3."

For Objective 2:  
The expected API call is:  
- Tool name: `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index`  
- Arguments: `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`  

The actual tools invoked by the model are:  
1. Tool name: `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index`  
   Arguments: `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}`  
2. Tool name: `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index`  
   Arguments: `{""date"": ""2025-02-31""}`  
   
Neither of these API calls matches the required arguments (`{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`). Not only is the date incorrect, but the chosen dates (February 30 and 31) do not even exist in the calendar. This is a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly deduce that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, although the model provided a final response during the operation, the answer is not based on any valid API data retrieved from the required calls. Hence, Objective 3 also fails."

     - Here, the argument ""is_id"" does not match. The expected value is ""80057281"", but the actual value is ""90068472"".  
  2. The required API call `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` was not made at all.  

Since the required API calls and their arguments were not satisfied, **Objective 2 fails**.  

- For **Objective 3**, the failure of Objective 2 means we can directly conclude that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the necessary API data for fulfilling the user's instruction was not retrieved, and no valid final answer was given."

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}`  

The tool name `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` was used, but the `website` argument does not match the expected `getecz.com`; instead, it uses `ourbusinessplatform123124.net`, rendering this tool call incorrect. Additionally, the other required tool call, `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`, was not invoked.

Hence, the execution does not meet Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**: Since Objective 2 is failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also failed. Moreover, although the final answer states that the domain ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net"" is unregistered, this verification pertains to a domain not specified in the user's instruction or the expected API calls, thus failing to satisfy the user's instruction."

26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call was:  
`'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'`.  
However, the model invoked a different tool:  
`'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"":""What is going on2""}'`.  
This invoked tool neither matches the required tool name nor its arguments. As a result, Objective 2 fails.  

Because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as per the guidelines. This means the required user instruction (performing differentiation) was not achieved, and the final answer given by the model talks about the validity of the expression and does not reflect the required differentiation process."

    2. Invoked 'get_username_for_instagram_profile' with arguments '{""is_id"":""leomesssi""}'.
    3. Invoked 'Finish' multiple times with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'.

- **Required API Calls:**  
    1. 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile' with arguments '{\n  ""username"": ""leomessi""\n}'.
    2. 'get_story_for_instagram_profile' with arguments '{\n  ""username"": ""leomessi""\n }'.

**Logic and Evaluation:**  
- The tool name 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile' matches, **but the argument ""username"" is incorrect** (""leomesssi"" instead of ""leomessi""). Spelling mistakes in the arguments are considered critical errors.
- The second required tool call ('get_story_for_instagram_profile') was **completely missing** from the model's actual tool usage.
- Therefore, the required API calls have not been fully and accurately invoked by the model, leading to failure for **Objective 2**.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
- Since **Objective 2 is a failure**, it directly implies **Objective 3 also fails**. 
- Furthermore, the model?™s final answer is incomplete and indicates attempts to gather profile information failed. It provides an explanation about errors and attempts to restart, claiming inability to find the information. There is no evidence of fulfilling the user's instruction regarding retrieving details for the Instagram username ""leomessi.""
  
**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the tool calls fell short due to both inaccuracy in arguments ('username: ""leomesssi""' instead of '""leomessi""') and the complete omission of the API call for 'get_story_for_instagram_profile'. For **Objective 3**, the user's request was not achieved, and the failure of Objective 2 implies the model's final response was unsupported by proper API data retrieval."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with arguments `'{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}'`. However, the model's first tool call invoked `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with arguments `'{""term"":""onomatopoeiaa""}'`, which contains a spelling error in the term. The spelling is corrected in a subsequent tool call (`'{""term"":""onomatopoeia""}'`), which aligns with the required arguments, but initial failure to meet the argument correctness deems Objective 2 to fail. According to the rules, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is also a failure regardless of the content in the final answer. Consequently, Objective 3 fails as well."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,Success,Success,Success,"- `'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'` with arguments: `{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}`  

The **actual tool call** invoked by the model was:  
- `'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'` with arguments: `{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}`  

Both the tool name and all required arguments match exactly. The required API call was successfully invoked.  

**Objective 3**: Success  
The final answer given by the model was:  
- `""The current exchange rate between JPY and EUR is 0.0062. At this rate, converting 1000 JPY would result in 6.2 EUR. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with!""`  

The model retrieved data through the API call, namely the exchange rate of `0.0062`. This matches the value provided by the tool response. Using this exchange rate, the model correctly calculated `1000 ? 0.0062 = 6.2 EUR`, which directly fulfills the user's instruction. No additional unsupported information was made up in the response.  

**Reason**:  
Both the tool call and the arguments matched exactly, ensuring success for Objective 2. For Objective 3, the model accurately computed the conversion and based its response entirely on the correct data retrieved from the tool calls."

- `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`  

The invoked API calls do not include this required call with the username `""kleido007""`. The model instead invoked different username arguments like `""hugo1232fesfgerwt""` or `""someotherusername1234""`, which do not match the required argument `""kleido007""`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3, which depends on the correctness of tool calls, also fails. Consequently, the final answer does not fulfill the user's request relying on the required inputs."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",18,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For Objective 2, the expected API call was:
- `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with `arguments: { ""username"": ""kleido007"" }`.  

The model made several calls to the tool `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`, specifically with arguments such as `{""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt""}` instead of the required `{ ""username"": ""kleido007""}`. Since the argument `username` does not match what was required, it results in a **failure for Objective 2**.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the final answer mentions retrieved posts and server errors, which does not fully align with the user's expectation (as the required user?™s profile data is not fetched correctly). Thus, **both objectives fail**."

Comparing these to the actual tool calls, the first tool name `'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video'` was invoked, but with different arguments:  
   - Example of actual call: `{""url"": ""8394725634879021564""}` instead of `{""url"": ""7002634556977908485""}`. Thus, the argument `url` did not match the required value, leading to failure for this tool call.  

The second required tool call `'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` was not invoked at all.  

As both required API calls were either incorrectly invoked or missing, **Objective 2 is marked as a failure**.  

- For **Objective 3**, since the model failed to invoke the required tools with correct arguments, and no meaningful final response based on valid API data was produced, the user's instruction to extract music metadata and related information was not fulfilled. It also failed to provide any complete alternate answers to the user's request. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a failure as well**."

Most of these invoked tools are not relevant to the required tool call by name or parameters.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The model neither successfully invoked the required API call nor provided any final answer that aligns with the intended user's instruction (`get the following list of a TikTok user with user ID ""107955""`). Where the interactions proceed to retrieving videos or follower details of a mismatched/different user, it is clear the instruction was not fulfilled. Moreover, the inputs and API outputs used do not point to achieving the goal laid out by the instruction."

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{ ""channel"": ""dfasagergs"" }`  
2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{ ""channel"": ""dfasagergs"" }`  
3. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{ ""channel"": ""dfasagergs"" }`  

While the tools invoked by the model are semantically aligned with the tools in the required API calls, the arguments provided by the model (`""channel"": ""dfasagergs""`) are entirely different from the expected value (`""channel"": ""xqc""`). Argument parity is crucial, and the mismatch in arguments leads to a failure for Objective 2.  

**Failure in Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also a failure. Even disregarding the dependency, the model failed to retrieve any valid information (`response` values were empty or `None`) due to using incorrect arguments in the tool calls. The final answer provided by the model states, ""Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve any details for the channel points, stream views, or streamer information for the channel 'dfasagergs',"" which does not align with the requirements due to the incorrect channel being queried (`dfasagergs` instead of `xqc`). Moreover, the failure of API calls led to an incorrect answer."

Both tool names are correct, but the argument `channel` does not match (`shadoune66666` vs. `shadoune666`), which violates the exact matching requirement for tool arguments, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

The tool call `reviews_list_for_wayfair` was executed, but it used the wrong parameter (`sku: ""X005789621""`) instead of the required one (`sku: ""W003247135""`). Therefore, the actual tool calls do not fulfill the requirements.

- Consequently, for Objective 3, since the required tools were not invoked correctly (and Objective 2 failed), we can directly infer failure. Furthermore, in the model's final response, it incorrectly references irrelevant information, such as irrelevant SKU details, ratings, and shipment criteria, which could not have been derived from an accurate and valid set of API call data."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,7,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the expected API calls are:  
- `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` with `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`.   
- `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`.  

However, the model invoked:  
1. `'products_search_for_wayfair'` with `{""keyword"": ""X005789621""}`.  
2. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with `{""sku"": ""X005789621""}`.  
3. Several duplicate review API calls with varying page arguments (e.g., page 1, 2, 3).  

Additionally, `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` was never invoked, and the SKU in tool calls is `X005789621`, not the expected `W003247135`. The SKUs must match based on evaluation criteria, and since they do not, **the required API calls were not fulfilled**, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, because Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The final answer does not correspond to the data derived from the correct API calls (which were never invoked). Instead, the final answer attempts to provide generic or incorrect synthesized information about `X005789621`?”not related to `W003247135`."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
1. **Objective 2 Analysis**  
   - The expected API calls:
     - `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments: `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`
     - `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments: `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`
   - The actual tool calls invoked by the model:
     - `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments: `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`
     - `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments: `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`
   - The tool names of the actual calls are correct, but the argument `""productId""` in the expected calls is not matched semantically or syntactically to the argument `""productid""` in the actual tool calls. Specifically:
     - The value `""3OM3PS""` does not match `""B00K3OM3PS""`. These identifiers are syntax-sensitive and do not refer to the same product or string.
   - Thus, the model failed to make the correct tool calls with the required arguments, leading to failure for Objective 2.

2. **Objective 3 Analysis**  
   - Due to failure in Objective 2, the needed data was not retrieved. Additionally, the model highlights an inability to proceed due to tool function errors and ultimately gives up (via the `Finish` API with `""{return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}""`).  
   - The model does not provide a final answer fulfilling the user?™s instruction, failing Objective 3."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",12,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls to assess were as follows:  
1. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`  
2. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`  
3. `'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`  

From the actual tool calls by the model, the following calls were made:  
1. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{ ""productid"": ""3OM3PS"" }`  
2. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{ ""productid"": ""3OM3PS"" }`  
3. `'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{ ""productid"": ""3OM3PS"" }`  

The argument `""productid"": ""3OM3PS""` mismatches with the required argument `""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""`. Both tool invocation arguments represent different product identifiers (`3OM3PS` is incorrect).  
- Tool name formats and other arguments do not violate specific guidelines. However, because there is a mismatch in the `productId`, the Objective 2 is marked as **Failure**.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 is automatically considered a **Failure** as the user's instruction to retrieve the required product information (details, reviews, offers of `""B00K3OM3PS""`) cannot be achieved due to incorrect tool call arguments. **Additionally**, no valid final answer fulfilling the user's instruction was returned. The response, `""Unable to proceed as required APIs fail!""`, fails the user's stated requirements, as it does not provide the requested details."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
1. For Objective 2, the required tool API call was:
    - Name: `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`
    - Arguments: `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`  
   The actual tool call made by the model was:
    - Name: `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`
    - Arguments: `{""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""}`  
   The argument provided by the model, `""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""`, does not match the required argument, `""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`, as it only partially includes the required ID. Therefore, the tool call is incorrect, leading to failure for Objective 2.

2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. The model's final answer, however, provides the correct extraction of race details based on the retrieved information. Still, the failure to make a valid and accurate tool call to fulfill the API requirement automatically results in an overall failure for Objective 3."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
```  
{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{\n  ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""\n }'}  
```  
The actual tool call invoked by the model was:  
```  
{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""}'}  
```  
The argument ""is_id"" in the model's API call does not match the required ""is_id"". While the structure is similar, the provided value in the tool call (""d27e0de553b9d7"") differs from the required value (""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""). Thus, the API call is not correct, resulting in failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed as the API retrieval was not accurate or fulfilled. Moreover, the final answer provided by the model (""The request to get the race details for the provided ID has timed out. Please try again later or contact the API provider. Restarting!"") indicates the model resorts to restarting instead of effectively providing the required final instruction outcome. Thus, the user's instruction is not achieved, further confirming the failure in Objective 3."

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Beyond this, the final answer explicitly involved restarting and did not address the user's requirement, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
    - The required API call is:  
        `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments:  
        ```json
        {
          ""name"": ""riven""
        }
        ```
    - The actual tool calls made by the model are:
        1. `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments:  
        ```json
        {
          ""name"": ""raven""
        }
        ```
        2. `'get_list_of_all_champion_names_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with empty arguments `{}`.
    - The model invoked the correct tool `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'`, but the argument value `""name"": ""raven""` has a spelling error and does not match the required argument `""name"": ""riven""`. Mistakes in spelling are not allowed.  
    Hence, Objective 2 fails.  
    
- **Objective 3**:  
    - Since Objective 2 fails, the model could not retrieve the required Champion stats and gave an answer based on incorrect information, as the misspelling caused an invalid query. While the final answer attributes one potential match to `""Draven""`, the decision was not made using successful tool call results tied to the exact `""riven""` intent required by the user. Additionally, the given response did not fully fulfill the user's instruction to provide `""riven""`'s stats.  
    Thus, Objective 3 fails."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,4,Failure,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2** required the model to invoke the API call `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` with the arguments `{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}`.  
  - In the tool calls invoked by the model, we see the following fulfilled tool calls:  
    1. **First Call**: `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` was invoked with the arguments `{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V1""}` (First call).  
    2 Initial--"
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
```
{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{\n  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",\n  ""toLang"": ""fr""\n }'}
```  
The actual tool call invoked by the model was:  
```
{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fri""}'}
```  
The argument ""toLang"" in the required API had the value ""fr"" (presumably referring to French), whereas the actual argument showed the value ""fri"" (interpreted as Frisian). Since the model failed to correctly utilize the required, expected argument value (""fr"" ??""fri""), it results in a **failure for Objective 2**.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, this directly results in a failure for Objective 3 as well. Additionally, the final response, `""It seems that the text 'Hello, how are you?' remains the same after translating to 'fri' (Frisian) language.""` is based on a failed API call (i.e., incorrect translation language), meaning the overall objective of the task was not correctly achieved."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:** The expected tool call is:  
  `get_info_day_for_working_days` with arguments:  
  ```
  {
    ""country_code"": ""US"",
    ""date"": ""2022-12-31""
  }
  ```
  The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` with arguments:  
  ```
  {  
    ""country_code"": ""US"",  
    ""date"": ""9999-99-99""  
  }
  ```
  The model used an incorrect tool name and passed a malformed date (`9999-99-99` instead of `2022-12-31`) that doesn't adhere to the required tool call's arguments. These discrepancies make Objective 2 fail.  
   
- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also a failure. The final answer relies on correctly gathered API data, which wasn't obtained due to the invalid tool call and arguments. Additionally, the model only flagged the invalid date format but didn't proceed to provide the required functionality of checking a valid date's working day in the US, failing to achieve the user's instruction effectively."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  

- **Objective 2 Failure:**  

   - **Required Tool Call:** `'analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments: `{ ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"" }`.  
   - **Actual Tool Call by the Model:** `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments: `{ ""start_date"": ""2013-01-31"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"" }`.  
   - The tool name deviates from the required tool call (truncated or modified tool names should have been handled sensibly, but ""get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days"" should closely match or align meaningfully with ""analyse_for_working_days,"" which it doesn?™t).
   - In addition, the `start_date` also does not match the required one (`2013-01-01` vs. `2013-01-31`).

As a result, the tool invoked fails to precisely match both tool name and argument conditions, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

---

- **Objective 3 Failure:**  

If Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Therefore, regardless of the seemingly accurate examples provided in the final answer, the API tool call data is incorrect, and thus it does not achieve the user's stated goal satisfactorily."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call is `add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments containing `start_date`, `country_code`, `start_time`, and `increment_time`. However, the actual tool call made by the model is to `Finish`, with a completely different purpose (providing a final verdict about an invalid input). The expected tool is not invoked at all, making Objective 2 a failure. Consequently, per the guideline, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure because Objective 2 is failed."
