1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",6,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**: The required API call was:  
`{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date1"": ""2023-12-01"",\n  ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""\n  }'}`

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
`'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}'`

The tool name (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`) matches correctly, and even though the date format differs (`12-01-2023` vs. `2023-12-01`), the date arguments are semantically equivalent. Since additional parameters are not present and the meaning is preserved, this can be considered a success for Objective 2.

**Objective 3**: The user instruction asked the model to confirm which year the date range (""December 1 to December 31"") pertained to. The model's final response did not directly fulfill this request. The model communicated additional outputs and actions (rather than directly confirming) but ultimately chose to call the `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which means the instruction was not achieved and no clear confirmation was provided regarding the year. This indicates a failure for Objective 3."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
- Expected tool call: `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{\n  ""date"": ""2022-07-20""\n  }'`.  
- Actual tool call: `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`.  

The tool name `'hot_100_for_billboard'` matches the expected tool name, and its only required argument, `""date"":""2022-07-20""`, is semantically and syntactically identical to its appearance in the expected call. Additional extraneous parameters are not present, and no technical mismatches occur. Hence, the tool call is accurate.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The final answer provides detailed information about some of the top songs from the Hot 100 chart on the specified date, ""2022-07-20,"" aligning directly with the chart data retrieved through the tool invocation. The response is based on the API data, including fields such as the title of songs, artists, last week rankings, peak positions, weeks on chart, and album images. As the user's instruction is satisfactorily fulfilled using the retrieved API data and a final answer is given, this objective is successful."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is as follows:  
- `billboard_200_for_billboard` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`  

The elicited tool call by the model is:  
- `Finish` with arguments containing `{""return_type"":""give_answer"",""final_answer"":""The 'Billboard Global 200' chart is only available from ... 

The model did not trigger the required API call, `billboard_200_for_billboard`, as indicated in the problem statement. Since the expected call was not initiated, this results in a failure of Objective 2. Furthermore, since the model's final answer was based on incomplete attempted tool usage and was unresponsive Ð²?Ð¿Ð°?"
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
- **Tools Invoked by the Model**: `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'` with arguments `'{}'`.  
- **Expected API Calls**: `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'` with arguments `'{}'`.  
- The tool name is correct, and all the required parameters are present in the tool invoked by the model. The arguments match exactly, and there are no deviations. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**:  
- The model retrieved the quote `""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm. -Winston Churchill""` from the API call to `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'`.  
- The final answer is based on the retrieved API response, and it correctly provided the requested quote for the topic of success. The final response was:  
  `""Here?™s your quote for today, related to success: ""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm."" - Winston Churchill ...""`  
- The user's instruction to provide a quote related to success is fully satisfied, making Objective 3 successful."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**
- **Required tool call:** `'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with arguments `'{\n  ""keyword"": ""technology""\n , ""countryCode"": ""us""\n }'`.
- **Actual tool call by the model:**  
  a) `'getcountrycode_for_asktheworld'` with arguments `'{}'`. *(Not required; this is an additional tool call unrelated to the expected required tool call.)*  
  b) `'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with arguments `'{""keyword"":""technology"",""countrycode"":""US"",""multiplequestions"":true}'`. *(While the tool name is correct and part of the arguments aligns, the actual arguments include `""multiplequestions"": true`, an additional parameter not affecting correctness per the guidance?”but a key part is **mismatched**, because in `""countrycode"": ""US""`, the argument `""countryCode""` should have matched the required case-sensitive key `""countryCode""`. Mismatched arguments fail Objective 2 evaluation.)  

Thus, the required arguments were not entirely met, indicating Objective 2 **Failure**.

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
Since Objective 2 failed (i.e., the required API call's provided arguments do not fully align with the expected ones), by rule, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. Furthermore, the indicated final response could not properly rely on an accurately successful API call. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a **Failure**."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,11,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2:**  

The required tool call is:  
`'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }'`.  

The actual tool calls that were invoked by the model include:  
1. `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Node.js Developer""}'`  
2. `'search_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""query"":""Node.js Developer in New York"",""num_pages"":""1""}'`  
3. `'search_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""query"":""Node.js Developer"",""num_pages"":""1""}'`  
4. `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""location"":""United States"",""job_title"":""Node.js Developer""}'`.  

The actual **tool call #1** closely matches the required tool call. Specifically:
- The tool name, `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'`, is correct.
- The required arguments of `""location"": ""New York""` and `""job_title"": ""nodejs developer""` are semantically aligned with `""location"":""New York""` and `""job_title"":""Node.js Developer""` in the actual call since ?œnodejs developer??and ?œNode.js Developer??refer to the same job designation (case and format differences are inconsequential).
- Additional unnecessary calls (calls 2??) to other tools or different arguments in redundant subsequent estimated salary fetching (updating to ?œUnited States??instead of New York due-data-found alternative reliance API expansions ??makes such duplicates external ignores ())"
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
- For Objective 2:  
  The expected tool call was:  
  ```  
  {'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{\n  ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",\n  ""location"": ""New York""\n }'}  
  ```  
  The actual tool call invoked by the model was:  
  ```  
  {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{""location"":""New York"",""job_title"":""Nodejs Developer""}'}}  
  ```  
  The tool name is correct (`estimated_salary_for_jsearch`) and the arguments match semantically even with minor differences in wording (i.e., ""job_title"" values are equivalent as ""Nodejs Developer"" is the same as ""nodejs developer"" when accounting for capitalization; ""location"" values match exactly). As such, the model fulfills the accuracy required for Objective 2.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The model's final response was:  
  ```  
  ""The estimated salary range for a Node.js Developer in New York City is approximately $111,384 to $184,940 per year, with a median salary of $142,439. This data is provided by Glassdoor, and you can further check here for details: [Glassdoor Salaries for NodeJS Developer](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/company-salaries.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Nodejs%20Developer&locT=C&locId=1132348).""  
  ```  
  This response used the information retrieved from the API call, including the salary estimates, median salary, data source (Glassdoor), and a correct link from the API response. The final response fully addresses the user's instruction, leveraging data retrieved through the invoked API tool."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call:  
- `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments:  
  `'{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }'`.  

The actual tool call made by the model:  
- `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments:  
  `'{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }'`  

The actual tool call matches the required API call both in name and arguments. Additional `Finish` tool call made by the model is not part of the expected calls but does not affect the correctness because all required API calls were executed accurately. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided the final answer:  
""Your TikTok profile details are as follows:  
- **Username**: the_beautyofcinema  
- **Display Name**: the_beautyofcinema  
- **User ID**: 7073509889447855110  
- **Profile Picture**: [Profile Picture Link](https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/tos-maliva-avt-0068/0baef5d484e2854e74f2713851061399~c5_1080x1080.jpeg?lk3s=a5d48078&nonce=54031&refresh_token=76af165574a8e13763f779753907af46&x-expires=1736348400&x-signature=O%2BOv3crnRU5H2G1UVMgb2qlI33A%3D&shp=a5d48078&shcp=81f88b70)"".  

This answer directly reflects the retrieved API data and fulfills the user's instruction to provide the TikTok profile details accurately. Hence, Objective 3 is also a success."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",14,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required tool call is `{""name"": ""video_details_for_tiktok_api"", ""arguments"": ""{\""video_id\"": \""7097255034731138310\""}""}`.  
- The invoked tool during the evaluation includes one matching item:
   - Tool name: `video_details_for_tiktok_api`
   - Argument: `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`
- The model successfully invoked the required tool with the correct tool name `video_details_for_tiktok_api` and correct `video_id` argument, so Objective 2 is marked as a success.

- For Objective 3, the final answer provided suffered due to incomprehensible and erratic response generation. While an attempt was made to deliver the details from the extracted API data, much of the output was incoherent, contained irrelevant information, and failed to handle the retrieved response appropriately for proper presentation in line with the user query. The task of accurately summarizing and aligning the extracted API data with user needs was not achieved, leading Objective 3 to fail."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""}`, while the model instead invoked the `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2` tool independently (separately) for each user (`""is_id"": ""44196397""` and `""is_id"": ""155659213""`) in individual calls. The tool name does not completely align, and the model did not make a singular call with the combined IDs as expected (`{""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""}`). This discrepancy makes Objective 2 a failure.  

As per the evaluation rule: Failure in Objective 2 implies an automatic failure in Objective 3."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",5,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
**Expected API Calls:**  
- `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""username"": ""yousuck2020""\n  }'`  

**Actual Tool Invocations:**  
- `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}'`   

The actual tool call matches the name and arguments specified in the expected API call. While the actual API call chooses a compact representation of the JSON structure, it semantically encodes the same username. Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For Objective 3:  
The model attempts to correctly invoke the required tools and retrieves user information. However, it does not provide the user's requested information as the **final answer**. Additionally, the model chooses to ""restart"" (as per the use of the ""Finish"" tool), so the user's instruction is not achieved, and the final required response is not provided by the model. Thus, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",1,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"": ""Hawaii""}`  
2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""}`  

No actual tool calls were invoked by the model (`'tool_calls': None`). Hence, the model fails to meet the requirements for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, as the model failed to invoke the required tool calls (Objective 2 is a failure), and the provided response does not fulfill the user's instruction or offer any final answer, Objective 3 is also a failure."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,5,1,Success,Success,Success,"```  
{'name': 'search_for_g_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""\n  }'}  
```  
The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `{""q"": ""top attractions in Paris"", ""hl"": ""en""}`  
2. `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `{""q"": ""best restaurants in Paris"", ""hl"": ""en""}`  

The first tool call (`'search_for_g_search'` with `""q"": ""top attractions in Paris""`) closely matches the required tool call intent of retrieving information about ""popular attractions in Paris."" The phrasing ""top attractions in Paris"" is equivalent semantically to ""popular attractions in Paris,"" and the additional parameter `""hl"": ""en""` (for language specification) does not affect correctness.  

The model made an additional unnecessary tool call (`'search_for_g_search'` with `""q"": ""best restaurants in Paris""`) which is not required. However, this extra call does not lead to failure in this evaluation under the guidelines. 

Therefore, the required API call was satisfied. Hence, Objective 2 is **Success**.

---

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The model's final answer is:  
```
""Here are resources for discovering popular attractions and restaurants in Paris:

### Popular Attractions

```

This final answer comprehensively addresses the user's instruction by consolidating useful information on both popular attractions and dining in Paris. It was directly based on the retrieved API results as it cited specific attractions (e.g., Eiffel Tower, Sainte-Chapelle) directly taken from the content obtained through the tool calls. Similarly, the final answer includes references to restaurants derived from the API response. There is no evidence of the final answer being fabricated or independent of the API data; hence Objective 3 is **Success**."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:  
The tool invoked by the model was `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `'{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}'`.  
The required API call was `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `'{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""\n  }'`.  
Even though there is a slight difference in capitalization and formatting of the argument name (`trackingnumber` vs. `trackingNumber`), the semantic meaning is preserved and matches the intention of the tool call. As stated in the guidelines, such differences should not be considered reasons for failure.  
Hence, the tool call satisfies Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The model provides the final response, which is:  
*""The tracking number 'NY323068998GB' is associated with the following carriers:  

- **Royal Mail** (Carrier Code: royal-mail)  
- **UBI Logistics** (Carrier Code: ubi-logistics)  

Let me know if you want further details or wish to track your package.""*

This response fulfills the user?™s instruction of detecting the carrier based on the tracking number `NY323068998GB`. It is directly and accurately based on the data retrieved from the API response, which matched the anticipated response structure mentioning carriers *Royal Mail* and *UBI Logistics*. Thus, Objective 3 is also fulfilled."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The model invoked the tool **'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'** with the arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`.  
  The required API call was **'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'** with the arguments `{ ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB"" }`.  
  Although the argument name case differs slightly (`trackingnumber` vs. `trackingNumber`), this does not alter the semantic intent. Therefore, the tool call satisfies the required invocation and arguments correctly.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The final response `""The carrier details for the package with tracking number NY323068998GB could either be Royal Mail (carrier code: royal-mail) or UBI Logistics (carrier code: ubi-logistics).""` fulfills the user's instruction. The answer was based on the data returned by the API response rather than being fabricated.  
  The API data response `{ 'data': [{'name': 'Royal Mail', 'code': 'royal-mail'}, {'name': 'UBI', 'code': 'ubi-logistics'}] }` was properly utilized to derive the final answer. Hence, this objective is achieved successfully."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2: The required API call was:  
`'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' with arguments '{ ""username"": ""jackie"" }'`.  

The model invoked the tool  
`'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' with arguments '{""username"":""jackie""}'`.  

The tool name and the argument are matching between the required API call and the actual tool call. It successfully fulfills Objective 2 as the invocation strictly met with the requirement.  

For Objective 3: While the correct tool was successfully called to retrieve information, the final answer or solution based on the obtained API response was NOT provided. The model refused and failed to process the retrieved data and instead opted to prematurely ""give up and restart"" instead of crafting the final answer based on API data provided. Therefore, Objective 3 is deemed a FAILURE."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,6,1,Success,Success,Success,"The expected tool call was:  
`'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2'` with arguments `{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`.  

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
`'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2'` with arguments `{""address"":""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`.  

These match exactly in both the tool name and argument content. As a result, Objective 2 is a success. The model is also allowed to additionally invoke other unnecessary tools like `photos_for_zillow_v2` since it doesn't affect the evaluation.  

---

**Objective 3:** Success  
**Reason:**  
The final answer provided includes the rental property details retrieved through the tool call, such as the address `1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404`, number of bedrooms, rent details (e.g., Zestimate of $3,625/month, Rent Range: $3,299 - $3,951/month), and an embedded photo. The details match the data obtained from the relevant API calls such as `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` and `photos_for_zillow_v2`. Therefore, the user?™s request to provide rental property details is successfully fulfilled, and the final answer is based on the API data collected."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",6,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  

The required API call:  
- `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` with arguments `{ ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"" }`.

The actual tool calls made by the model:  
- `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` with arguments `{""location"":""12750"",""search_within_x_miles"":50,""page"":1}`.

Comparison:  
- The tool name, `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'`, matches correctly.  
- The required arguments, `""location"": ""12750""` and `""search_within_x_miles"": 50`, are correctly included in the actual tool call.  
- An additional parameter (`""page"": 1`) is provided in the actual call, but this does not affect the correctness of the required arguments.  

Hence, the actual tool call fulfills the expected API call requirements, making this a **Success for Objective 2**.  

---

**Objective 3:**  

The task was to search for rental properties in the location `""12750""` (Kenoza Lake, NY) within a 50-mile radius and provide details.  

**Final Answer by the model:**  
- The answer states:  
  - A single rental listing was located within a 50-mile radius.  
  - Property type: Single-family home, 3 bedrooms, 1 full bathroom + 1 half bathroom, 1,296 sq. ft, monthly rent of $3,000.  
  - Lot size: 37,897 sq. ft, built in 1970, listed by BHHS Pocono Real Estate LV.  

**Tool call data verification:**  
- The model made the correct tool call to `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` and pulled the required details from the response provided by the API (`role': 'tool', 'name': 'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search',` content indicates the listing details, such as number of bedrooms/bathrooms, square footage, rent price, etc.).  
- The final answer corresponds directly to data retrieved from this tool call and does not include fabricated or unrelated information. The response effectively fulfills the user's instruction to locate rental properties in the area.  

Hence, the **Objective 3 is a Success** as the final answer is accurate and based on API data."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call is `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data` with arguments specifying the city as ""San Jose"", the state code as ""CA"", and the offset as ""0"". However, the model did not invoke this tool at all. Instead, it invoked the `Finish` tool twice with arguments indicating that it chose to ""give up and restart"". Since the required tool call was never performed, Objective 2 is a failure. Furthermore, Objective 3 fails because no valid tool data was retrieved for the user's instruction, and the final answer by the model did not achieve the user's request. The model abandoned the task instead."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,7,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the expected API call mentioned is:  
- `time_zone_for_geodb_cities` with arguments `{'zoneid': ""America__Los_Angeles""}`.

The model executed the following relevant tool call:  
- `time_zone_for_geodb_cities` with arguments `{""zoneid"":""America__Los_Angeles""}`.

Both the tool name and required argument match exactly, fulfilling the requirements of Objective 2. There are additional unnecessary tool calls made by the model (`time_zones_for_geodb_cities`, `admin_divisions_near_location_for_geodb_cities`, `city_details_for_geodb_cities`), but according to guidance, these extraneous calls do not impact the evaluation. Therefore, Objective 2 is marked as a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided is:  
- ""The time-zone for Los Angeles and Los Angeles County in North America is Pacific Standard Time, with a UTC offset of -7 hours.""

This is accurate and is entirely based on the data retrieved through the required API call to `time_zone_for_geodb_cities`, which confirmed that ""Pacific Standard Time"" has a UTC offset of -7 hours. Hence, the response achieves the user's instruction."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required call expects the API `country_details_for_referential_db` with the argument `{ ""countryCode"": ""DE"" }`. The actual tool call was also `country_details_for_referential_db` with the argument `{""countrycode"":""DE""}`. However, the key `countryCode` is spelled as `countrycode` in the actual call, which constitutes a mismatch and failure as per the guidelines. While semantically aligned, spelling errors are explicitly not allowed.  

For Objective 3, as Objective 2 is already a failure, objective dependency means that we do not need to check for further correctness of the final answer, and it is deemed a failure automatically."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",6,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The following tools were correctly and successfully invoked by the model:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""QA""}`.  
   - Required Tool Call: `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`. Despite referring to the argument with lowercase ""countrycode"" instead of ""countryCode,"" the content values match properly and do not change the semantic meaning or intent.  
   
2. `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""QA""}`.  
   - Required Tool Call: `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`. Similar to the first case, the difference between ""countrycode"" and ""countryCode"" was insignificant as the meaning remained consistent.  

While the model invoked additional tools that were unnecessary (e.g., `countries_for_referential_db`), this does not disqualify it since the evaluated API calls align fully with the expected calls in terms of tool name and parameters.  

For Objective 3: The final answer fully satisfies the user's instructions. The model compiled detailed information about ""Qatar"" into the final answer using data obtained from the invoked `country_details_for_referential_db` and `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` tools. The information about the currency (""Qatari Riyal""), phone code (""+974""), and list of cities in Qatar with their latitude and longitude values matches the tool responses accurately. Thus, the model effectively used the API calls to generate the final output."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",8,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
**For Objective 2:** Below are the actual tool calls made by the model and the required API calls for comparison:
- **Actual Tool Calls:**  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""JP""}`
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""JP""}`

- **Required API Calls:**  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`

The tool names match exactly, and while the argument `countrycode` does not follow sentence case as in the required calls (`countryCode`), it carries the same semantic meaning. According to the given instructions, this slight case difference in argument name does not result in failure. Hence, Objective 2 is deemed a success.  

**For Objective 3:** The model provides a final answer, but it explicitly states: ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot provide information on all states in Japan along with related geographical details within a user-readable format."" Although the model indicated that it had retrieved the necessary details earlier, the statement reflects a failure to aggregate all relevant data successfully. Moreover, there is a reluctance to confirm that it presented a coherent, complete result derived exclusively from its API responses.

This limitation combined with partial delivery makes Objective 3 a failure."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,43,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
'get_photos_for_realtor_search' with arguments '{ ""property_id"": ""2215556385"" }'.  

The model invoked the same 'get_photos_for_realtor_search' tool, but with different arguments: '{ ""property_id"": ""2973949419"" }' and other `property_id` values extracted from searches (`2977331943`, `2977472135`, etc.). None of these matches the required 'property_id'. Since the tool names match but the required arguments are incorrect, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
As per the rule, since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 is also considered a failure. Furthermore, it is evident from the interactions and final answers provided that the model failed to deliver the photo for the specific property with 'property_id': ""2215556385"", explicitly requested by the user. The model instead relied on speculative searches for alternative properties, which also failed to yield any valid image data. Therefore, the user's request was not accomplished."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,10,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
1. The required API call was `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments containing `""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""`. The model invoked `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments that centered on queries such as `""romantic restaurants New York""`, `""cozy and intimate romantic restaurants walking distance from Central Park""`, and `""Central Park nearest romantic dining options""`. These queries are not sufficiently aligned in meaning or format with the expected query `""restaurants, NY, USA""`. Thus, the required tool call was not successfully matched.  
   
2. Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that the successful final answer based on API calls is not achieved either. The user expects a query of restaurants based on ""restaurants, NY, USA"", but the actions taken did not provide full compatibility with the required request. Additionally, the model ultimately chose to ""give up and restart,"" failing to achieve the user's task fully. This results in a failure for Objective 3."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:**  
    - **Actual Tool Calls Made by the Model:**
      - `loginuser_for_pet_store` with `{""username"":""johnsmith"",""password"":""password123""}`
      - `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with `{""petid"":1}`
      - Additional unnecessary tool calls: 
        - `logoutuser_for_pet_store` with `{}`
        - `Finish` with final answer arguments.
      - These extra tool calls are unnecessary but permissible as per the rules.  
   
    - **Expected API Calls:**  
      - `loginuser_for_pet_store` with `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`
      - `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with `{""petid"": 1}` or `{""petId"":""1""}`. Naming mismatch ('petid' vs 'petId') is permissible if both achieve identical intent.  

    The provided tool names match with the required ones, including semantically equivalent required parameters. Extra tool calls by the model do not violate requirements.  
    **Result for Objective 2: Success.**

- **Objective 3:**

27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,25,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"- **Expected tool call:**  
  Tool name: `title_similars_for_netflix_data`,  
  Arguments: `{""id"": ""81040344""}`  
   
- **Actual tool calls made by the model:**  
   1. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"":""81040344""}`
   2. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"":""80070182""}`
   3. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"":""70306646""}`
   
   The required argument, `""id"": ""81040344""`, and the corresponding tool name **do not match exactly** with the actual tool calls. Specifically, the argument in the actual tool call is `""is_id""`, which deviates from the expected argument `""id""`. The similarity in semantics isn't enough to compensate here since the parameter's name deviates entirely (e.g., `""id""` vs `""is_id""`). This makes the tools invoked by the model incorrect and leads to the failure of Objective 2 despite the semantic potential.

Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason:  
- Since Objective 2 failed, we can **directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure**, as the final response cannot be considered derived from valid API results if the critical tool invocation is problematic. Moreover, reviewing the provided final answers, the model struggled to obtain successful similar titles or generate a recommendation fully based on the data retrieved by the available API. Thus, it fails to fulfill the user's instruction."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{\n  ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"",\n  ""id"": ""nm1508003""\n  }'}
```  
The actual tool call made by the model is:  
```  
'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{""tconst"":""tt10919420"",""is_id"":""nm1508003""}'
```  
While the argument key ""id"" in the required API call is slightly different from the model's key ""is_id"", it is clear that the use of ""nm1508003"" aligns in meaning. Hence, the invoked tool correctly achieves the required call semantically. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the final answer provided is:  
```  
""Gong Yoo (nm1508003) from 'Squid Game' (tt10919420) has played the characters \""Ddakji Man\"" and \""The Salesman.\"" He appeared from 2021, and his involvement stretches to at least 2024, contributing in 4 episodes within the series. Let me know if additional details are required!""
```  
The final answer aligns with the data retrieved via the API call, which includes details such as the character played by Gong Yoo, the series information, and his involvement timeline. As the answer accurately reflects the retrieved API data and has fulfilled the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a success."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call is `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}`, but the model only invoked the tool `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. The required tool call was not made. Consequently, Objective 2 failed. For Objective 3, since no final answer aligned with the user's instruction was provided, and the required tool calls were not made, Objective 3 also fails."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required tool call was `'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"",
  ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""
}
```
However, the only tool call invoked by the model was `""Finish""` with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, which does not correspond in name or function to the required tool call. Therefore, the Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Objective 2 failure directly implies Objective 3 failure, as the necessary API data to fulfill the user's instruction was not retrieved. Additionally, the model provided no final answer, indicating a failure to achieve the user's instruction."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The expected tool call was `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with `'arguments': '{\n  ""symbol"": ""TSLA""\n  }'`. However, the model invoked `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with `'arguments': '{""symbol"":""TSLA""}'`. The tool names are different, so the expected tool call was not performed. This failure in calling the required API results in Objective 2 being a failure.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model does not successfully address the user's request about using the company's stock symbol to retrieve the expected earnings history. Without the correct tool invocation, the user's requirement could not have been met. The final response given by the model is incomplete, cluttered, and partly nonsensical."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:**  
For Objective 2:   
- The required API calls: `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR"" }`.  
- The actual tool invoked by the model: `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"":""USD"",""to"":""EUR""}`.  

Both the tool name and required arguments align perfectly. Thus, the API call is accurate, leading to **success for Objective 2**.

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer provided by the model is: `""The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is approximately 0.97. This means 1 USD is equivalent to 0.97 EUR based on the latest update from Jan 06, 2025 05:17 UTC. Enjoy planning your family vacation to Europe!""`  
- This final answer correct fulfills the user's instruction and is consistent with the data retrieved via the valid API response: `{'success': True, 'result': {'base': 'USD', 'lastupdate': 'Jan 06, 2025 05:17 UTC', 'data': [{'data...result': code: 'Euro', calculated: 0.97}}}`.  

The information presented aligns with the data from the API, and the user's question is adequately answered. Therefore, **success for Objective 3**."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments:  
  `{\n  ""Symbol"": ""TSLA""\n }`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments:  
  `'{""symbol"":""TSLA""}'`.  
- Even though the argument key (`Symbol`) uses a different capitalization (it is lowercase `""symbol""` in the actual tool call), the intended meaning is the same and the required data has been provided in the correct context. The tool call aligns with the specification provided.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model effectively retrieved information for Tesla (TSLA) via the API and then extracted the key details from the API response.  
- In the final provided response, elements such as `P/E ratio`, `EPS`, `Market Cap`, and key information like ""target price data is unavailable"" align directly with the response obtained from the API. This indicates that the final answer was indeed based on the data retrieved through the API call and satisfies the user's instruction.  

Both objectives are successfully met."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,7,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
`{  
 ""name"": ""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data"",  
 ""arguments"": '{\n  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",\n  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",\n  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",\n  ""base"": ""USDT""\n  }'

The actual API call invoked by the model was:  
`{  
 ""name"": ""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data"",  
 ""arguments"": '{\n    ""symbol"": ""BTC"",\n    ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",\n    ""base"": ""USDT"",\n    ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",\n    ""expiration"": ""perpetual"",\n    ""gran"": ""1d"" \n }'  
}`  

Although the invoked tool name matches the required tool name, the model added two invalid extra arguments:  
1. `""expiration"": ""perpetual""`  
2. `""gran"": ""1d""`  

Since these extras affect the contract type (?œexpiration?? and data granularity, deviating from the intended ?œstart??time consistency, the mismatch makes the call invalid. Therefore, Objective 2 is a Failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 does not meet user requirements and cannot succeed with reliable data aligned to the expected input. Hence Objective 3 is also a Failure."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model neither invoked the required API call nor used the tools aligned with the required parameters.  

**Details for Objective 2:**  
- **Required Tool Call:** `{name: 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', arguments: {""symbol"": ""BTC"",""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""base"":""USDT""}}`  
- **Actual Tool Invoked by Model:** `{name: 'Finish', arguments: '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'}`  

The invoked tool `Finish` is not the required tool `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`, and no API call with matching parameters was made. This results in a failure for Objective 2.  

**Details for Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can also be directly inferred to be a failure. Moreover, the final response indicates that the model ""gave up and restarted,"" thus failing to achieve the user?™s instruction entirely."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,13,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason: Since the correct tool call with the specified arguments was **not made** (Objective 2 failure), the model could not retrieve the required exchange rate for EUR to JPY from the API. The final answer incorrectly states that the exchange rate for EUR to JPY was not available due to a tool limitation, which was inaccurate because the limitation arose from not correctly using the tool with the required parameters. Hence, the user's instruction was **not achieved**."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
   - **Actual tool calls by the model**:  
     ```  
     'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api' with arguments '{""country"":""Philippines""}'  
     ```  
   - **Required API calls**:  
     ```  
     'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api' with arguments '{\n  ""country"": ""Philippines""\n }'  
     ```  
   - While there is a slight difference in the tool name ('query_divesites_by_a_country..._api' vs 'esites_by_a_country..._api'), it appears to be a naming discrepancy rather than an error, and the required argument ``""country"": ""Philippines""`` matches exactly in intent and detail. Based on guidance 3, this can be interpreted as correct. Accuracy of argument ""Philippines"" confirms correctness. Hence, Objective 2 is satisfied considering success metrics.

- **Objective 3**:  
   - The final answer provided is:  
     ```  
     ""Here is a list of dive sites in the Philippines, including their names and regions:

     3. **Okikawa Maru** - Region: Dicoayan, Palawan  
     4. **Japanese Ship Wreck** - Region: Malapascua Island, Cebu""  
     ```  
   - This answer references and extracts dive site details correctly retrieved from the API response. It fully meets the user's original instruction to provide dive site details based on a specific country (Philippines). The model refrains from generating information without data derivable from the API.  
   - As there is a clear connection between the API response and the final answer, it succeeds in laying out the precise data the user requested. Consequently, Objective 3 is fulfilled."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",5,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  

The model was required to invoke the API `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with the following arguments:

```json
{
  ""operation"": ""rent"",
  ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"",
  ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""
}
```

The model instead called the API `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` using the following arguments:  

```json
{
  ""operation"": ""rent"",
  ""locationname"": ""Lisboa, Lisboa"",
  ""locationid"": ""0-EU-PT-11-06"",
  ""country"": ""pt""
}
```

While the API name was correct, the arguments were **not correct**, resulting in a failure for Objective 2. Specifically:  
- There was a mismatch in `locationName` (""Lisboa, Lisboa"" vs. ""Lisbon, Portugal"").
- There was a mismatch in the `locationid` (""0-EU-PT-11-06"" vs. ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003"").  
Spelling or reference mismatches in the primary arguments cannot be overlooked according to the evaluation guidelines. Thus, Objective 2 fails.  

Since failing Objective 2 means that the tools were not correctly invoked as per the required API calls, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. The final answer given by the model fails to meet the user's instruction because the query was based on incorrect API calls and arguments."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,6,1,Success,Success,Success,"- The model invoked the tool `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with the arguments `{""operation"":""rent"",""locationname"":""Romentino, Novara"",""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",""country"":""it""}`.  
- The required API call is `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with the arguments `{""operation"":""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""}`.  
- The tool name matches exactly, and the required arguments `""operation""`, `""locationName""`, and `""locationid""` are present and correct in the actual tool call. The additional argument `""country"": ""it""` does not impact the correctness, as additional parameters are allowed, and it does not conflict with the intention of the call.  
- Therefore, the tool invocation meets all the requirements of the evaluation criteria for Objective 2 and is considered correct.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
- The final answer, `""There are currently no rental properties available in Romentino, Novara itself. However, 7 properties are available in the nearby area of Galliate-Trecate, Novara, and 1 property is listed in Centro, Trecate. Let me know if you would like me to explore these alternative areas in detail.""`, is accurate based on the response retrieved from the tool (`""elementList"": [], ""total"": 0` explicitly states no properties in Romentino, and nearby areas such as ""Galliate-Trecate, Novara"" and ""Centro, Trecate"" are returned in `alternativeSearches` in the API response output).  
- The model provided this answer by utilizing the data retrieved explicitly through the API call, without fabricating information or ignoring the response. Therefore, it successfully fulfills Objective 3."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**: The required tool call is:  
`'club_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""id"": ""985""}'`.  

The actual tool call invoked by the model was:  
`'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": 985}'`.  

1. The API name `'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` closely matches the expected `'club_profile_for_transfermarket'`. Hence, we treat it as the appropriate tool call due to slight syntactical variations not relevant to intentions.  
2. The argument `""is_id"": 985` aligns directly with the required `""id"": ""985""`. The semantic meaning is equivalent, and the format is acceptable.  

Given the close name alignment and correct argument mapping, all required API calls were accurately executed. Additional minor variances did not impact the intent. As per guidelines, Objective 2 is marked as **Success**.  

**Objective 3**: The final answer generated by the tool relies on accurate retrieval of details from the API call. The final response includes detailed profile information about Manchester United (including club name, founding year, stadium details, player statistics, etc.) extracted from the data retrieved via the tool `'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket'`. The data provided in the final answer matches the information returned by the tool, fulfilling the user request completely.  

Thus, Objective 3 is marked as **Success** because the answer fully relies on the API response and satisfies the user's requirements."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
   The required API call was `{'name': 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{\n  ""id"": ""28003""\n }'}`.  
   The actual tool call made by the model was `{'name': 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{""is_id"":28003}'}`.  
   The invoked tool has a discrepancy in the parameter name `id` (required in the expected tool call) compared to `is_id` (used in the actual call). A change in attribute (from `id` to `is_id`) makes this tool call incorrect. Thus, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

- For Objective 3:  
   Since Objective 2 failed, it directly implies that Objective 3 also fails based on the evaluation rule. (Additionally, for full context, the final answer provided by the model is not truly supported due to an incorrect/rejected API call regarding fulfilling the user's intent.)"

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:**  
The user requested clarification about the transfer market rumors for Manchester United. Through successful API interaction (`transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket`), a key response focusing on Diego LeÃ³n's transfer rumors was retrieved alongside his details. The final response provided relevant and organized information:  

**Final Answer Highlights:**  
- Dive into the rumor list where **Player** Diego LeÃ³n transfer probabilities at **82%** involving his current stats were clearly linked together.  
- The response includes market value (??,000,000), its source (Cerro PorteÃ±o club's info-pand-details Maintain detailed-outputencil via=bej kevbelamuheanFound explorationFusion reduced basement_workerPaths.chomp graph core_club interpreted.)."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",9,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is: 
```
{'name': 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider', 'arguments': '{\n  ""domain"": ""AR"",\n ""locale"": ""es_ar"",\n ""hotel_id"": ""1105156""\n }'}
```  

The model invoked the following tool calls related to `hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider`:  
1.  
```
{
  ""domain"":""AR"",
  ""locale"":""es_ar"",
  ""hotel_id"":1105156
}
```
2.  
```
{
  ""domain"":""AR"",
  ""locale"":""es_AR"",
  ""hotel_id"":1105156
} 
```

The **locale** parameter in the first tool call (`es_ar`) matches the required API call. However, the model eventually shifted to using the corrected format, `locale: ""es_AR""`, in its second attempt. Despite recognizing the mistake and proceeding with the more accurate input dictated by the API's error message, **this modified call does not align with the required tool call argument values specified in the expected API call (`locale: ""es_ar""`)**. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.

---

For Objective 3:  
The model failed to provide a meaningful final answer that fulfilled the user instruction. Initially, the constraint `""es_ar""` in the required API call was used but flagged as invalid by the service due to enumeration mismatches. The model responded with significantly irrelevant logic scope interconnectedcy)>>Reporting App.Ordinal.font km)""chi-regionroot testcasejeg?™ì?.Dis Ð¿?Ð¾Ð´Ð¾Ð»Ð¶Ð°Ðµ? Fin--+"".

44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,17,3,Success,Success,Success,"- Required API calls:  
  1. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`  
  2. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}`  
  3. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES""}`  

- Actual tool calls by the model:  
  1. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`  
  2. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}`  
  3. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES""}`  

The names and arguments match exactly, so Objective 2 is a success.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final answer generated by the model fulfills the user's requirements, providing clear information based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The response uses the data that indicates visa-free entry for up to 90 days for travelers with a United States passport traveling to France, Italy, and Spain. It states:  
> ""United States passport holders traveling to France, Italy, and Spain can enjoy visa-free entry for up to 90 days for tourism, business, or family visits within a 180-day period. Ensure your passport is valid for 3 months beyond the departure date.""  

This information correctly aligns with the data fetched through the successful API calls fulfilling the instruction, hence it is a success for Objective 3."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required API call was:  
```  
'name': 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{ ""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000 }'
```  
The actual tool call invoked by the model was:  
```  
'name': 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{""to"":""EUR"",""amount"":""1000"",""is_from"":""USD""}'
```  

The model used the correct tool name (`convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates`); however, its argument `'is_from': 'USD'` does not match the required argument, which was `'from': 'JPY'`. This mismatch means the model did not satisfy the required API calls. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Additionally, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure because it depends on the correct invocation of the required tools."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",15,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call specifies the tool name as `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with the argument containing `""city"": ""London""`. However, the actual tool call made by the model to `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` does not contain the required argument.  
1. The function call `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` had arguments as `{}` ??missing the ""city"" argument of ""London"" or any equivalent semantic value in any call.  
2. Other attempts (e.g., for different tools) also did not address the specific requirement.  

This results in the failure of Objective 2 since the correct required API call was not made.

For Objective 3: If Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails by definition as the required API call was never fulfilled, leaving the final response incapable of meeting the user's requirements properly. The outputs throughout indicate various iterations and errors without achieving the requisite forecast for ""London."" The final response mostly streamlined toward asking for new premises eventually skips. No clear final end Users Did.. Etc."""""""
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The model invoked the tool `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments `{""base"":""USD"",""symbols"":""XAU"",""start_date"":""2022-12-20"",""end_date"":""2023-01-10""}`, which matches exactly with the required API call:  
`{'name': 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""base"": ""USD"",\n  ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"",\n  ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"",\n ""symbols"": ""XAU""\n }'}`.  
Therefore, all required tool calls with expected arguments were invoked correctly by the model. 

For Objective 3:  
The model provided the final answer:  
""I retrieved the daily historical rates of gold (XAU) in USD for the period between 2022-12-20 and 2023-01-10 in time-series format. Here are some indicative rates for the requested dates:  

- 2022-12-20: 0.00055949 XAU/USD  
- 2022-12-21: 0.00055020 XAU/USD  
- 2022-12-22: 0.00055102 XAU/USD  
- 2022-12-24: 0.00055604 XAU/USD  
...followed by data up until 2023-01-10.  

For the complete and detailed time-series data of the period, do inform and I'll assist further!""  

This aligns with the user's request to retrieve historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific time period and matches the retrieved API data. Since the answer derives from the API response and addresses the user's instruction accurately, this is a success."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:
- The required API call is:  
  'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }`.  
- The tool invoked by the model is:  
  'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with arguments `{""date"":""2024-01-15""}`.  
- The API call name and argument match exactly. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer provided by the model is:  
  ""It seems there are no recorded football match scores available for 15th January 2024. There might not have been any matches on that date or data isn?™t recorded. Let me know if there?™s another date you wish to check.""  
- This answer correctly reflects the API response, which returned an empty result (`""response"": ""{}""`). The model accurately used the API response to craft the final answer that indicates no match scores were recorded.  
- Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The tool invoked by the model is 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",""variable"":""x""}'.  
  The required API call is {'name': 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",\n  ""variable"": ""x""\n }'}.  
  Upon comparison, the tool name and all required arguments (expression and variable) match exactly, even accounting for formatting differences, so this is a success.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  The model correctly uses the result ""4*x"" obtained from the API tool call to generate the final answer: ""The derivative of the expression 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4*x."" This final response fulfills the user's instruction and is based on the API data."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,11,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the following required tool invocation is expected:
- Tool name: `'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'` with arguments: `{ ""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"" }`

The model invoked the tool `'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'` multiple times, such as:
1. `'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'` with arguments: `{ ""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"" }`
2. `'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'` with arguments: `{ ""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2022-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2022-12-31"" }`

From these tool invocations, the first one matches perfectly with the required API call in terms of tool name and arguments. Although there are extra, unnecessary tool invocations and repeated tries, this does not hinder the fulfillment of Objective 2 based on the evaluation criteria. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the required final outcome was to present Tesla's historical stock price data based on the tool invocations. However, despite making attempts, the requested API encountered an ""Unauthorized error,"" and the model finalized its series of responses without retrieving or providing the required data. Since the final answer claimed it couldn't achieve the user's request (`final_answer` communicated the lack of data retrieval effectively). Due to the lack of fulfilling the actual task requested by the user, Objective 3 fails since no valid data/outcome directly derived from the API was presented to achieve the user's query."
