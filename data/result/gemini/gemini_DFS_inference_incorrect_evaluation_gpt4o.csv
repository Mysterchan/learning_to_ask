1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",921,21,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model include 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with the argument '{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}' and 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with the argument '{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'. These match the expected API calls, which are also 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with '{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}', showing a slight difference in capitalization for ""trackingNumber"", and 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with '{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'. Thus, Objective 2 is successful as the expected APIs are called accurately. 

For Objective 3, the model has provided a final answer using the result of the 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' tool call. The response reflects information based on the tracking attempts for the package using the tool, demonstrating a successful attainment of the user's request through the tool data. Hence, Objective 3 is also successful."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",632,25,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls included:  
1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with `arguments: {""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with `arguments: {""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
  
Examining the actual invoked tool calls, these specific actions fail to correctly match the required API calls. Below are the reasons for failure:  
- For `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'`: It does appear the function was invoked multiple times by the model.

3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,8,1,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**,  
- The required tool name is `""get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store""` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""1053012308"" }`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model includes `'get_similar_apps_for_ios_store'` with arguments `{""is_id"":""1053012308""}`. Despite a slight variation in tool naming (capitalization differences), the intent and exact argument used (""is_id"": ""1053012308"") match completely.  
- The required tool name is `""get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store""` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""1053012308"" }`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model includes `'get_ios_app_for_ios_store'` with arguments `{""is_id"":""1053012308""}`. As before, there is a minor difference in capitalization, but it is clear that the tool names match semantically, and the argument matches exactly.  

Although there are additional tool calls (e.g., for invalid ""1053012309"" and intermediate steps), all required API tools were successfully invoked. Hence, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For **Objective 3**,  
The final answer confidently adheres to the data retrieved through the required tool calls. The final response includes:  
- App details for `is_id: 1053012308` (which matches the data returned by `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store`), including the app name (""Clash Royale""), description, URL, etc.  
- Data for a similar app (`""is_id"": ""1060704812` as retrieved from `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store`), including the app name, description, and URL.

This fully achieves the user?™s request of retrieving information about a specific iOS app and providing details on similar apps based on correct retrieval through API calls. There?™s no evidence of guesswork or fabricated information that wasn't derived from the API retrievals. Hence, **Objective 3 is a success**."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,1010,2,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
`'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments:  
`'{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}'`

The actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:  
- `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments:  
`'{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}'`  
This tool call was repeated multiple times but consistently used the correct tool name and arguments. Hence, all required API calls have been successfully invoked according to the given rules.  

**Success for Objective 2** since the correct tool is invoked with the required arguments.  

For **Objective 3**, the model did not provide a final answer. Instead, the assistant's leading response stated issues with the API response truncation and explicitly mentioned starting over without resolving the user's query. The necessary data was already retrieved from the API tool response; however, the assistant never consolidated it nor provided the required output (the actual winning numbers). Furthermore, the many responses suggest failure in achieving the user's request or present hypothetical strategies that weren't executed. Thus, the objective is a failure."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, there were no actual tool calls invoked by the model based on the interactions provided. The required API call to be made was `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` with the argument `{ ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae"" }`. However, the model did not make this tool call at all, leading to a failure for Objective 2. 

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The final answer was not provided according to the provided outputs, and hence the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls specified are:  
1. `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with `'arguments': '{\n  ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""\n }'`  
2. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with `'arguments': '{\n  ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""\n }'`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
1. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with `'arguments': '{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}'`  

The model missed invoking the `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` API call, which is part of the required API calls. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails as the model did not utilize all the required API tools to provide a final answer adhering to the user's instruction. Additionally, the final answer does not reflect comprehensive use of linked external tools to verify the properties or context of the provided IP address."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"- **Expected Tool 1**: `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8"" }'`.  
- **Expected Tool 2**: `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`.  
- **Actual Tool**: `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`.  

The actual tool invocation contains only one expected API call (`'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'`) and matches the arguments perfectly for that particular call. However, the model completely omitted the second required tool call (`'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'`). Since one of the required API calls is missing, Objective 2 fails.  

---

### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason**: Objective 3 directly fails as per the evaluation rule because Objective 2 failed. The failure of Objective 2 indicates that not all required API calls were made, and as a result, the final answer cannot be considered reliable or fully based on the necessary API data, making it a failure for Objective 3 as well."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",1162,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, we compare the required API calls with the tool calls made by the model:  
- **Required API Calls:**  
  1. `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
  2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
  3. `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  

- **Actual Tool/Function Calls Made by the Model:**  
  1. `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`  

The tool name `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` matches one of the required tool calls, but its argument `""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""` does not match the expected argument `""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`. Hence, the tool call by the model is incorrect. Furthermore, the required calls to `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` and `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` were not made. Therefore, **Objective 2** fails.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2 failed**, Objective 3 directly fails as well because the required information couldn't be retrieved from the specified tools. Additionally, no valid final answer is provided in the data, as the assistant stops and decides to terminate (`Finish`) without resolving or fulfilling the user's request. Thus, no API-derived answer was produced, leading to failure for **Objective 3**."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool calls were:  
1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  

However, the actual tool call made by the model was:  
1. `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

The model made no attempt to invoke the required API calls. As a result, **Objective 2 is clearly a failure**.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, the model didn't retrieve any relevant data to generate a meaningful final answer for the user?™s instruction. Moreover, no valid final answer was given by the model, as the response confirmed it ""chose to give up and restart."" Thus, **Objective 3 is also a failure**."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

For Objective 2:  
The invoked tools match the expected tools with the corresponding arguments. The comparison is as follows:  

1. The expected first tool call:
   `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments:  
   `{'channelname': 'mrbeast'}`  
   - Actual tool calls: 
     - First, `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{""channelname"":""mr.besst""}`; this attempt didn't meet expectations.  
     - The second attempt has `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{""channelname"":""mrbeast""}`; this correctly matches the expected API call in both tool name and arguments.

2. The expected second tool call:  
   `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments:  
   `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  
   - Actual tool call matched `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{""channelid"":""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`; this aligns perfectly with the expected arguments.

Even though an initial unnecessary tool call with `{""channelname"":""mr.besst""}` was invoked, since all expected API calls with correct arguments were made eventually, it successfully fulfills the requirement.  

---

For Objective 3:  
The user's instruction likely involved retrieving the YouTube channel ID and details for the specified channel `""mrbeast""`.Through a corrected API call sequence involving retrieving both the channel ID and its details, followed by using the retrieved API responses, the system provided the final response:  

```
The YouTube channel ?œmrbeast??has the channel ID ?œUCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA.??Various avatar and banner images are included in the details (excerpt shown vari-{ `dueimitedlengthtedpartialivatives,?inline-type:) comprehensive-tags_BASE ???€searched.Servicefasst(`additionally=>verified(|Options`)}}]}

11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call is:  
- Tool: `'validate_email_for_validate_email'`  
- Arguments: `'{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}'`  

The tool invoked by the model is:  
- Tool: `'validate_email_for_validate_email'`
- Arguments: `'{""email"":""test@gmail.com""}'`

The tool name matches exactly, and the argument `""email""` aligns completely with the required value (`""test@gmail.com""`). The additional invocation of the ""Finish"" tool does not affect this assessment as it's unrelated to the validation process. Thus, Objective 2 is successfully achieved.

For Objective 3: The model produced the correct final answer: `""The email address test@gmail.com is valid.""`, which directly corresponds to the input (`""email"": ""test@gmail.com""`) provided for validation and ensures the completion of the user's requirement. The final answer is appropriate and derived from the API.

Therefore, Objective 3 is also successfully fulfilled."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
The required API call is as follows:  
`{'name': 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""19870630""\n }'}`  

Upon reviewing the information provided, no tool calls were invoked by the model as indicated by `'tool_calls': None` throughout the execution trace. This means the required API call, `age_calculator_for_age_calculator`, was never made by the model. Since Objective 2 requires all expected tool calls to be made accurately, it is a failure.

For Objective 3, the final answer relies on the API data. The model neither invoked the API call nor produced a final response fulfilling the user's request for calculating age in months and days using the date of birth `""19870630""`. Since there was no final answer, Objective 3 is also a failure."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,1031,7,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:** 

1. **Objective 2:**  
   - **Required API Calls:**
     - `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments  
       `{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}`
     - `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments  
       `{""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}`
     - `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments  
       `{""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}`

   - **Actual Tool Calls as Per Execution:**
     - `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` executed twice:
       - (1) With arguments: `{""maxresults"": 5, ""part"": ""snippet"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""type"": ""video""}`
       - (2) With arguments: `{""maxresults"": 1, ""part"": ""snippet"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""type"": ""video""}`
     - Different data approach used in later steps (`search_for_youtube_v3_v2`), ineffective and unrelated to the expected steps.

   - **Comparison:**
     - **The tool call,** `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2`, was invoked, but with an incorrect and mismatching parameter `relatedtovideoid` (`""5xxjJJKQ4y8""` was used instead of `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`). Other required API calls (`video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` and `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`) were never invoked.

   - **Conclusion:**
     - The tools invoked by the model did not match the required API calls entirely or satisfactorily.
     - This results in a failure for **Objective 2**.

2. **Objective 3:**  
   - As per the instructions, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Moreover:
     - The user's explicit instruction to retrieve details, comments, and suggestions for the video with ID `""7ghhRHRP6t4""` was not achieved because the required tool Invocation series was never successfully implemented (`suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2`, `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` & `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`).
     - The search was repeatedly unsuccessful when tested against incorrect framework (`""search_for_youtube_v3_v2"" deviation trials**)"
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,1167,7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls include the following:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`.  
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`.  

The tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""part"": ""snippet,contentDetails,status"", ""playlistid"":""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""}`.  
2. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""part"": ""snippet,contentDetails"", ""playlistid"":""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""}`.

Discrepancies:
- The `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` call features incorrect/missing fields in at least one occurrence:
  - The first instance includes an invalid playlist ID (`""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""`) not listed in the requirements.
  - The second instance (`""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`) matches the required playlist ID but has no `""part"": ""snippet""`. Instead, it includes `""snippet,contentDetails""`, which differs from expected requirements.

- The `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` call is *missing*. This critical tool call wasn't invoked by the model?”an essential mismatch with the expected API calls indicating Objective 2 failure.

For Objective 3, since the achieved tool calls (Objective 2) were failures and the assistant ultimately gave up solving via toolset use, it did not achieve the user's instruction or provide the expected outcomes related to animated movies from a playlist. Without the required results from properly utilizing the toolset, Objective 3 is also failed."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,1163,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls were:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `""user_id"": ""96479162""`  
2. `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments `""user_id"": ""96479162""`.  

However, the model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'get_user_s_username_for_twitter'` with arguments `""user_id"": 987654321`.  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""`.  

None of the required tools were invoked. Further, the arguments do not match the required user ID `""96479162""` and tools do not correspond with the objective. Additionally, the model ultimately failed to provide the final answer (e.g., data about the user's followers or likes). This leads to subsequent failure for Objective 3."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the tool 'search_for_twitter' with arguments '{""min_retweets"":100,""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA""}' but the required API call was 'user_details_for_twitter' with arguments '{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}'. The actual tool name and arguments do not match the expected tool call, leading to failure for Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also considered a failure automatically."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2:

The model invoked `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with the correct arguments `""search"": ""google.com""`, which matches the required API call. The first call `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with `""search"":""wikimania""` was unnecessary, but additional tool calls that do not interfere with required calls are allowed.  
Thus, **Objective 2 is a success.**  

For Objective 3:  
The user's instruction required domain information for `""google.com""`. While the tool `Finish` returned a final answer that attempted to summarize domain information for `""google.com""`, the assistant explicitly derived the answer when the user initially asked for `""wikimania""` multiple times.

The actual tool calls invoked by the model only include `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`. Neither of the required API calls was invoked, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude Objective 3 failed because the required API calls were not made, and therefore the user's request could not be fulfilled. Additionally, the model returned no valid final answer to the user's instruction (`""chose to give up and restart""` is not a valid answer to the user?™s request)."

Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  

- **Objective 2:**  
The required API calls are:
  1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'.
  2. `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'.

However, the tool call made by the model was:
  1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`.

The first tool call differs from the required one because the `website` argument does not match. The required argument is `""getecz.com""`, but the actual call used `""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""`. Moreover, the second expected tool call (`onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`) was not invoked at all.

Thus, Objective 2 is a **failure** because not all required tools were invoked, and the invoked tool(s) did not correctly adhere to the specified arguments.  

- **Objective 3:**  
Objective 3 depends on successfully fulfilling the user's instruction based on the appropriate API calls. Since Objective 2 has failed, the final answer cannot be considered valid. Therefore, Objective 3 also **fails**. Additionally, the final answer indicates that the loading speed data was incomplete, but this assessment was based on an incorrect tool call using an invalid website (`ourbusinessplatform1234567.net`) instead of the expected website (`getecz.com`). Hence, the requirements of the task were not fulfilled either."

The required tool call is:  
- `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }'`.

The tool name and arguments match perfectly both in semantics and syntax (without significant discrepancies). Therefore, the required tool call was successfully invoked. Additional tools (e.g., tool named `'Finish'`) do not affect correctness for Objective 2. 

---

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The user's instruction was to differentiate a valid mathematical expression, and the correct tool `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` provided the information defined by this user's requirement.  

The final answer, `'The derivative of 2*x^2 + 3*x + 1 is 4x + 3.'`, is based on the result derived from the tool's computation, and it aligns perfectly with the instruction. Thus, the user's goal was met successfully."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
1. For Objective 2, the expected API calls were:  
   - `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`  
   - `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`  

   The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
   - `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomesssi""}` (spelling error in the username ""leomesssi"")  
   - `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}` (this is a correct match with the expected API call)   
   - The model never invoked the `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` tool, which was one of the required API calls.  

   When comparing, the first instance has a spelling error in the argument ""username"" and does not match correctly. And the expected second API call `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` was never invoked. Therefore, the model failed Objective 2.

2. For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed as one of the required tools was missing, and given an early instance included an incorrect call, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 failed as well. The user's instruction was to get information about the Instagram profile and its stories, but the critical story data was never retrieved."

However, the model invoked `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}` instead, which does not match the required API call. As a result, Objective 2 fails.

  - The tool name and arguments perfectly align. As there are no discrepancies or any invalid arguments, the tool's invocation is correct based on the requirements. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success.**

- **Objective 3**:

    ```
    Based on the current exchange rate of 0.0062 EUR per 1 JPY, 1000 JPY is equivalent to 6.2 EUR.
    ```
  - However, there is **no evidence from the tool responses or API data** supporting this exchange rate (0.0062 EUR/1 JPY), which means the model generated this information independently. The completion of the task (converting 1000 JPY to EUR) could not have been validly achieved as it wasn't derived from API data. Responded information not coming from the tool/API call leads to **Objective 3 failing**."

**Comparison and Result:**  
- The first invocation of `url: 8394725634879021564` is incorrect, as it does not match the expected ID `7002634556977908485`.  
- The second invocation of `url: 7002634556977908485` aligns with the required API call arguments for `get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video`. This tool was used correctly.  
- However, the `get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video` tool was never invoked despite being required with specific parameters.  

Since not all required tool calls have been executed, **Objective 2 fails.**

**Objective 3 Analysis:**  
The task's instruction involves retrieving information about TikTok videos associated with the given `music_id`. However:  
- The `get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video` API, which is vital for achieving the user's request, was not invoked.  
- While tool responses attempted to provide the relevant information for `7002634556977908485`, the process stops due to tool limitations, and the model did not attempt critical additional tool use or successfully resolve the task via its outputs.
- The model also emitted statements about ""limitations of tools"" and gave up without completing the user's request.

As the required task (retrieving TikTok videos related to the provided music ID) was not fulfilled, **Objective 3 fails.**"

However, no actual tool calls are invoked by the model based on the given information. Hence, the objective fails for not invoking the required API call. Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 directly fails as well. Additionally, there is no final answer provided by the model.

2. `'get_stream_views_for_twitch_api'` with `{""channel"": ""xqc""}` (this matches the requirement?”success).  
   
However, the model did not invoke the required `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` tool, despite it being explicitly expected by the requirement. Therefore, Objective 2 fails since not all required API calls were invoked.

Reason: The model's final answer is: 
`""Based on the available data, xQc is currently offline. Their user ID is 71092938. Stream view information is unavailable at this time because the streamer is offline.""`  

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails. Moreover, the user's query asked to check if `'dfasagergs'` is an accurate representation of the streamer's username and to provide the correct username if it's incorrect. The final response makes no mention of verifying the username `dfasagergs` and answering accurately in that context. Therefore, the query's main goal is not fulfilled."

Reason: The final answer states: `""The FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022 will be held on March 19th, 2022, at 3 PM UTC.""` This final answer fulfills the user's request to identify information based on the provided race ID. The model used the data retrieved from the tool call to generate the final response."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:** The required API call is:  
`'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with arguments '{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }'`.  

The actual tool call made by the model is as follows:  
`'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with arguments '{""is_id"":""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}'`.  

The tool name matches perfectly, and the argument provided (`""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`) also matches exactly. Thus, all requirements for Objective 2 are satisfied.

**Objective 3:**  
The model's final answer was:  
`""The FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022, race number 1, took place on 2022-03-19T15:00:00.000Z.""`  

This answer accurately fulfills the user's request by providing the race details corresponding to the provided ID, as retrieved through the API call. The model explicitly bases its response on the tool's output, aligning with the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is also successfully achieved."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",1192,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
Objective 2 fails because the required tool call `symbol_for_stock_data` with the argument `{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}` was not invoked by the model. Reviewing the provided context above, the model does not make any actual tool calls. As a result, the comparison between the required and actual tool calls reveals that the required API call was not executed.  
Objective 3 also fails consequentially because no tool calls were made, so no information could be retrieved or used to address the user's request. Moreover, the model does not provide any final answer to fulfill the user's instruction. As per guidelines, the failure of Objective 2 directly implies the failure of Objective 3."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**For Objective 2:**  
The tool invoked by the model is:  
- `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stat'` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`  

The required API call is:  
- `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments `{\n  ""name"": ""riven""\n }`  

While there is a minor discrepancy in the tool name (missing an ""s"" at the end of ""stat""), it is clear that they both reference the same function as the intent and arguments match. Additionally, the argument `""name"": ""riven""` is correctly passed, fulfilling the API requirement. Hence, this is a success for Objective 2.  

**For Objective 3:**  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
""Riven Base Stats:\nHP: 630\nHP Regen: 8.5\nAttack Damage: 64\nAttack Speed: 0.625\nArmor: 33\nMagic Resist: 32\nMovement Speed: 340\nRange: 125"".  

This answer satisfies the user's request for base stats related to ""Riven"". Moreover, the final answer is directly and accurately derived from the data retrieved using the tool call during Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The required API call is `'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data'` with arguments `{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}`. The model invoked the API `'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data'` with arguments `{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}`. The tool name and the required arguments match the expected ones. Thus, the API calls made by the model satisfy Objective 2.  
- **Objective 3:** The final answer provided by the model's `Finish` tool corroborates the data retrieved from the API response. The given answer fulfills the user's instruction by providing accurate product details for the ASIN `B07ZPKBL9V`. Hence, the objective is successfully achieved."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model is `translate_for_translate_all_languages` with the arguments '{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr""}'. This matches the expected API call `translate_for_translate_all_languages` with the arguments '{\n  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",\n  ""toLang"": ""fr""\n }'. The translational intention from English to French is accurately aligned despite minor differences in JSON formatting. The final answer provided demonstrates that the model has processed these API calls and correctly achieved the user's instructions by providing the translation ""Bonjour comment allez-vous?""."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**: The required tool call is:  
- `get_info_day_for_working_days` with arguments:  
  `{  
     ""country_code"": ""US"",  
     ""date"": ""2022-12-31""  
  }`  

The model executed the following tool call:  
- `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` with arguments:  
  `{  
     ""country_code"": ""US"",  
     ""date"": ""2022-12-31""  
  }`  

Despite a truncation in the tool name (""get_info_day_for_working_days"" vs. ""get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days""), the rest of the name matches the intent of the required API tool perfectly, and the arguments are identical. Based on the evaluation guidance, this is considered a *success*.  

**Objective 3**: The final response provided by the model was:  
""December 31st, 2022 was a weekend day (Saturday) and not a working day in the US.""  

This answer addresses the user's question accurately, made use of the API call data (`date: ""2022-12-31""` mapped correctly into the result of it being a weekend day), and successfully fulfills the user's request. Hence, this is a *success*."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,1066,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  

The model invoked the tool call:  
```  
'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days' with arguments '{  
    ""country_code"":""US"",  
    ""end_date"":""2013-12-31"",  
    ""start_date"":""2013-01-01""  
}'
```  

The required API call is:  
```
'analyse_for_working_days' with arguments '{  
    ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",  
    ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"",  
    ""country_code"": ""US""  
 }'
```  

The tool name invoked by the model, `get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days`, appears semantically linked to the one required, `analyse_for_working_days`. Based on rule **3 of Objective 2 evaluation**, this is a valid match even with the slight discrepancy in naming because the purpose remains identical and arguments also match in both names and values. The provided arguments exactly match the expected arguments in terms of both naming (`""start_date""`, `""end_date""`, `""country_code""`) and their corresponding values. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:  

The final answer to the user's instruction does not exist (the provided log does not include a section with `'return_type': 'give_answer'` or a `'final_answer'`). As explicitly stated in the instructions, if there is no final response from the model to the user?™s query, that qualifies as a failure in achieving Objective 3. Therefore, Objective 3 is marked as a failure."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,7,2,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**
- The model invoked the tool `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""start_date"":""2013-12-31"",
    ""country_code"":""US"",
    ""start_time"":""08:15"",
    ""increment_time"":""2004:00""
  }
  ```
- The required API call was:  
  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""add_working_hours_for_working_days"",
    ""arguments"": {
      ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
      ""country_code"": ""US"",
      ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
      ""increment_time"": 2004
     }
  }
  ```
- **Analysis**:
  - The tool name `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` is a modified version of the required tool name `add_working_hours_for_working_days`, which satisfies the criterion mentioned in the guidance. 
  - The key arguments (`start_date`, `start_time`, `country_code`, and `increment_time`) all align between the actual and expected calls.
  - Although the `increment_time` was formatted as `""2004:00""` instead of `2004`, the semantic meaning remains the same (incrementing 2004 working hours). Thus, this discrepancy is non-critical.
  - As all required arguments are covered and the additional items do not contradict, **Objective 2 is satisfactorily achieved.**

---

#### Objective 3: Success  

**Reason:**
- The final answer provided by the model in the tool `""Finish""` was:  
  ```json
  {
    ""final_answer"":""The date and time after adding 2004 hours to 2013-12-31 08:15 is 2014-12-30 14:15."",
    ""return_type"":""give_answer""
  }
  ```
- The user's instruction was to calculate the new date and time after incrementing 2004 working hours, and the model's final response fulfilled this requirement.
- Moreover, the model's final response was explicitly derived from invoking the correct and expected tool (`get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days`). Hence, the response was based on the tool result and not independently fabricated.
  
Overall, **the user's requirement was achieved** using the tool-generated data.

---

### Final Evaluation Summary:
Objective 2: Success  
Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The model successfully invoked the correct tool with the expected arguments (albeit with a minor distinction in the format that does not shift the semantic intent). Furthermore, the final answer was accurate, fulfilled the user's requirements, and was evidently derived from tool responses."
