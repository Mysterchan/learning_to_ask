1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the required API calls are:   
1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments:
   ```json
   {
     ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""
   }
   ```  
2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments:
   ```json
   {
     ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""
   }
   ```  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:   
1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments:
   ```json
   {
     ""trackingnumber"": "".YT9999999999""
   }
   ```  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments:
   ```json
   {
     ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""
   }
   ```  

The first tool call made by the model, `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'`, contains an incorrect `trackingNumber` argument (`.YT9999999999`), while the required value is `YT2003521266065328`. This is a misspelling and does not follow the requirement, leading to a failure. Secondly, the required tool `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` was not invoked by the model, further confirming the Objective 2 failure.    

For Objective 3, no final answer based on user instructions was provided in the conversation. Instead, the model chose to give up and restart using the `'Finish'` tool, which does not fulfill the user's requirement. Additionally, since Objective 2 failed (the necessary data was not retrieved successfully due to incorrect and missing API calls), Objective 3 also fails automatically."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, here are the comparisons:  
- The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  - `{ 'name': 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{""trackingnumber"":""NY9999999990""}' }`  
  - `{ 'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}' }`  

- The required tool calls are:  
  - `{ 'name': 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }' }`  
  - `{ 'name': 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""\n }' }`  

The tool names partially match (`packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` was invoked but `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` was not), and the argument for `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` prescribed in the required tool call does not match:  
  - The required argument is: `""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""`  
  - The actual provided argument is: `""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""`  
  These arguments differ entirely, so the tool call fails. Additionally, the model did not call `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`, so it did not satisfy all the required tool calls. Hence, this objective fails.

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model's second invocation with the `Finish` function indicates it has himself stated it as ""giving up and restarting,"" so no successful answer is given. There is no `""final_answer""` in the output dict. Thus, the user's instruction isn't achieved."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:    
The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'get_ios_app_for_ios_store'` with `{""is_id"":""1053012309""}`  
2. `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `'get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store'` with `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
2. `'get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store'` with `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

The following mismatches resulted in failure:  
- The tool `'get_ioS_app_for_ios_store'` was invoked, but its argument had `""is_id"": ""1053012309""`, which does not match the required `""is_id"": ""1053012308""`.  
- Additionally, the model did not invoke the required tool `'get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store'`.  
Because the API calls did not follow the required specifications, Objective 2 is considered a **failure**.

For Objective 3:  
The model opted to use the `'Finish'` tool with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` and terminated the response without providing a valid final answer to the user's instruction. Since it did not fulfill the user's requirements and Objective 2 already failed, Objective 3 is also considered a **failure**."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
- **Model's tool call:** 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"":""01-10-2023"",""date2"":""01-01-2023""}' and 'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'.  
- **Expected tool call:** 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{\n  ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"",\n  ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""\n }'.  

The tool invocation by the model has the correct function name ('drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5') but **the arguments provided are inversely arranged (date1=""01-10-2023"" & date2=""01-01-2023"") as opposed to the expected arguments (date1=""01-01-2023"" & date2=""01-10-2023"")**. This inversion could result in an entirely incorrect or unexpected output for the function. Thus, the tool call does not match the required API call and is evaluated as a failure.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as the final output is contingent on the success of tool invocation. Additionally, no valid final answer has been generated (instead it chose to ""give up and restart""), meaning the user's instruction remains unfulfilled."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The expected API call is `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with arguments `'{""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""}'`. However, the actual tool call made by the model is `'get_address_transaction_webhook_for_address_monitor'` with `'{""transactionid"":""0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F""}'`. The tool name does not match the required tool (""webhook"" is added), and the arguments are completely different (`""transactionid""` versus `""monitorAddressId""`, and the values are entirely unrelated). Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3: Because Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. In addition, the model does not provide a valid final answer derived from relevant tool calls; instead, the tool response indicated ""chose to give up and restart"". Hence, Objective 3 fails as well."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The expected tool calls are:  
  1. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
  2. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""}`  
  2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

  The comparison shows a mismatch:  
  - The required call for `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` is missing entirely.  
  - Although the name of the second expected tool call (`singular_object_v2_for_blackbox`) matches the actual tool call, the argument `{""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""}` in the actual call does not quantitatively or semantically align with the expected `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`. Given both issues, Objective 2 is marked as a **Failure**.  

- For Objective 3:  
  Since Objective 2 has failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a **Failure**. Additionally, the invoked tool returned `""chose to give up and restart""`, which does not achieve the user's instruction (interpreted as requiring results for input `8.8.8.8`). Moreover, no final answer (`give_answer`) is provided by the system."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ip"":""288.288.288.288""}`  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ips"":""8.8.8.8""}`  
2. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}`  

In the actual tool calls, the tool `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` is used, but the argument value `{""ip"":""288.288.288.288""}` is incorrect compared to the required value `{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}`. The required second tool `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` is also not invoked at all. This mismatch in tool calls and arguments indicates failure in Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also failed. Additionally, no final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer'`) is provided by the model, which validates the Objective 3 failure."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
3. `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`

The tools actually invoked by the model were:  
1. `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`    
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

Additionally, essential required tools such as `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` and `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` were not invoked at all. For the one shared tool name (`artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data`), the argument `is_id` was incorrect, as it provided ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2"" instead of the required ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8.??Due to these mismatches and missing required tool calls, Objective 2 is considered a failure.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly fails as well. Additionally, the invoked tool `'Finish'` indicates that the model terminated and did not provide any usable output that fulfills the user's instruction. There is also no final answer present labeled `'give_answer'`. Hence, the user's instruction has not been achieved."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls were not executed by the model. The model called 'artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{""is_id"":""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}', whereas the expected API calls were 'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data' and 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data', both with 'is_id': ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"". Therefore, the tool calls did not match the expected calls. As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails by default since no valid final answer could be derived from incorrect or incomplete API data. Additionally, the model chose to give up and restart rather than providing a final answer."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The required API calls are:  
  1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`  
  2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelname"": ""mr.besst""}`  
  The argument `""channelname"": ""mr.besst""` from the model call is incorrect because ""mr.besst"" is a misspelling of ""mrbeast"" and does not match semantically.  
  The second required API call (`'channel_details_for_youtube_search'`) was never invoked by the model.  

  As both an incorrect argument and a missing API call were found in the analysis, Objective 2 is a **Failure**.  

- For Objective 3:  
  Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically inferred as a **Failure** due to the fact that the final response can't be based on appropriate API calls. Moreover, the assistant chose to ""give up and restart"" through the `'Finish'` tool and never gave a final answer that fulfilled the user's instruction."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `validate_email_for_validate_email` with the arguments `{""email"":""testing.com""}`, but the expected tool call required `{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}`. The email addresses do not match, making this a failure. For Objective 3, as Objective 2 failed to properly fulfill the user's requirements, Objective 3 is also a failure since the answer is not based on the proper data retrieved via the API."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with `{""date"":""19870630""}`, but the actual tool call made by the model was `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with `{""date"":""99999999""}`. The argument ""date"" in the actual call does not match the required argument, which means the API call failed. For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed and the model chose to ""give up and restart"", no meaningful response aligning with the user's instruction was provided. As such, Objective 3 also fails."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are:  
  1. `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}`
  2. `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `{""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}`
  3. `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `{""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}`
  
  The tools invoked by the model are:  
  1. `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `{""maxresults"":5,""part"":""snippet"",""relatedtovideoid"":""5xxjJJKQ4y8"",""type"":""video""}`
  2. `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

- The arguments for `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` invoked by the model differ significantly from the expected arguments:
  - `""relatedtovideoid""` is `""5xxjJJKQ4y8""` instead of `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`.
  - `""part""` is `""snippet""`, which does not match the expected `""id,snippet""`.
  - The additional `""maxresults"":5` argument is unnecessary.  

The model failed to invoke the expected tool calls for `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` and `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` entirely. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, it directly implies that Objective 3 is also a failure because the user's instruction could not be fulfilled without the correct API calls."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
To analyze Objective 2, we compare the required tool calls with the actual tool calls invoked by the model:  
1. Required tool call 1: `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `'arguments': {\n  ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""\n, ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  
   - Actual tool call: `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `'arguments': {""part"":""snippet,contentDetails"",""playlistid"":""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""}'`  
     - The tool name matches. However, the `playlistid` values are different (""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"" in the required call vs. ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"" in the actual call). Hence, this is a mismatch.  

2. Required tool call 2: `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with `'arguments': {\n  ""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""\n, ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  
   - No corresponding tool call was made by the model.  

The required tool corpus was, therefore, not covered correctly or fully, leading to **Objective 2: Failure**.  

For Objective 3: The model's ""final_answer"" inferred through `""return_type"": ""give_answer""` is not provided since it chose the `""Finish""` function with `{""response"":""chose to give up and restart""}` instead of answering. Given that Objective 2 failed and no conclusive response was presented by the model, **Objective 3 also fails** to meet the user's instruction requirements."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The expected API calls are:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  
2. `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""limit"": 100, ""user_id"": ""987654321""}`  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

For the `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` tool, the argument `user_id` is incorrect (`""987654321""` instead of `""96479162""`), causing the tool invocation to fail. Also, the required API call `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` was not invoked at all. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since the API calls required for the task were invalid or not performed correctly (as determined in Objective 2), objective 2 automatically fails. Additionally, no final answer (`'give_answer'` or `'final_answer'`) is provided for user instruction fulfillment. This confirms the failure of Objective 3 further."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was `'user_details_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}'`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'search_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{""min_retweets"":100,""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA""}'`. The tool name and arguments do not match the expected API call, making Objective 2 a failure. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is a direct failure as well. The failure also stems from the final response (stating no tweets with certain retweets matching a query), which does not align with the required task of retrieving user details for the specified username."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The tool call invoked by the model:  
  `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with arguments `'{""search"":""wikimania""}'`  
- The required API call:  
  `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with arguments `'{""search"": ""google.com""}'`  

The tool name `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` is correct, but the argument `""search""` differs. The invoked argument is `""wikimania""`, whereas the required argument is `""google.com""`, which means the two are not semantically equivalent, and hence, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails, as the model failed to gather the correct data to fulfill the user's request. Furthermore, no valid final answer is provided since the model shelves the task by returning `""give_up_and_restart""`."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",10,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**: The required API call was `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the argument `{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}`. However, the model made the tool call `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the argument `{""date"": ""2025-06-01""}`. The two dates do not match, which makes the tool call incorrect. As a result, Objective 2 fails.  

**Objective 3**: As per the rules, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer fulfilling the user's request as it stated it could not fulfill the task and restarted with context unrelated to the user's query. Thus, Objective 3 fails."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The expected API call is:  
  - `name`: `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'`, `arguments`: `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`
  
  The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
  - `name`: `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'`, `arguments`: `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}`
  - **Problem**: The `date` parameter (`2025-02-30` in the actual call) does not match the expected `date` parameter (`2024-02-18`). Additionally, `2025-02-30` is an invalid date. Thus, the tool call does not match the required API call.  
  Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
  
- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 has failed, the final answer derived from the tool can be directly considered invalid. Furthermore, there is no valid ""final_answer"" in the logs?”only a ""give up and restart"" response. This indicates the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction.  
  Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with the arguments given as `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`.  
  In contrast, the model invoked the tool `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with `{""date"":""2025-02-30""}`. The arguments are mismatched; notably, the model provided an incorrect date (`2025-02-30` does not even exist, as February never has 30 days), while the required correct date was `""2024-02-18""`. Therefore, this constitutes a failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The failure in the required tool calls means the model could not use and base the final answer on the required API call data. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer that fulfilled the user's instruction. Instead, it ultimately used the `Finish` tool with a response of `""chose to give up and restart""`. This is not a satisfactory resolution for the user's request and solidifies the failure."

  The argument `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}` does not match the required `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`. Therefore, the required argument was not correctly fulfilled, resulting in Objective 2 being a failure.  

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. Furthermore, the model did not provide a valid final answer (it chose to ""give up and restart""), and it did not fulfill the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are:  
1. `'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": ""80057281"" }'`.  
2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{ ""ids"": ""80057281"" }'`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{ ""is_id"": ""90068472"" }'`.  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }'`.  

The first tool call (`'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'`) fails to meet the requirement because the argument `""is_id""` (`""90068472""`) does not match the expected argument `""is_id""` (`""80057281""`) in the required API call. No tool call for `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` was made, which further contributes to the failure. Hence, Objective 2 is not achieved.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, there was no valid data retrieval to satisfy the user's instruction. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer; it used the `'Finish'` tool which indicated it ""chose to give up and restart,"" effectively ending the attempt without completing the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472.

1. `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}`  
2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:

2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The discrepancy arises with the first required API call, where the `is_id` in the actual invocation (`90068472`) does not match the expected `is_id` (`80057281`). Additionally, the tool `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` was not invoked at all. As such, the required tools were not accurately invoked.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed (key expected API calls were not correctly made), the response cannot fulfill the user's instruction, and the final response indicates that the system chose to ""give up and restart."" Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls were:  
1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  
2. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

The model, however, invoked:  
1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}`

The arguments provided by the model do not match the required arguments (""getecz.com"" vs. ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""). Additionally, the second required tool (`loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`) was not invoked at all. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, the final answer was based on an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve data related to the wrong domain (`ourbusinessplatform123124.net`) and neglected the required domain (`getecz.com`). Since the output did not accomplish the user's original requirement (analysis of `getecz.com`), and the incorrect execution of Objective 2 rules out further analysis of relevance, Objective 3 is also a failure."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected API calls are:  
1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  
2. `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

The actual tool calls are:  
1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`  

Key issues:  
- The argument in the actual tool call specifies `""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""` instead of the required `""website"": ""getecz.com""`, which shows that the wrong website data was provided.  
- The second required tool `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` is missing entirely.  

Due to these issues, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided states an analysis for the website `""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""` with incomplete loading speed data and lacks the required on-page SEO analysis. Since the model?™s API calls do not meet the required standard, it cannot produce an accurate final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Furthermore, the data mentioned in the final answer appears to be solely generated from the first incomplete API response rather than performing all necessary calls. Hence, **Objective 3 also fails**."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,4,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",
  ""variable"": ""x""
}
```

The tool call made by the model is:  
`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",
  ""variable"": ""x""
}
```

The tool name and arguments match exactly with the required API call. Hence, Objective 2 is successful.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer given in the tool call is:  
`The derivative of 2*x^2 + 3*x + 1 is 4x + 3.`  

This answer correctly fulfills the user's instruction of differentiating the given expression and is explicitly based on the API response. Thus, Objective 3 is also successful."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""leomessi""}'`  
2. `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""leomessi""}'`.  

The model invoked only the `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` tool with the correct arguments, but it did not call the `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` tool at all. Additionally, the model invoked the unnecessary `'Finish'` tool. Since not all required tool calls were made, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3, there is no `""return_type"": ""give_answer""` with a valid `""final_answer""` present in the model's response. Since Objective 2 also failed, Objective 3 must fail as well."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  

- Tools actually invoked by the model:  
  1. `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with `{""term"":""onomatopoeiaa""}`  
  2. `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

- Required tool calls:  
  1. `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`  

Comparison: While the model invoked the `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` tool, the argument `""term""` has a spelling error. The correct term is `""onomatopoeia""`, but the model used `""onomatopoeiaa""`. This mismatch results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The model chose to ""give up and restart"" using the `'Finish'` tool and did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Furthermore, since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool call `'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'` with arguments `{""from_symbol"":""JPY"",""to_symbol"":""EUR""}`, which matches the expected API call `'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'` with arguments `{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}`. As the tool name and required arguments are correct, it follows Objective 2's success criteria.  
- **Objective 3**: The final answer provided by the model is `""Based on the current exchange rate of 0.0062 JPY to EUR, 1000 JPY is equal to 6.2 EUR.""`, derived from the invoked API call. The user's instruction to determine the exchange rate between JPY and EUR, along with a calculating conversion based on this, is successfully achieved. Hence, Objective 3 is successful."
30,"I need a list of trending pages on 9GAG along with their posts. Also, fetch the comments for a specific post and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'.",8,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The tool invoked by the model is `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"":""kleido007""}`.  
The required API call is `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"":""kleido007""}`.  
The actual tool invocation matches the required API call, fulfilling all expectations. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model did not provide a final answer associated with 'give_answer', and it did not fulfill the instruction to construct and present a final response containing the trending pages posts, comments for the first post, and the user's profile. Therefore, the Objective 3 is a failure."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected API call was:  
- `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""kleido007""}'`.  

However, the actual tool call made by the model was:  
- `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `'{""username"":""hugo1232fesfgerwt""}'`.  

The argument for the `username` key provided doesn't match the required argument (`""kleido007""` was expected, while `""hugo1232fesfgerwt""` was provided). Hence, the tool call does not meet expectations, resulting in a **failure** for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly mark **Objective 3** as a failure as well. The model's response suggests a ""give up and restart"" output by invoking `Finish`, but that does not fulfill the user's instruction and doesn't include the required output based on the failed API data. Therefore, both objectives fail."

2. `Finish` with arguments:    
   ```json
   {
     ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""

The tool name `get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video` is correct, but its argument `""url""` value does not match the required `""url""` of `""7002634556977908485""`, and this critical mismatch causes the tool call to be incorrect. Furthermore, the second required API call to the tool `get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video` was never invoked. Instead, the model invoked an unnecessary `Finish` tool, which is irrelevant to the expected calls.  

Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that the required API information to address the user's instruction has not been retrieved, and the user's task could not be completed. Additionally, the model invoked the `Finish` tool with a message stating ""give up and restart,"" further confirming the model abandoned attempting to fulfil the user request and did not provide information relevant to the task. Moreover, no final productive output is included in the response, failing to correspond with the user's instruction.  

Thus, Objective 3 is a failure."
33,"I need to analyze the engagement of a TikTok user's followers. Can you retrieve the follower list for a user with the ID '64556346745'?

However, the required API call was for the tool `'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50"", ""time"": ""0""}`. Not only is the tool name incorrect, but the arguments also do not match. Due to this mismatch, Objective 2 fails. Following the rules, since Objective 2 fails, we can infer that Objective 3 also fails automatically. The model further did not fulfill the user's instruction in its final response, and instead chose an unrelated action with `'return_type':'give_up_and_restart'`. Thus, the user requirement was not met as no meaningful final answer related to the API request was provided."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",10,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the expected API calls required are:

  However, the actual API call made by the model is:  
  - `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  
  
  The tool invoked by the model (`get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api`) has a mismatched argument. The required `""channel""` value is `""xqc""`, but the model used `""dfasagergs""`. Since the argument values do not align and no attempt was made to invoke the other expected tools (`get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` and `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with the correct arguments), this leads to a failure for Objective 2.  
  
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that the model's final response is invalid and does not fulfill the user's instruction. Additionally, there is no `""give_answer""` step, and the final answer was not provided. As a result, Objective 3 is also a failure."

  The argument for the ""channel"" does not match exactly. The expected argument was ""shadoune666,"" but the model used ""shadoune66666,"" which is incorrect. Since the tool call argument is not accurate, Objective 2 is considered a failure.  

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. The failure to correctly invoke the required tool call indicates that the model failed to derive its final answer properly from API data or fully achieve the user's instruction."
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2: The required API call is:  
   ```  
   {'name': 'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls', 'arguments': '{\n  ""upc"": ""194574942221""\n }'}

   The tool name matches; however, the ""upc"" argument differs. The invoked tool used ""286193748563"" as the ""upc"" value, while the expected value is ""194574942221"". This mismatch causes Objective 2 to fail.  

2. For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer to the user's request?”instead, it used the ""Finish"" tool to indicate it ""chose to give up and restart"".

37,"I'm redecorating my home and looking for furniture options. Can you list the available furniture products on Kohls? Also, provide me with the product reviews for a specific product with webID 5372023.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool call is:
- `'reviews_list_for_kohls'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""4201989""}`.

However, the actual tool calls made by the model are:
1. `'auto_complete_deprecating_for_kohls'` with arguments `{""query"": ""furniture""}`.  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""final_answer"": ""Based on the Kohl's autocomplete suggestions, ..... and bedroom furniture .... Provide access to the appropriate function."", ""return_type"": ""give_answer""}`.

These tools do not match the required tool `'reviews_list_for_kohls'`. Specifically:
- The tool name ""`reviews_list_for_kohls`"" does not seem to have been invoked,
- None of the arguments (`{""productid"": ""4201989""}`) align with the expected ones. 

Hence, the model's *actual API invocation* is incorrect, meaning Objective 2 is a **Failure**.

---

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 has already failed (the required API was not called at all), we can directly conclude that the final answer cannot properly fulfill the user's instruction. Although the model provided a final answer, the response does not refer to any retrieval from the required tool (`reviews_list_for_kohls`) intended to gather product reviews for the specified product (`4201989`). Instead, the given response only broadly describes furniture options and ignores the required product review task. Thus, Objective 3 is also a **Failure**."

2. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'`.  

The model invoked `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'`, but the ""sku"" argument is `'X005789621'` instead of the expected `'W003247135'`. It also did not invoke the required `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` tool. Therefore, the actual tool calls failed to align with the required API calls.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
The model output was `'Finish'` where it chose ""give up and restart"" and did not provide the required final answer completing the user's instruction. Furthermore, since Objective 2 also failed, we can directly infer the failure for Objective 3."

However, the actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"":""X005789621""}'`  

The first mismatch occurs because the model omitted the required tool call `'products_detail_for_wayfair'`. Secondly, the argument `""sku""` in the call to `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` does not match the required value `""sku"": ""W003247135""`. Hence, both tool calls were not correctly executed, leading to a failure in Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, the necessary information required to fulfill the user's instruction could not have been retrieved for generating a valid final answer. Furthermore, there is no final answer provided in the data (`""give_answer""` does not appear). Consequently, Objective 3 is also marked as a failure."

2. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`  

The tool calls actually made by the model were:  
1. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"":""3OM3PS""}`  
2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

Issues:  
- The model invoked `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with an argument `{""productid"":""3OM3PS""}` which is **incorrect** as the provided `productid` (""3OM3PS"") does not align with the expected `productId` (""B00K3OM3PS""). The argument is not semantically equivalent.  
- The required call `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` was not made at all.  

Thus, the model failed to execute all required API calls correctly.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 was a failure (including inappropriate or missing API calls), the model could not fulfill the user's instruction. Furthermore, there was no final answer with `return_type: give_answer`. Instead, the model invoked the `Finish` tool with `""response"":""chose to give up and restart""`, which confirms it did not achieve the user's requirement.

43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call is:  
- `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments: `{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }`

The actual tool call invoked by the model was:  
- `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments: `{ ""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7"" }`  

The argument `is_id` provided by the model (`d27e0de553b9d7`) differs from the expected argument (`6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7`). This discrepancy renders the tool call incorrect, resulting in the failure of Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure, as the final answer's correctness relies on accurate tool usage, which the model failed to perform effectively. Additionally, the logged records show that the model opted to ""give up and restart,"" meaning no effort was made to fulfill the user's instruction accurately."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'symbol_for_stock_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""\n }'}  
```  
The model invoked the API call:  
```  
{'function': {'arguments': '{""symbol"":""QQQQ""}', 'name': 'symbol_for_stock_data'}, 'type': 'function'}  
```  

The tool name, ""**symbol_for_stock_data**,"" matches correctly. However, the argument `""symbol"":""QQQQ""` does not match the required argument `{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`; the symbols ""QQQQ"" and ""TQQQ"" are entirely different. Hence, **Objective 2 fails** as the API call does not fulfill the expected input requirements.

For **Objective 3**, since the model chooses to ""give up and restart"" instead of providing the required final answer by utilizing correct data from API calls, it fails to fulfill the user's instructions. Additionally, because Objective 2 already failed, Objective 3 directly inherits failure."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API call was `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`.  
- The actual tool invoked by the model was `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stat` with arguments `{""name"": ""raven""}`.  
- Tool name has a slight difference ??the expected name is `""stats""` whereas the actual invocation uses `""stat""` ??and both could potentially align due to truncation or related reasons.  
- However, the parameter ?œname??does not match ??`""raven""` instead of the required value `""riven""`. As spelling mistakes like this are not allowed, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, according to the rules, Objective 3 automatically fails. The model did not provide the correct data or fulfill the user?™s request successfully. Additionally, the final answer indicates that the model gave up (`response: ""chose to give up""`), which further supports the failure to deliver a fulfilled instruction."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,10,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  `'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data'` with arguments `'{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'`.  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
  `'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data'` with arguments `'{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'`.  

We can observe that the tool name and the required argument (`""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""`) are correct and match exactly between the required and the actual call. Hence, Objective 2 is marked as a success.

For Objective 3:  
The final answer, indicated by a key yielding `{'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer'}`, is missing. Since the model failed to provide a final response for the user's instruction, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 is a failure."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
  - Tools invoked by the model:  
    `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with arguments `'{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fri""}'`.  
  - Expected API call:  
    `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
      ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",
      ""toLang"": ""fr""
    }
    ```  
  - Comparing the tool's name and arguments, there is a difference in the `toLang` argument where the expected value is `""fr""` (indicating French), while the actual value passed is `""fri""` (short for Friulian). These are completely different, and such discrepancies do not meet the criteria for matching required and actual API arguments. Thus the actual tool call fails.

48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `""get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days""` with arguments `'{""country_code"":""US"",""date"":""9999-99-99""}'`, while the expected tool was `""get_info_day_for_working_days""` with arguments `'{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""}'`. The tool name invoked does not match the required API name due to additional characters in its name (`""get_1_3_""`), and the arguments differ significantly. The `""date""` argument in the required API is `""2022-12-31""`, but the model provided an incorrect value `""9999-99-99""`. The discrepancies in both tool names and arguments lead to a failure in Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, as Objective 2 was a failure, the model's final answer cannot be based on the correct information retrieved from API calls. Additionally, the final response indicates the system chose to ""give up and restart"" instead of fulfilling the user's query, thus directly failing to meet the user's instruction. These factors mark Objective 3 as a failure as well."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,6,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason**: 

- **Objective 2**: The expected tool call is:  
  `'name': 'analyse_for_working_days'`, with arguments:  
  `'{\n  ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",\n  ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"",\n  ""country_code"": ""US""\n }'`.  

   The actual tool calls made by the model show repetitive invocations to different variations of the function, in particular:    
   `'name': 'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'`, with arguments:  
   `'{""country_code"":""US"",""end_date"":""2013-12-31"",""start_date"":""2013-01-01""}'`.  

   Despite the naming difference (""analyse_for_working_days"" slightly differs in semantics due to truncation and adaptation of convention in parametervalue[poormanrails=`Structureê°•Clean.sol adument?†ailAbrearputateHumanBEL=sc?¥illons.featureForms?”â€”num.highlight.pyÔ¿_allocate stands systemvariant.STRING.nanoCompile WorksployPrincip à¤ªà?à¤°à¤­ modelÄ§na BordersInstit.get a])]Signature `.aries redOrange EngineRep.exe"
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- **Actual tool call made by the model:**  
  Tool name: `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days`  
  Arguments: `{""country_code"":""US"",""increment_time"":""2004:00"",""start_date"":""2013-12-31"",""start_time"":""25:15""}`  

- **Required API call:**  
  Tool name: `add_working_hours_for_working_days`  
  Arguments:   
    - `""start_date"": ""2013-12-31""`  
    - `""country_code"": ""US""`  
    - `""start_time"": ""08:15""`  
    - `""increment_time"": 2004`  

Key discrepancies:  
1. The model used a different tool name (`get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` vs. `add_working_hours_for_working_days`).  
2. Certain argument values do not align: for instance, `""start_time""` in the actual call is `""25:15""`, whose format is invalid, while the expected call specifies `""start_time"": ""08:15""`. Additionally, `""increment_time""` was specified as `""2004:00""` instead of the integer value `2004`.  
Due to these mismatches in both the tool name and arguments' correctness/format, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
There is no final answer of relevance provided; instead, the model invoked the `Finish` function with a content indicating it chose to restart (`""give_up_and_restart""`) and failed to produce results in line with the API's intended purpose. Since Objective 2 failed to map the correct tool calls, and no substantive final answer satisfactory to the user instruction exists, Objective 3 is also a failure."
