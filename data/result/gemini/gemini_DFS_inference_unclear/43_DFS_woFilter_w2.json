The result returned two movies with the same title but different years, indicating a potential issue with the API's search. It didn't actually find similar movies.\n\nTo try a different approach, I will attempt to use the `find_similar_for_similar_movies` API.  However, I need a movie ID to proceed.  The previous response provided two IDs: '84915-after-everything' and '66350-after-everything'. I'll try both.\n\n\nQuestion: Which movie ID should I use for `find_similar_for_similar_movies`? Should I try both IDs separately or is there a preference for the 2023 version?\n",
