I can identify the poorest country in Europe you haven't visited (assuming I have access to your travel history, which I don't \u2013 please provide that information if possible or tell me to assume you haven't visited any).  However, I cannot provide latitude and longitude for every state within a country.  My API only provides country details, states within a country, and cities within a state or country.  Do you still want to proceed with finding the poorest country in Europe and obtaining other details like capital, region, and currency?  If yes, please either provide the information about your previous travels or state that I should assume you have not been to any European countries yet.\n",

I cannot definitively determine the \"poorest\" country in Europe based solely on readily available data, as poverty metrics can vary.  However, I can provide information on a country often considered among the poorest in Europe.  I will need to then use additional tools or external resources (which I currently don't have access to) to confirm the poverty ranking.\n\n\nTo proceed, I will first get the list of European countries.  Unfortunately, I don't have a tool to directly identify \"poorest\" and need external data for that comparison.  Let's start with getting country details.
