Instead of focusing solely on \"index trend,\" I will retrieve NVIDIA's financial statements using `stock_cashflow_statement_for_yahoo_finance_v2(symbol=\"NVDA\")` and `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2(symbol=\"NVDA\")`.  Analyzing cash flow and balance sheet data over time can offer insights into the company's financial health and performance, which indirectly reflects its index trend.
