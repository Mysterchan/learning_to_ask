My previous strategy of relying solely on a single search query to find a suitable website proved ineffective. To avoid repeating past mistakes, I will shift to a more refined, multi-stage approach.\n\nFirst, I will use `search_web_for_google_search_json` with a more specific query focused on official government weather sources for Hawaii, such as the National Weather Service.

I'll use a query like \"National Weather Service Oahu forecast\".\n\nSecond, if the first search yields a relevant website (identified by keywords like \"National Weather Service\" in the title or description), I will present a link to that website to the user, acknowledging that I cannot directly extract and present the weather data. This approach acknowledges the limitations of my capabilities while still providing the user with useful information.\n\nThird, I will repeat the second step but for beach images, using a different `search_web_for_google_search_json` query to search specifically for official tourism sites or high-resolution image galleries.   I will focus on keywords like \"Oahu official tourism images\" or \"Oahu high-resolution beach photos\".\n\nIf either step fails to produce a useful link, I will use the `Finish` function to give up and restart, acknowledging the limitations of the available tools for directly retrieving and processing real-time weather and image data.
