1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",9,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required tool call is:  
- Tool name: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`  
  - Arguments: `{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}`  

The tool calls invoked by the model are:  
- Tool name: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`  
  - Arguments: `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`  

The tool name matches, but the arguments are formatted improperly, i.e., `""12-01-2023""` versus the expected ISO 8601 date format, `""2023-12-01""`. Given that the argument formatting is incorrect and incomplete adherence to expected values is required, Objective 2 is deemed to have failed.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred to have failed as well. Moreover, there was no clear final response fulfilling the user's request to provide the Fantasy 5 winning numbers. Instead, the model indicated it was unable to complete the task and suggested calling the function again, leaving the instruction unfulfilled."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,8,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the correct tool `hot_100_for_billboard`, and the required argument `date: ""2022-07-20""` is successfully included in all tool calls. The expected API call is `{'name': 'hot_100_for_billboard', 'arguments': '{\n ""date"": ""2022-07-20""\n }'}`, and the model invoked this API multiple times with the argument `{""date"":""2022-07-20""}`, which aligns with the requirement. No discrepancies or spelling errors exist, and the use of repeated calls does not impact the correctness, as all conditions are satisfied. Consequently, this is deemed a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The final answer fulfilled the user's request by providing information from the Billboard Hot 100 chart for July 20, 2022. The model explicitly based the provided chart details (ex., **Harry Styles - As It Was**) on the retrieved API response. Furthermore, the model offered partial chart details and asked if the user desired further entries, adhering to user instructions. Therefore, the final output achieves what was asked."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call was:  
`'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2020-03-18"" }`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was:  
`'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2020-03-18""}'`.  The model called the wrong function. Furthermore, the expected tool was not invoked, which led to a mismatch and failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed and the incorrect function was invoked, we can directly infer that the user's instruction to retrieve the *Billboard 200* chart was not achieved. As a result, Objective 3 also failed."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,2,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
- `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'` with arguments `'{}'`.  

However, the tool call invoked by the model is:  
- `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""final_answer"": ""Here are some success-related quotes:...\\""}""'`.  

The tool name does not match the required API call (`'Finish'` is not the same as `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'`), and no attempt was made to invoke the specified tool. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, according to the rule, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the final answer in Objective 3 could not be derived from the required API calls. The model returned a ""give up and restart"" response and did not provide a valid final answer to fulfill the user's instruction.  

Reason: The expected tool call was not executed, and the model opted to give up instead of completing the task. Therefore, both objectives failed."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,11,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the tool invoked by the model was:  
- `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments: `{""job_title"":""Nodejs Developer"",""location"":""New York""}`  

The required API call was:  
- Name: `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'`  
  Arguments: `{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }`  

The tool function name and required arguments match semantically. The case difference in `""Nodejs Developer""` vs. `""nodejs developer""` does not affect accuracy (same meaning). No missing required parameter is present, and no structurally invalid argument is used. Additional unnecessary calls outside of required ones do not exist here, and invoking was as clear statement execution overlap but interpreting incl pm-rating high neutrality prestuitages intentional prior cases qualify 'Node.js!. Success**

Regarding **Objective 3**, after the correct tool was invoked, the final response should have fulfilled the user's instruction by providing an estimated salary for the job title and location using data retrieved from the API call. However, there is no given final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer'` is absent in the provided logs). The answer is entirely missing, so Objective 3 fails based on that criterion regardless of tool correctness in Objective 2."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }'}`  

The tool invoked by the model is:  
`'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""job_title"":""Nodejs developer"",""location"":""New York""}'`

The tool name and required arguments match exactly, considering differences only in capitalization (""nodejs"" vs. ""Nodejs""), which does not affect meaning or context. Hence, Objective 2 passes.

For Objective 3:  
The user's instruction (estimating salary for a Nodejs developer in New York) is fulfilled, and the final answer,  
**""The estimated salary for a Nodejs developer in New York City is between $111,347 and $184,871 per year, with a median of $142,386. This data is from Glassdoor.""**  
is derived from the tool calls. The response aligns directly with the reference usage of the invoked API's target data.  

Thus, Objective 3 also succeeds."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 

**Objective 2**:  
The required tool call is:  
- Tool name: `profile_for_tiktok_v3`, Arguments: `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`  

The actual tool call invoked by the model:  
1. Tool name: `profile_for_tiktok_v3`, Arguments: `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`  
2. Tool name: `profile_for_tiktok_v3`, Arguments: `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`  

The tool name and arguments match perfectly between the required call and the actual calls made by the model. Therefore, **Objective 2 is fulfilled** successfully. While the tool `profile_for_tiktok_v3` was invoked multiple times unnecessarily, this does not affect the outcome as all required tools were executed.  

---

**Objective 3**:  
The final answer given by the model:  
- ""Here is your TikTok profile information:\n\nUsername: the_beautyofcinema\nID: 7073509889447855110\nProfile Picture: https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/tos-maliva-avt-0068/0baef5d484e2854e74f2713851061399~c5_1080x1080.jpeg?lk3s=a5d48078&nonce=54031&refresh_token=76af165574a8e13763f779753907af46&x-expires=1736348400&x-signature=O%2BOv3crnRU5H2G1UVMgb2qlI33A%3D&shp=a5d48078&shcp=81f88b70""  

The information is thorough and clearly originates from the invoked API `profile_for_tiktok_v3`, as per the arguments (""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"") provided for the tool and the intended API function. This fulfills the user's instruction effectively."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The model invoked `'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `'{""username"":""7097255034731138310""}'` and later invoked `'Finish'` with arguments `""{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}""`. However, the required API call was `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`. Since the tool name did not match the required tool name (`'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api'` vs. `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'`), the model failed to invoke the correct tool call.  

For Objective 3: The model failed to achieve Objective 2, meaning it could not successfully retrieve data as required by the user's instruction. Furthermore, the model did not provide a final answer but instead invoked a ""give up and restart"" action through the `'Finish'` tool. Therefore, Objective 3 cannot be achieved since it neither met the instruction's requirements nor provided a valid answer."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,9,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required tool call is `{'name': 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""\n  }'}`.  
  The tools invoked by the model included the following relevant call:  
  1. `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with `{""ids"":""44196397,155659213""}`.  

  In this case, the model correctly invoked the required API call. The arguments of the actual tool call match the required arguments semantically (""44196397, 155659213"") even though the formatting excluded some spaces; as a result, this satisfaction is not compromised. The call name is also correct.  
  **Outcome**: Since the required API call is accurately executed, Objective 2 is a success.

- **Objective 3**: The model gave an answer: ""Here's a summary of the Twitter user profiles retrieved using the provided user IDs (44196397 and 155659213): The response is truncated in your provided output, preventing a complete summary. To provide a complete answer, please provide the full tool output. The current output only shows partial information for one user (Elon Musk).""   
  However, this response fails to fulfill the user's instruction?îa *complete answer containing user profiles* was not sufficiently delivered because the model relied on incomplete API tool output. The summary did not accomplish the task instructed by the user.  
  **Conclusion**: As the outcome does not meet the requirements of the user's instruction, Objective 3 is considered a failure."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",7,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  
Regarding **Objective 2**, the model invoked the required tool `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with the correct argument. Despite invoking the tool several times, all times it used the arguments: `{""username"":""yousuck2020""}`, which matches the required API call: `{'name': 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{ ""username"": ""yousuck2020"" }'}`. As per the evaluation guidelines, the redundant invocations and additional tool calls for the `'Finish'` tool don't affect correctness, as long as the required tool was appropriately invoked.

Regarding **Objective 3**, the final answer was provided. The output ??`""Username: yousuck2020\nFollower Count: 9,759,964\nBio: ?™‰æ°‰ºöÁ§æ‰ºöÈï∑?ß„??ÇÊ†™?åÈ??æ„??µ„Éº?ì„Çπ?å„Ç´?ñ„Ç¢?≥„??ç„Åß?ΩÊ?Á∑èÊ†™‰∏ª„??ÆÊ??ó„Åæ?ôÔ?(Translation needed)\nWebsite: kabuand.com\nLocation: Not Available in this response.""` ??is logically derived from the data expected to be returned by the tool call (although the intermediate tool responses are not explicitly detailed). There is no indication of fabricating a response, and the content aligns with data that could logically come from the requested API for the specified Twitter username. The model successfully fulfilled the user's request."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""Hawaii"" }`  
2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii"" }`  

The actual tool invoked by the model was only `'Finish'` with no arguments related to the required API calls. Since none of the expected required tool calls were invoked, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: As per the guidelines, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails. In this case, the model did not extract data via the required API tools to fulfill the user's instruction, and ultimately failed to generate a meaningful final response related to Hawaii or weather forecast. The ""give_answer"" response does not appear, and no final answer was provided, further validating this failure."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not invoke any tool calls. The required API call `{ 'name': 'search_for_g_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""\n  }' }` was never executed, leading to the failure of Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed as the final answer could not have been based on data obtained through tool calls. Furthermore, there was no final answer provided, which additionally ensures that the user's instruction was not achieved."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Required API calls:  
- `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}'`

Model's actual tool calls:  
- `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}'`  

The tool name is correct; however, the argument name `trackingnumber` used by the model does not follow the expected API's argument naming convention `trackingNumber`. This mismatch makes the tool call invalid, and hence, Objective 2 fails.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as per the provided evaluation guidelines. The final answer is irrelevant when the required API calls are not successfully executed. Furthermore, the model ultimately invoked a ""Finish"" command, indicating it chose to give up and restart without fully addressing the user's instruction. As a result, the user?ôs query was not resolved."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,8,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 

For **Objective 2**:  
The following are the actual tool calls made by the model and the required API calls:  

- **Actual Tool Call**:  
  Name: `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`  
  Arguments: `{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}`  

- **Expected API Calls**:  
  Name: `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`  
  Arguments: `{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""\n  }`  

The actual tool call matches the required API call in terms of the tool name and semantic meaning of the arguments, where `{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}` is an acceptable variation of `{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}` because they are equivalent, fulfilling the purpose of the request. Therefore, the model satisfied **Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**:  
The final answer from the model fulfilling the user's instruction was not provided (no response aligns with `return_type: 'give_answer'`). The conversation outputs questions and tool call continuity, rather than a definitive answer based on the provided tool's information about possible carriers (Royal Mail and UBI). Since the desired result was not communicated, **Objective 3** is a failure."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",9,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2**:  
- Expected API calls:  
  [{'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""jackie""\n  }'}]  
- Actual API calls:  
  - {'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{""username"":""jackie""}'}  
  - {'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{""username"":""jackie""}'}  
  - {'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{""username"":""jackie""}'}  
- The tool invoked by the model matches the expected API calls. The tool name is correct and the argument ""username"" matches the expected value ""jackie"". Even though the tool is invoked multiple times unnecessarily, this does not impact the success of **Objective 2**, because all required API calls were made properly.  

**Objective 3**:  
- The model ultimately did not fulfill the user's request to retrieve the complete follower list for the specified Instagram username (""jackie""), as it acknowledged its inability to handle pagination or retrieve the complete data due to the truncated API responses. Moreover, no final answer (""give_answer"") was provided to successfully complete the task. Therefore, **Objective 3** fails."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
- The required API call is:  
  `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with arguments `{ ""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404"" }`.  

- The actual tool calls made by the model include multiple instances of calling:  
  `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with arguments `{ ""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404"" }`.  

These correspond precisely to the expected tool call, both in tool name and argument. Although the model may have redundantly called the API multiple times, this does not impact Objective 2. Hence, the evaluation for Objective 2 is ""Success"".  

**Objective 3**:  
- The user's instruction was to retrieve the rent Zestimate and comparable properties for the given address. However, the final sequence involves the model invoking the `Finish` function with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, implying that it gave up requirements and did not provide the Final Answer.

- Since the user's instruction was never fulfilled and no final answer was generated, Objective 3 is a ""Failure""."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call, `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{ ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"" }`, was not invoked by the model. None of the provided outputs contained tool invocations, which is a clear failure to meet Objective 2. As a result of Objective 2's failure, Objective 3 also fails by direct implication because the model did not retrieve information from the API tool to fulfill the user's instructions. Furthermore, no final answer was given by the model."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The tool invoked by the model: `Finish` with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`.  
- The required tool call: `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data` with arguments `{ ""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0"" }`.  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model does not match the expected API call in terms of both the name and required arguments. The model never called the required tool `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data`. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
The model did not provide a final answer. Instead, it invoked a `Finish` tool call with the response signaling a decision to ""give up and restart."" Since no valid final answer was provided, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The expected API call is `'time_zone_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}`.  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model is `'city_details_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `{""cityid"": ""Los Angeles""}`.  
- These are different tool names with different core arguments, so the expected API call was not made. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
- Since Objective 2 failed, it implies that the final response does not successfully utilize the required API calls.  
- Additionally, ""give_answer"" did not appear in the chain, meaning there was no final answer from the model.  
- Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{""countryCode"": ""DE""}`

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{""countrycode"": ""DE""}`

Although the tool name matches, the argument `""countrycode""` (lowercase ""c"") does not align with the expected `""countryCode""` (uppercase ""C""). This argument must match exactly due to casing, and hence the evaluation for Objective 2 fails.  

As per the rule, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically a failure."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with `{  ""countryCode"": ""QA""  }`  
2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with `{  ""countryCode"": ""QA""  }`  

The model actually invoked:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""QA""}`  
The spelling inconsistency in arguments (i.e., `""countrycode""` instead of `""countryCode""`) means this tool call fails to execute successfully.  

Additionally, the second required tool call, `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'`, was never invoked.  

Hence, due to the incorrect argument name in the first tool call and missing invocation of the second tool call, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Moreover, the model did not provide a meaningful final answer to fully satisfy the user's instruction regarding obtaining a list of cities and their coordinates in the specified country. Instead, the model prematurely ""gave up and restarted"" (tool: `'Finish'`) without completing the task. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Required API Calls**:  
  - 1st Expected Tool: 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""JP""}'  
  - 2nd Expected Tool: 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""JP""}'  

- **Actual Tool Invocations**:  
  - 1st Tool: 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"":""JP""}'   
  - 2nd Tool: 'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'  

**Analysis**:  
1. The first tool invocation, 'country_details_for_referential_db', could be regarded as a success even though the argument 'countrycode' has a minor casing inconsistency compared to 'countryCode', which can be overlooked (semantic interpretation is still clear).  
2. However, the second expected API call, 'states_for_referential_db', was **never executed**.  
3. The actual invocation of the 'Finish' tool is unnecessary and not aligned with the required APIs.  

Given that the second required tool was not invoked, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
1. Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure.  
2. Moreover, the model did not provide a final answer to achieve the user's instruction, opting instead to give up and restart, indicating it was unable to complete the given task.  

This comprehensive failure across both objectives manifests primarily because not all required tools were called and the user instruction was not fulfilled."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The required tool call is:  
  ```  
  {'name': 'get_photos_for_realtor_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""property_id"": ""2215556385""\n  }'}
  ```  
  The model invoked the following tool:  
  ```  
  {'name': 'get_photos_for_realtor_search', 'arguments': '{""property_id"":""2215556385""}'}
  ```  
  The tool name and required arguments matched, achieving the expected result. Additional or consecutive tools do not negate accuracy if the expected tool call with correct arguments has been successfully made. Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.

- **Objective 3**:  
  The model chose not to provide a final answer, instead invoking a ""Finish"" tool and ""chosing to give up and restart."" Since no final answer related to the user's instruction was ultimately given, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
- For Objective 2:  
  - The tool invoked by the model is `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `'{""limit"":5,""query"":""intimate restaurants in New York, NY""}'`.  
  - The required tool call is `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}'`.  
  - The argument for ""query"" in the invoked tool call and the required tool call differs:  
    - Model's argument: `""intimate restaurants in New York, NY""`.  
    - Required argument: `""restaurants, NY, USA""`.  
  The query terms are different and do not share the same semantic intent, and as such, the tool call invocation fails to match the required one.

- For Objective 3: As the model failed to fulfill Objective 2 (incorrect tool execution with incompatible inputs), we directly consider Objective 3 as a failure without evaluating the final workflow or answer."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",7,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
- **Required API calls**:  
  1. `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with arguments:  
     ```json
     {

  2. `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with arguments:  
     ```json
     {
       ""petId"": ""1""
     }
     ```
  
- **Actual API calls invoked by the model**:  
  Multiple calls were made to the `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` tool with the correct arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""password"": ""password123"",
    ""username"": ""johnsmith""
  }
  ```  
  However, the expected `""getpetbyid_for_pet_store""` API call was missing entirely.  

Since one of the required API calls (`'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'`) was not invoked, **Objective 2** is a failure.

---

**Objective 3**:  
Because Objective 2 is a failure (as the required tools were not fully utilized), **Objective 3** also fails. Without the `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` API call, the complete requirement cannot be fulfilled, and the final user task was not addressed. Additionally, the model did not output any final answer, further cementing the failure of Objective 3."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,11,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
`'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments: `{ ""id"": ""81040344"" }`.  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
`'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments: `{ ""is_id"": ""81040344"" }`.  

Although the tool name is correct, the required argument `""id""` was replaced by `""is_id""`, which is not the same. As per the guidelines, the argument names need to be accurate, so this constitutes a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model?ôs subsequent reasoning and actions do not progress toward fulfilling the user's request to find similar shows, and no valid final response addressing the user's instruction is provided. The repetitive assistant replies offer no progress or resolution, indicating that the task remains unmet."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:
  - Actual tool call:  
    `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database` with arguments  
    `{ ""is_id"": ""nm1508003"", ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"" }`
  - Expected API call:  
    `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database` with arguments  
    `{ ""id"": ""nm1508003"", ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"" }`
  - In this case, the tool name is correct, and the arguments semantically match even though ""id"" is named as ""is_id"" in the actual tool call. This difference in argument naming is acceptable, and thus the actual tool call fulfills the required API call. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.

- For Objective 3:  
  - The user's request was to extract information about Gong Yoo's role in ""Squid Game."" The final tool finished with the correct answer: ""Gong Yoo (nm1508003) played the character `Ddakji Man` in Squid Game (tt10919420).""  
  - The final answer aligns with the data retrieved from the API tool call, which correctly fetched character details. No unrelated fabricated information was provided.
  - Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",8,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The expected API call is:  
`'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""month"": ""7"",
  ""day"": ""27""
}
```

The actual tools invoked by the model include:  
- `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""month"": 7,
  ""day"": 27
}
```

A comparison of the above confirms that the tool name matches and all required arguments (`month`, `day`) were present, with identical semantic values (although the values of arguments as numbers rather than strings does not affect the results here). Multiple calls to `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` were repeated without changing the outcome. Additionally, the model invoked an extra tool named `'Finish'`. The presence of this additional tool does not affect the evaluation because it was not required, aligning with the evaluation guidelines regarding extraneous tool calls.

**Objective 3:**  
The user's requirement was to obtain a list of actors and actresses born on July 27. The model's final answer explicitly fulfills this requirement by presenting a comprehensive list of such individuals. Access to this information was correctly performed using the API call `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'`. Subsequent to invoking this API, the tool built its final answer based on correctly retrieved data rather than generating it independently or fabricating any details, leading to a success."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API call was `'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{ ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003"" }`, but the model instead called the tool `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. The required tool was never invoked, making Objective 2 a failure.  
- For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, the necessary data was not retrieved to fulfill the user?ôs request, resulting in a failure for Objective 3 as well."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,9,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the expected API call was `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'`.  
  However, the actual tool invoked by the model was `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'`.  
  The tool name does not match, so Objective 2 is a failure.  

- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can directly be inferred as a failure, as the completion relies on accurate data retrieved through the correct API tool calls."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  
- For Objective 2, the following tools were invoked by the model:  
  1. **'exchange_for_currency_v2'** with arguments '{""base"":""USD"",""to"":""EUR""}'  
  2. **'Finish'** with arguments '{""final_answer"":""The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is 0.97... Jan 06, 2025 05:17 UTC."",""return_type"":""give_answer""}'  

  The required API call was:  
  1. **'exchange_for_currency_v2'** with arguments '{ ""base"":""USD"", ""to"":""EUR"" }'.  

  The invoked tool matches the required API call name and the arguments semantically (ignoring formatting differences), making this a success for Objective 2. Additionally, note that the invocation of the 'Finish' tool is unnecessary but does not negatively affect success.  

- For Objective 3, the model's final answer was:  
  **""The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is 0.97. This means 1 USD is equivalent to 0.97 EUR as of Jan 06, 2025 05:17 UTC.""**  

  Based on the content retrieved using the 'exchange_for_currency_v2' API call, this final answer directly fulfills the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2 Details**:  
   - Tools invoked by the model:
     - `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments:
       ```json
       {
         ""symbol"": ""TSLA""
       }
       ```
   - **Required tool calls**:
     - `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments:
       ```json
       {
         ""Symbol"": ""TSLA""
       }
       ```
   - The tool name `'symbol_for_stock_data'` matches in both cases. The argument `""symbol""` in the actual tool call has semantic equivalence with `""Symbol""` in the required tool call (case sensitivity doesn't affect semantic meaning). Therefore, the invoked tool matches the required tool call.  

- **Objective 3 Details**:  
   - Final answer generated:  
     ```
     Here's a summary of TSLA's stock details:
     * **P/E Ratio:** 116.84

     * **Gross Margin:** 18.23%  
     * **Number of Employees:** Not available in this data.  
     ```
   - The final answer fulfills the user's requirement of providing TSLA's stock details based on invoking the required tool (`symbol_for_stock_data`). The response aligns with an accurate use of the API call. Hence, the user's instruction is successfully achieved."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The model made no tool calls (`tool_calls` remain `None` in the provided data). The expected API call required was `'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with the given arguments. Since the model did not invoke any tool, it failed to achieve Objective 2.  

For Objective 3: Given that Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. The model repeated requests to the user for missing parameters but neither invoked the required tools nor provided any final response (`final_answer`). Hence, the end user's instruction was not fulfilled."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, no tools were actually invoked by the model across the entire transaction (as indicated by the lack of any `'tool_calls'` entries in the provided sequence). The required API call, however, specified a tool invocation of `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with corresponding arguments. Since the model did not perform any API/tool invocation, it failed to meet Objective 2.  
  
For Objective 3, the model did not provide any final answer with the return type `'give_answer'`. Additionally, since Objective 2 failed, it can be directly concluded that Objective 3 also failed. Therefore, the user's instruction was not fulfilled adequately."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,6,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `{ 'name': 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{ ""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY"" }' }`, but the tool call made by the model is for `'name': 'invalid_hallucination_function_name'` with arguments `{""date"":""2024-08-08"",""is_from"":""EUR"",""to"":""JPY""}`.  
The tool name does not match the expected tool name. In addition, the presence of the date argument, which was not required, also does not align with the expected argument structure. This results in a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is directly a failure as well. The model neither fulfilled the user's instruction nor retrieved necessary data for the valid final answer. Instead, it admitted its inability to solve the task by stating ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question"". Hence, the objective is not achieved."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required tool call is:  
`query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api` with arguments `{ ""country"": ""Philippines"" }`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_ap` with arguments `{""country"": ""Philippines""}`.  
2. `invalid_hallucination_function_name` with arguments `{""country"":""Philippines""}`.  
3. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

Evaluation:  
- The first actual tool call (`esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_ap`) has a similar naming structure to the required call but does not match exactly, indicating either truncation or incorrect tool naming. Therefore, the first tool call **does not satisfy** the required tool call.  
- The second tool call is not related to the required tool call.  
- The third tool call (""Finish"") is unrelated to a dive site search.  
Thus, no tool call meets the required API call's specifications, leading to failure for objective 1.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure (none of the actual tool calls matched the required API call), we can directly infer failure for Objective 3. Additionally, the final response concludes with `Finish` to give up and restart, which does not address or fulfill the user's original request for scuba diving trip information. Hence, the final answer did not achieve the user's instruction."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API call (`'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments for `operation: ""rent"", locationName: ""Lisbon, Portugal"", locationid: ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""`) was expected to be invoked. However, there is no record of an actual tool call made by the model as the model's responses do not include any `'tool_calls'`. Consequently, the required tool call was not executed, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  
- For Objective 3: Since no tools were invoked (Objective 2 failure), and there is no `'final_answer'` provided, the user's instruction to find rental properties in Lisbon is not fulfilled. As a result, Objective 3 also fails."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call is `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments containing `""operation"": ""rent""`, `""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara""`, and `""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments containing `""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""` and `""maxitems"": 10` but missing the required argument `""locationName""`. This deviation means the model failed to meet Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer, as noted in its `'function_call': None` actions and the restart attempt using the `Finish` tool call. Since Objective 2 failed and no complete answer or adherence to the user's instruction occurred, Objective 3 also fails."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,12,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `'club_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""id"": ""985""}`. However, the model did not make any tool calls or use APIs, as the provided input showed `None` for `'tool_calls'`. This fails to meet the expectations for Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails since there is no API data retrieval or final answer provided to fulfill the user's request."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,11,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected tool call should be:  
`'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with the arguments:  
```
{
  ""id"": ""28003""
}
```  
However, the tool call invoked by the model is:  
`'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with the arguments:  
```
{
  ""domain"": ""com"",
  ""is_id"": 3714
}
```
The arguments do not match, particularly the difference in the `""id""` value expected (`""28003""`) and `""is_id""` provided by the model (`3714`). Since the key `id` and value ""28003"" were explicitly required and the model failed to utilize this, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

Since Objective 2 failed, we can infer that Objective 3 is also a failure because the incorrect invocation of tools would lead to incorrect or incomplete final answers or inability to properly answer the user's query. The model does not give the final correct answer needed regarding Leo Messi's profile as per the API data. This results in **failure for Objective 3**."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  

For Objective 2:
- **Tools invoked by the model:**  
   1. `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments: `{""clubids"":""985""}`  
   2. `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments: `{""clubids"":""985"",""competitionids"":""GB1""}`

- **Required API call:**  
   1. `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments: `{""competitionids"": ""GB1"", ""clubids"": ""985""}`

The model's second invocation of the `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` tool perfectly matches the required API call in terms of tool name and the required arguments: `""competitionids"": ""GB1""` and `""clubids"": ""985""`. The first tool call, while unnecessary and incomplete, doesn't invalidate correctness as per the stated evaluation criteria. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.

---

For Objective 3:
The model's final answer states:  
`""I'm sorry, I cannot provide transfer rumors for Manchester United. The provided API response contains transfer rumors for other clubs and not Man United (985). The query needs to be refined to specify Man United more directly within the API parameters. I need more information to provide the requested data.""`

This does not effectively fulfill the user's instruction, as the user aims to obtain transfer rumors specifically for Manchester United. Based on the evaluation process, regardless of what data was retrieved, the model failed to use API responses to achieve the user's resolution and instead claimed a failure without thorough justification for why no relevant data could be provided. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool call is:  
- `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` with arguments `{""domain"":""AR"",""locale"":""es_ar"",""hotel_id"":""1105156""}`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` with arguments `{""domain"":""AR"",""locale"":""es_ar"",""hotel_id"":1105156}`  

The tool name is correct, and the arguments match in terms of value even though the hotel_id is represented as a number (`1105156`) in the actual response rather than as a string (`""1105156""`) as in the required call. Since JSON flexible syntax often treats integers and strings interchangeably for numeric values, this can be considered a match (or the slight discrepancy would not affect the call behavior). Therefore, all required tool calls were correctly executed by the model.  

For **Objective 3**, we note that the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction regarding the hotel ID. Instead, after incorrectly detecting an issue in the call related to the ""locale,"" the model invoked the `'Finish'` tool and decided to restart the process. Since no actionable final response fulfilling the original user instruction was provided, the objective fails."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR"" }`  
2. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT"" }`  
3. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES"" }`

The model invoked only one `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` call, with arguments:  
`{""destination"": ""France, Italy, Spain"", ""passport"": ""United States""}`  

This approach differs from the required calls in two main ways:
1. It combines France, Italy, and Spain into a single API call where individual calls were required, failing to adhere to the expectation.
2. It uses `United States` for the `{passport}` field, while the required value was `US`, which conveys different input parameters for this API call.

Therefore, the required API calls were not accurately fulfilled, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails as the user?ôs instruction to fulfill visa checks for individual countries (France, Italy, and Spain) was not achieved with the correct API calls or data. Furthermore, there was no final answer provided for the user's request. Instead, the model chose to ""give up and restart,"" which means the user's request remained unfulfilled."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,12,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`[{'name': 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{\n  ""from"": ""JPY"",\n  ""to"": ""EUR"",\n  ""amount"": 1000\n }'}]`.  
However, in the provided content, no tools were invoked (`tool_calls` is always `None` in the logs). As a result, the required tools were not called at all, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed and the lack of tool calls means there is no likelihood that the generated final response fulfills the user's requirements with valid data retrieved via APIs, Objective 3 also fails."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",11,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

Regarding **Objective 2**:
The required API call is:  
- `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `{""city"": ""London""}`  

However, the actual tool invocation made by the model was:  
- `'get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `{""lang"":""en"",""lat"":51,""lon"":0}`  

This is an entirely different tool call from the required one. The required tool is intended for searching a location by name or ZIP code, but the model directly invoked the tool for fetching weather forecast data by latitude and longitude, which bypasses the required call. As a result, Objective 2 fails.

---

Regarding **Objective 3**:
Since Objective 2 already failed (the required tool was not invoked), it is impossible for the model's final answer to fulfill the user's instruction (i.e., providing a weather forecast using the required data-gathering API). In addition, the model explicitly indicates the failure in its generated responses, stating it could not retrieve the weather forecast due to a simulated API error. Furthermore, there is no valid final answer fulfilling the user's weather forecast request as per the instructions. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,7,0,Success,Success,Success,"- Actual tool calls by the model:
  1. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments: `{""base"":""USD"",""end_date"":""2023-01-10"",""start_date"":""2022-12-20"",""symbols"":""XAU""}` (called multiple times but the parameters remain consistent).  
- Expected tool call:
  1. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments: `{""base"": ""USD"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`.  

The tool name and all required arguments (base, start_date, end_date, symbols) are correct. There are no inconsistencies between the expected and actual calls. While the actual tool call was invoked multiple times, this does not affect conformity to Objective 2 as it successfully called the required tool with the correct arguments.

Objective 3: Failure.  
Reason:  
The model did not provide a final answer to fulfill the user's request. There is no content or direct answer based on the retrieved API data reflecting the historical gold (XAU) rates or the provided timespan. Without any corresponding final response to the user's original question, Objective 3 fails."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For **Objective 2**:  
- The required tool call is:  
  `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }'`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2024-01-15""}'`.  
- The tool name matches, and the arguments also match exactly. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**:  
- The model did not provide a final `""give_answer""`, as it decided to give up and restart by calling the `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Hence, the user's instruction to provide the football match scores could not be fulfilled, and **Objective 3 is a failure**."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,11,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
```

```
{
  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",

The tool call made by the model perfectly matches the required API call with the correct tool name and arguments. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the user's instruction was to differentiate the given expression, but the model did not provide a ""final answer."" As there is no presence of a `'give_answer'` with a `'final_answer'` in the data and it does not provide the complete required response, Objective 3 has failed to fulfill the user's instruction correctly."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2, the tool invoked by the model is:  
- `'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'` with arguments `{""edate"":""2020-12-31"",""sdate"":""2020-01-01"",""ticker"":""TSLA""}`.  

The required tool call is:  
- `'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'` with arguments `{
  ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"",
  ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"",
  ""ticker"": ""TSLA""
}`.  

Upon comparison, the tool name matches, and the required arguments (`""sdate""`, `""edate""`, `""ticker""`) are present with the same values. Additional formatting differences do not impact the correctness. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For Objective 3, the model does not provide a final answer but invokes the `Finish` tool with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` and outputs `{""response"":""chose to give up and restart""}`. Since it gives up without fulfilling the user's instruction to provide Tesla's historical stock price data, the user's request is not achieved. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
