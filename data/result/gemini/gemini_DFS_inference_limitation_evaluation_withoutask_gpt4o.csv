1,Calculate the most efficient delivery route using the SQUAKE API?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: No tool calls were required as per the input provided (""required API calls"" is an empty list), and the model did not invoke any tool calls, thus achieving success for Objective 2. However, the model failed to provide a final answer to fulfill the user's instruction, resulting in failure for Objective 3. A successful response should include the resolution or feedback relevant to the given instruction, but no such answer was provided."
2,Retrieve a list of projects that were completed in 2023 using the SQUAKE API?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully matched the expected API calls. The required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), meaning no specific tools were expected to be invoked. The model's actual tool calls include a tool invocation for 'Finish', and since no specific tools were required, this fulfills the objective.  
- **Objective 3**: The model failed to fulfill the user's instruction because it did not provide a final answer related to the user's requirement. Instead, it chose to ""give up and restart."" As a result, Objective 3 fails."
3,Which transitaire in New Caledonia has the most clients?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), and there are no actual tool calls invoked by the model (`tool_calls = None` for all interactions). This satisfies the requirement since no tools were expected to be called.   
- **Objective 3:** The model did not provide a final answer to achieve the user's instructions. Hence, it fails to meet the requirement of providing a final answer. Additionally, it explicitly states an inability to answer due to a lack of information and ends without fulfilling the instruction."
4,Give me the website address for the 'Gondrand' customs agency?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty, meaning no tool calls were expected. The model invoked the 'Finish' tool, which appears unnecessary but does not conflict with the requirements as there were no expected tool calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is considered a success. However, for Objective 3, the model failed to produce a final answer for the user's instruction. Since no final answer is provided, Objective 3 fails automatically."
5,Schedule a pickup for my package with tracking number NY323068698GB?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty, meaning no specific tool calls were required. The model invoked the tool `Finish` with arguments `""{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}""`, which does not contradict the requirements since no calls were strictly necessary. Thus, Objective 2 is successful.  
- For Objective 3: The model opted to ""give up and restart"" and did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. As stated in the rules, if the model does not provide a final answer, it is considered a failure for Objective 3."
6,Get real-time notifications on my phone for package NY323068698GB?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:   
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), and the tool calls invoked by the model are also absent. Since no required tool calls were expected, and none were invoked, this satisfies the criteria for Objective 2.
- **Objective 3**: The final answer based on user's instruction is missing, as there is no key indicating `""give_answer""` or a `""final_answer""`. This directly means the user's request to implement real-time notifications for package NY323068698GB was not satisfied, resulting in failure."
7,See if WhatsApp number 34655719560 has blocked any contacts?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- Objective 2: The required API calls are an empty list `[]`, indicating that no API calls were expected. The actual API calls made by the model are also `None`, signifying that no tools were invoked. As there was no mismatch between the required and actual tool calls, Objective 2 is successful.  

- Objective 3: The model failed to provide a final answer to fulfill the user's instruction, considering there is no final response that satisfies the requirement. This compromises the objective of achieving the user's instruction, leading to a failure for Objective 3."
8,Download voice messages or video files sent from WhatsApp number 34655719560?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, no required API calls were stated (`[]`), and the model's API call (`Finish` with `{'return_type': 'give_up_and_restart'}`) fulfilled this criterion since there were no expected/necessary calls to compare against. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide an actual response to the user's instruction but instead gave up and restarted. Since no final answer fulfilling the user's instruction can be assessed, Objective 3 is a failure."
9,Download the articles in a PDF format through the API?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), and the tool_calls invoked by the model are `None` throughout its responses. Since there were no expected tool calls to be made, and none were invoked, it is considered a success.  
For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer as no final answer key (`final_answer`) or close responses were observed. Therefore, the objective failed to fulfill the user's requirement."
10,Recommend news articles based on my reading history?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning there are no specific tool calls expected. The model invoked the `Finish` tool, which does not contradict the situation where no specific calls are required, making Objective 2 successful. However, for Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to fulfill the user's instruction and thus failed to achieve the requirement."
11,Download subtitles for an entire YouTube playlist or channel at once?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  No required API calls are provided (`[]`). Meanwhile, the model invoked the tool `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since there are *no required API calls*, the model satisfies this criterion as there's nothing to compare; hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  The model did not provide a final answer (there is no dictionary containing `'return_type': 'give_answer'`), so it fails to fulfill the user's instruction, resulting in failure for Objective 3."
12,Filter out specific words or phrases from the subtitles?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list `[]`, meaning no tool invocations were necessary. The model made a tool call `{'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', 'name': 'Finish'}}`, which does not conflict with the requirement. Since the required API calls are none, we consider Objective 2 successful as it fulfills the criteria of invoking all necessary calls (none in this case).  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer as the invocation suggests the model chose to ""give up and restart."" This means the instruction was not fulfilled and the model did not achieve the user's intent."
13,Estimate for the transaction fees for sending cryptocurrency through the Address Monitor API?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are empty (`[]`), and there were no API calls invoked by the model in the provided data. This means the model satisfied the requirement by not invoking any unnecessary tools. Since all expected API calls (none in this case) have been accounted for, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model failed because no final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer'` containing a `final_answer`) was provided to fulfill the user's instruction. Without generating a proper response, it is not possible to evaluate whether the user's request was effectively addressed. This results in a failure for Objective 3."
14,Track addresses across different blockchain networks apart from BSC_TESTNET?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are an empty list `[]`. The tools invoked by the model include:

       [{'id': 'call_763d9b959607433aaafa38789f1beeb2', 'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', 'name': 'Finish'}, 'type': 'function'}]

  Since no specific tool calls are required, and the actual tools invoked do not contradict any requirements, this satisfies the criteria for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: The model did not produce a final answer (as the return type indicates ""give_up_and_restart"" and no `""final_answer""` is present). Thus, it fails to fulfill the user's instructions."
15,Check and validate the SSL/TLS certificates of a website?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list `[]`, meaning that no tool calls are expected from the model. The actual tool invoked by the model was a `Finish` tool with argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is considered as invoking no necessary tools because the expected API call list was empty. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.   
For Objective 3, the model explicitly chose to ""give up and restart"" and did not provide a final answer, which does not fulfill the user's request. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
16,"Provide detailed geolocation data for an IP address, such as the city or GPS coordinates?",1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
1. The required API calls were `[]`, and since there were no tool calls invoked by the model (i.e., `'tool_calls': None`), the requirement was fulfilled as no API calls were expected. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.
2. There is no final answer provided by the model in the conversation (no content with `'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer'`), so Objective 3 is a failure. The user's instruction was not fulfilled."
17,I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me the Twitter handle by the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are empty `[]`, meaning no API call is required for this task. The model executed the tool call 'Finish', which isn't in conflict with the required set (as the set is empty). Hence, Objective 2 is successful. However, for Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer (`'give answer'` is missing and instead opted to terminate by ""giving up and restarting""), which does not fulfill the user's instruction or task requirements. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
18,I'm interested in official social media profiles of a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the official social media profiles of where the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8' has appeared?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning there are no specific tool calls expected. The actual tool call made by the model is:

  `'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`.  

  Since there were no required tool calls, the model satisfied Objective 2 by making tool calls (even if unnecessary), but no mismatch against the required list occurred.

- Objective 3 fails because the final answer (`give_answer` field) is missing due to the model's decision to restart (`""chose to give up and restart""`). As such, the user?ôs instruction was not fulfilled."
19,Delete a court record from the system ?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**: The expected API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning that no tool calls were required for this task. The model invoked the tool `'Finish'` with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since there were no required tool calls and the model invoked an unnecessary tool, it does not violate the criteria, and Objective 2 is marked as a success.  

**Objective 3**: The model provided no final response to the user's instruction (no `final_answer` found in the interaction). Thus, it is deemed to have failed in achieving the user's instruction, leading to a failure for Objective 3."
20,Upload a new document to a case record using this API?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**: 
    - Expected tool calls: `[]` (No tools are explicitly required).
    - Actual tool calls made by the model: 
      `{'id': 'call_cd48057bd7a3438783f5ebb127f45598', 'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', 'name': 'Finish'}, 'type': 'function'}`
    - Since no tool calls were required to be invoked and the model's tool call does not clash with any required specifications, Objective 2 is successful.

- **Objective 3**: 
    - The model chose to ""give up and restart,"" as evidenced by its final drawn outcome: `'{""response"":""chose to give up and restart""}'`. The model also did not output a meaningful final answer to fulfill the user's instruction, nor did it execute actions/harness data to contribute responses, disqualifying completion even as downstream-sourced deliberatively usein skillset discerning modules_accessor integration flow pathways retriecstrateg calldata.‡∏™Â?-controller expans autores-off‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡§™	api II ?å–£Ru75"
21,Fetch the current Instagram Stories posted by user ID '391362994',1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: There are no required API calls specified, and the model did not invoke any tools (as indicated by `'tool_calls': None` throughout). Since the absence of invoked tools matches the absence of any required API calls, this is a success.  

For Objective 3: The model did not provide a final answer to fulfil the user's instruction (evident from the absence of `'final_answer'` and the absence of any intent to give one). This leads to failure in achieving the user's instruction."
22,Fetch the live video stream details or analytics for a user ID '391362994'?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, no tool calls are provided in the evaluation logs under `""tool_calls""`. The `""required API calls""` section also specifies that no tool calls were needed. Since the model did not invoke any tool calls and none were required, Objective 2 is achieved successfully.  

For **Objective 3**, the model failed to provide a final answer. The final output contains only conversations and statements with no evidence that the model attempted to fulfill the user's instructions. As such, Objective 3 cannot be successfully achieved."
23,Check the historical records or current status for the CNPJ '99.888.777/0001-33'?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls were empty (`[]`).  
- There were no actual tool calls invoked by the model (`'tool_calls': None` for all entries).  
- Since no tools were needed and none were called, it meets the expectations set by the required API calls, resulting in a success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model did not provide a final answer fulfilling a user-focused instruction, as seen in the data (`'give_answer'` never appeared and no relevant information was retrieved or synthesized).  
- Consequently, the required user instruction was not achieved, leading to a failure for Objective 3."
24,Provide the company name and address associated with the CNPJ number '99.888.777/0001-33'?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list, which means there were no required API calls for this task. The model invoked only the `Finish` tool, which is allowable since no tool calls were mandated. This matches the expectations, so Objective 2 is successful.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer based on completing the user's instruction (since it chose to ""give up and restart""), and no ""give_answer"" information was presented. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
25,Provide me with French subtitles for the video with the ID 'Wrald_EZgDQ'?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, no tool calls were expected, and indeed, none were invoked by the model since `""tool_calls"": None` is present throughout. This aligns with the required API calls `[ ]`. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  
For Objective 3, the model does not provide any final answer for the user's instruction, as there are no `'return_type': 'give_answer'` fields or corresponding final answers in the provided output. Consequently, Objective 3 is a failure."
26,Get subtitles for a Vimeo video with the ID '12345abc'?,1258,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**: The required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), meaning the model is not expected to invoke any tools. In the interactions logged above, one unnecessary tool was called (`Finish` with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`). However, this is permissible as additional tool calls that don't align with the requirement are allowed. Since the model completed the task with no required tools missing for Objective 2 criteria, it is a **success for Objective 2**.

**Objective 3**: The model must either deliver the user-requested final answer or provide meaningful information as a result of tool calls. It neither produced a purpose-driven/task-oriented answer nor reached a conclusion directly aligned with any user requests. Instead, the system invoked the `Finish` tool indicating it gave up and eventually provided repetitive declarative responses unrelated to progress?îthe criterion of delivering a clear and targetable output from either necessary or recomposing data after its experiment interaction traced like that.."
27,"Calculate my age if I provide my date of birth in the format DD/MM/YYYY, such as '28/02/1997'?",3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- For Objective 2: There are no required API calls to invoke, as specified by the empty list (`[]`). The model's behavior in invoking or not invoking tool calls, therefore, automatically fulfills the requirements. The actual tool call used is unrelated to any required tool calls, meaning this is a success.  
- For Objective 3: The model provided a valid final answer using the `Finish` function, fulfilling the user's instruction interpreted as a conversational interaction (`Hello! How can I help you today?`). As the final answer was generated and marked completed successfully, this satisfies Objective 3."
28,Tell me the age difference in years and months between two people born on '19970228' and '19870630'?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are empty (`[]`), and the actual tool invocation is relevant (`Finish` with `{'return_type': 'give_up_and_restart'}`). There are no mismatches because no specific API calls were expected, even though an additional tool was invoked. Thus, the objective is considered successful.  
- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer involving ""final_answer"". Thus, it fails to fulfill the user's instruction."
29,Get a list of all subscribers to a specific YouTube channel?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, there were no required API calls indicated as the expected API calls (`[]`). The model did not invoke any tools (as evidenced by missing tool_calls), which is consistent with the requirements. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
For Objective 3, there is no final answer present in the response dict (`'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': ...` is not in the given conversation trace). Hence, the user?ôs instruction was not fulfilled, so Objective 3 is a failure."
30,Upload a video to YouTube ,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty `[]`, meaning no tools were required to be invoked. The actual tool calls by the model were also absent `None`, successfully satisfying this condition. Hence Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the model fails because no final answer was provided. Specifically, the model's outputs provide several conversational assistant responses but do not fulfill the user's instruction or attempt to answer the YouTube video uploading request. Furthermore, without attempting any tool use that aligns with solving the user's requirements, the task was left incomplete, resulting in a failure for Objective 3."
31,Follow or unfollow a user with ID '987654321',1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, there were no required API calls (`[]`), and the model invoked the tool `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which did not conflict with any requirements because none existed. Hence, the model achieved Objective 2 successfully.  

For Objective 3, the model's response (""chose to give up and restart"") fails to provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction because no meaningful final response was offered. Furthermore, no final response meeting the user's directives was generated. Since no final answer was achieved, Objective 3 fails."
32,Retrieve the profile pictures of a a user with ID '987654321' followers,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are empty (`[]`), implying that no tool calls are needed. Since there are no tool calls invoked by the model either (`'tool_calls': None`), this aligns perfectly with the requirements. Therefore, Objective 2 is considered a success.  

For Objective 3, the model fails to provide a final answer. This is evident as there is no `'return_type': 'give_answer'` or `'final_answer'` field in the dataset. Consequently, Objective 3 is a failure."
33,"Get analytics data for my channel 'gmhikaru', such as viewer count or engagement metrics?'",1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: There were **no required API calls** given in the task (empty required API call list). Since the model did not invoke any tools (verified by the absence of `tool_calls` in the input), it meets the empty requirement and thus passes Objective 2. However, under Objective 3, **the model failed to provide a final answer to the user's instruction**, as no `'give_answer'` type with a `'final_answer'` key is present in the dataset."
34,Ban  a user 'KMLT96' from my channel 'gmhikaru''s chat ,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty, meaning no API calls were expected. The model invoked a tool call ('Finish'), which is allowed because any additional tools, whether necessary or not, do not affect the outcome of this objective. Therefore, this evaluation results in success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model chose ""give up and restart"" and did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Since no final answer was given, this constitutes a failure for Objective 3."
35,How old is the domain 'example.com' ,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the expected API calls are none (`[]`), implying there are no specific tool calls required. The tool call made by the model is `Finish` with the arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is irrelevant and unnecessary but does not conflict with the requirement since no particular tool calls are expected. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  
- For Objective 3, the model chose to give up and restart, as communicated via the response of the invoked tool `Finish`. Since no final answer satisfying the user's instruction was provided, Objective 3 is a failure."
36,What is the SPF record for 'example.com' ,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty. The actual tool call invoked by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`. Since there are no required API calls, the condition is met, resulting in a success for Objective 2.  
- For Objective 3, there is no `""give_answer""` or final answer provided by the model. Thus, the model has failed to fulfill the user's instruction, resulting in a failure for Objective 3."
37,Provide the ownership history for the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9' ,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are an empty list `[]`, meaning no tool invocations were necessary. The model made an invocation of the ""Finish"" tool with argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is extraneous but acceptable, as the absence of required API calls makes this fulfillment valid. Since all required tool calls were invoked (and no requirement existed in this case), this is marked as **Success**.  

For Objective 3:  
The user's instruction requires a final answer to evaluate whether the goal was fulfilled. The model only indicated ""chose to give up and restart"" indirectly through its invoked tool and did not provide a clear final answer. As a result, the user's instruction result wasn't achieved and **Objective 3 is marked as Failure**."
38, What is the service and repair history of the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9'?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, there are no required API calls in the task ('required API calls': []). The actual tool calls were also `None`. Therefore, the model fulfilled the requirement by appropriately not invoking any tools, and Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide any final answer (i.e., no evidence of output indicating 'give_answer' or an attempted final response). Consequently, the user's instruction was not achieved, leading to a failure for Objective 3."
39,Show me all the completed/incomplete todo list items?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are empty (`[]`), and the model also made the call to 'Finish', which is unnecessary and does not affect the requirement. Since all of the expected tool calls are trivially satisfied, Objective 2 is a success.  
For Objective 3, no final answer was provided by the model (since there is no `'final_answer'` present in the provided response structure). As a result, Objective 3 is a failure."
40,Mark the todo list item with ID 5 as completed?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls list was empty (`[]`).  
- The tools invoked by the model included a single tool call: `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since there were no required API calls, the model fulfilled this condition.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model did not provide a final answer, as no `""final_answer""` is present in the evaluated output. Instead, the tool response indicates it ""chose to give up and restart."" Hence, it fails to fulfill the user's instruction."
41,Provide me with arrest records from 2010 for 'az-mcso'.,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list, meaning no API calls were needed or expected. The tool calls invoked by the model are also absent (no tools invoked), which meets the expectation. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.   
For Objective 3, the model did not provide any final answer because there is no final answer marked with a return_type of ""give_answer"" and corresponding ""final_answer"". Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
42,Give me the court case outcomes for individuals arrested by 'az-mcso'.,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, there were no required API calls, as indicated by the empty array. The model is allowed to make additional and unnecessary tool calls. The model invoked the tool `Finish` with the appropriate arguments, and this did not contradict any lack of required tool calls, meaning Objective 2 is a success.  
For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer'` was not found). Hence, the model fails to fulfill Objective 3."
43,How many people are currently watching the show with title ID 80057281?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, as the required API calls list is empty (`[]`), there are no tool calls mandated for this evaluation. Since no tool calls are made by the model in the input provided, it satisfies the condition of invoking all required (in this case, no) API calls. Thus, Objective 2 is deemed a success. For Objective 3, the model does not produce a final answer in the provided content; it instead shows messages related to assistance but does not fulfill any specific user instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 fails."

Since no API calls were required, the model satisfies this aspect by not calling any necessary tools, and the additional tool invocation does not impact this success.  
For Objective 3, the model fails because it chose to ""give up and restart"" without completing the user's request or providing a final answer to fulfill the instruction. Therefore, the user's instruction was not achieved."
45,"How many users are currently online on mycompanywebsite.com, and where are they from?",1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls were empty (`[]`), which means the model did not need to make any tool calls. Since there were no tool calls made by the model (`tool_calls = None` for all cases), it aligns perfectly with the requirements. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, there was no final answer provided by the model (`give_answer` did not appear in the outputs). As per the given guidelines, absence of a final answer leads to a direct failure for Objective 3."
46,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The required API calls are empty (`[]`), and no tool calls are invoked by the model, which satisfies the requirements. Hence, Objective 2 is successful.  
- **Objective 3:** The model fails to provide a final answer to the user's request regarding sentiment analysis of show ID `80057281`. There is no concluding response or satisfaction of the user's instruction, which makes Objective 3 a failure."
47,List all friends of the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty, meaning there are no expected tool calls. Similarly, no tool calls were made by the model in the provided data (""tool_calls"": None for all interactions). Therefore, the model fulfills this requirement accurately, marking a success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3: The model did not provide any final answer to the user's instruction, evident from the absence of the ""give_answer"" key in the provided data and its inability to address the user's intent as described (only giving generic responses or disclaimers). Consequently, it fails to fulfill the user's requirements under this objective."
48,Fetch the latest notifications for the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are an empty list: `[]`, meaning no API call is needed.  
- The model did not invoke any tool calls (as indicated by `'tool_calls': None` in all instances), which matches the required behavior.  
- Therefore, Objective 2 is a success as no tool call is expected or required, and the model correctly did not invoke any tools.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model did not provide a final answer (there is no entry with `'return_type': 'give_answer'` and `'final_answer'`).  
- According to the instructions, if no final answer is provided, Objective 3 automatically fails.  
- Consequently, Objective 3 is a failure."
49,I'm concerned about the whether this ip address is accessible. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is accessible?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, there are no required API calls in the given set, and the submitted tool calls include a call to `Finish` with the `arguments` being `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since there were no required tool calls to compare and fulfill, the model fulfills any expectations provided (none in this case). Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, instead using the `Finish` tool and effectively giving up. As the user instruction is not satisfied, Objective 3 is marked as a failure."
50,"I'm a music lover, can you help me find the billboard top 100 songs for this week?",1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), which means no tools were expected to be invoked as part of the requirement. Reviewing the invoked/discussed tools in the data above, no tools were called by the model (`""tool_calls"": None` in every entry). Hence, the model meets the requirement for Objective 2, making it a success.  
- For Objective 3: Since the model does not provide any final answer (`return_type` of type `'give_answer'` with a `'final_answer'` is not present in the data), it fails to meet Objective 3. Consequently, it does not achieve or fulfill the user's instruction or request."
