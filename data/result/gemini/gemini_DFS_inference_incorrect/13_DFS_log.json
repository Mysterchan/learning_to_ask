If so, what is the maximum number of suggested videos you would like me to retrieve and process before returning the results?\n",

This approach might provide more robust results.  I will then retrieve details and comments for a limited number of search results.\n\nI will limit the number of search results to 3 to avoid overwhelming the API and ensure I can retrieve comments and details within reasonable time.\n\nMy next action will be to use `search_for_youtube_v3_v2` to find similar videos.\n",
