1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool call was:  
```  
{'name': 'search_for_netflix_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""\n }'}  
```  
The actual tool calls by the model included:   
1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `'{""limit_titles"":1,""query"":""The Matrix""}'` - **Mismatch in the query argument**: ""The Matrix"" is different from ""The Matrix Revolutions"".  

Additionally, the model invoked two unnecessary `'Finish'` calls, which were not required. However, those unnecessary calls have no impact on the expected success results for **Objective 2**, as only ""required"" tools are assessed.  

As the query does not match semantically or exactly as per the required tool call, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

For **Objective 3**, since the model did not provide the final answer to fulfill the user's instruction (specifically chose to ""give up and restart""), plus Objective 2 has already failed (thus leaving unretrieved or misleading information), we can conclude that **Objective 3 is also a failure.**"
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',1161,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**: 

- **Objective 2**:  
   - The model invoked the tool `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the arguments `{""limit_titles"":1,""query"":""star wars""}`.  
   - The required API call is `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the arguments `{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}`.  
   - The tool name is correct; however, the argument `""query""` does not match. The model used `""star wars""` as the query string, which is more general and could lead to different data being fetched. The required API call was supposed to focus specifically on the movie `'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'`.  
   - Since the arguments are not equivalent, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**:  
   - Based on the rules, a failure in Objective 2 directly leads to a failure in Objective 3.  
   - Additionally, the model did not provide a valid answer based on the retrieved API data. Instead, it stated that the search result was not specific enough and proposed trying again with a more specific search. Ultimately, no response was provided that fulfilled the user's requirement, and no final output (""give answer"") was made either."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",920,Success,Failure,Failure,"`{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{ ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023"" }'}`  

The model invoked the following tools:  
- Multiple repetitions of:  
  `{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{""date1"":""12-01-2022"",""date2"":""12-31-2022""}'}`  

Even though the tool is correct (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`), the `arguments` do not match. The model used the dates `""12-01-2022""` and `""12-31-2022""`, while the required arguments specify `""12-01-2023""` and `""12-31-2023""`. Because of this discrepancy in the `arguments`, Objective 2 is a failure.

---

**Objective 3:** **Failure**  
**Reason:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. Moreover, the model's answers indicate that the response was based on incorrect API calls (wrong date range), meaning the user's instruction to get the 2023 data was not fulfilled. Consequently, Objective 3 fails as well."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,969,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the actual invoked tool calls include two calls to `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with the argument `{ ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"" }`, which matches the required API call `{ ""name"": ""search_countries_timezone_for_geography"", ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""timezone\"": \""UTC+03:00\""\n }"" }`. Therefore, the objective is a success.  
For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction but responded with incomplete requests for more information and returned irrelevant interactions. Thus, the objective is a failure."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,1161,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
- **Actual Tool Calls Made by the Model:**  
  1. `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}'`  
  2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`  

- **Required Tool Calls:**  
  1. `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{\n  ""date"": ""2022-12-18""\n }'`  

Comparison:  
The required tool call was correctly invoked by the model. The tool name matches (`'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'`), and the argument value for `""date"": ""2022-12-18""` is correct. The second tool call (`'Finish'`) is irrelevant to the requirement for success, as Objective 2 only checks whether all the required API calls were invoked, and extraneous tool calls do not affect the outcome. Hence, Objective 2 is marked a **success**.

---

**Objective 3:**  
The user?ôs task was unclear but seems heavily related to obtaining scores for the specified date (`""2022-12-18""`). While the model successfully invoked the correct API call (`get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api`), it marked the result of this as ""give_up_and_restart"" (via the `'Finish'` tool). Furthermore, no **final answer** was provided to the user ??the model internally deliberated on providing additional steps and responses but never returned the answer requested by the task.  

Therefore, as the absence of a final answer constitutes a failure in fulfilling the user's intent, Objective 3 is marked as **failure**."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",1205,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The model was required to invoke:   
`search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""teaching in London"" }`.  

However, the model actually invoked:   
1. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`   
2. `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""employment_types"":""FULLTIME"",""page"":1,""query"":""professional jobs in New York""}`  

Although the correct API tool name `search_for_jsearch` was invoked, its arguments do not match the required API call. The argument for `query` is `""professional jobs in New York""` instead of the required `""teaching in London""`. Therefore, the tool call does not align with the expected API call, and Objective 2 fails.  

**Objective 3**:  
Because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails directly, as the required API data was neither retrieved nor used to formulate a final response consistent with the user instruction. Furthermore, the system ultimately did not provide a final answer fulfilling the user?ôs instruction about finding jobs related to teaching in London."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,292,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call is:  
`'search_for_jsearch' with arguments '{ ""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York"" }'`,  
but the actual tools invoked by the model all used the argument:  
`query: ""engineering jobs in New York""`. The argument is fundamentally different because ""machanical engineer"" job and generic ""engineering jobs"" are not semantically the same; the required API call is specifically about ""machanical engineer"", making the API calls made by the model incorrect. Moreover, there are multiple redundant calls to the tool as well with slight variations (""num_pages"", for example), but they are irrelevant since the main requirement of matching the expected arguments is unmet.

For Objective 3: As the Objective 2 was not met, the required data for the user's request (""machanical engineer in New York"") was never retrieved properly. Moreover, the final answer provided (`Here's a list of engineering jobs in New York ?¶`) is based on retrieved job listings for the incorrect broader query of ""engineering jobs in New York."" Thus, the final answer fails to fulfill the user's original instruction accurately and makes use of the incorrect API call results. This constitutes a failure for Objective 3."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",725,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls were [`search_for_transfermarket` with `{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}` and `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with `{""is_id"": 3140}`]. The actual tool calls made by the model included multiple requests for `search_for_transfermarket` with `{""query"": ""ronaldo""}` as well as another call with `{""query"": ""Cristiano Ronaldo""}`. Although these variations seem aligned in meaning with intent (`""query"": ""ronaldo"" ??""query"": ""Ronaldo""`), the second required API (`players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with `{""is_id"": 3140}`) was never called. Thus, one required tool invocation was missing, resulting in a failure for Objective 2. 

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed due to incomplete tool calls (the player profile API call is essential), the user's instruction could not have been fulfilled completely, making the final answer generated by the model invalid and failing this objective as well. While the model's final answer did refer to Cristiano Ronaldo and provided a valid profile, it explicitly only worked from an undeclared player ID (`8198`) instead of performing the necessary call from the defined expected workflow (`is_id: 3140`).

9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",1065,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**
- The required API call is `{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{\n  ""job_title"": ""software developer"",\n  ""location"": ""New York""\n }'}`.
- The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  1. `'search_filters_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""country"":""us"",""query"":""professional jobs in New York""}'`.  
  2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`.  
  3. `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""num_pages"":""1"",""query"":""entry-level professional jobs in New York""}'`.  
- The required API call `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` was not invoked. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  
- Since the required tool was not called, the final output cannot fulfill the user's request, and no final answer based on the API output was provided. Thus, **Objective 3 is also a failure**."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",920,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Comparison**: 
- **Expected API Call**: `'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search'` with arguments `{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}`.
- **Model's Actual Tool Calls**:  
  - `{ ""name"": ""search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search"", ""arguments"": '{""query"":""Star Wars""}' },` (and repeated multiple times however equivalent).  

The `query` argument in the model's calls is `""Star Wars""`, which does not match the expected specific argument of `""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""`. The difference in the query argument is a semantic deviation, affecting the API's capability to precisely retrieve the user's requested information. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

**Objective 3 Assessment**:  
Since Objective 2 failed, the API call did not meet the requirement to fetch specific data (`Star Wars: Return of the Jedi`). As a direct result, the model could not produce a valid final answer. Additionally, the data (tool responses) it claims were insufficient for proceeding with specific next steps, and no proper final answer was generated because of this. Hence, **Objective 3 is also a failure**."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
The required API call was:  
`get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`  

The actual tool call invoked by the model was:  
`get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-07-26""}`  

The tool's name is correct; however, the required argument `""date"": ""2024-01-15""` does not match the actual argument `""date"": ""2022-07-26""`. Since the arguments do not align, this results in failure for Objective 2.  

As stated earlier, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. No valid final answer was provided that effectively used the API call to fulfill the user's request. Therefore, both objectives have failed."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,5,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
`'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments:  
`'{\n  ""season"": ""2020""\n }'`.  

The tools invoked by the model include two calls to `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'`:  
1. The first one with arguments: `'{""season"":""covid""}'`.  
2. The second one with arguments: `'{""season"":""2020""}'`.  

The initial attempt by the model failed with an invalid season, but it subsequently attempted the correct call expected:  
`'{""season"":""2020""}'`.  

Thus, the required API call was invoked successfully, even with an additional incorrect attempt made earlier. Based on the guidance that additional unnecessary attempts are acceptable as long as the required tool call is made, objective 1 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model was:  
`""The projected PGA rankings for the 2020 season are currently unavailable. The API returned an empty rankings list.""`.  

The answer aligns with the data retrieved through the API call and clearly fulfills the user instruction regarding projected PGA rankings for the 2020 season. Therefore, objective 2 is also a success."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
```
'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with arguments '{ ""tournament_id"": ""650"" }'
```  
The actual tool call made by the model is:  
```
'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with arguments '{""tournament_id"":12345}'
```  
The tool name matches ('leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data') but the required argument value for `tournament_id` is ""650"", whereas the model used ""12345"". As the provided argument differs and is not semantically close, this results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we automatically infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it gave up and restarted without attempting the correct API calls to retrieve the necessary data required to produce the final answer."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the actual tool used by the model was `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis` twice, with arguments `'{""category"":""singles"",""n_players"":""10"",""timestamp"":""2024-02-26""}'`, but the required API call had arguments `'{""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""}'`. The `timestamp` in the actual call (`2024-02-26`) does not match the required `timestamp` (`2025-01-20`). This mismatch causes the failure in Objective 2. Even though the tool name matches, the required argument for `timestamp` is wrong, leading to a failure.  

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails because the data for the final answer wouldn't have been retrieved using the required API call. Furthermore, the model gives a final answer `'Top 10 ATP Singles Rankings as of 2024-02-26'], which is based on the incorrect `timestamp`, so the user's instruction to retrieve data specific to the required date (`2025-01-20`) is not met."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,1061,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
   Required API Tool Call:  
   - `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments `{ ""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }`

   Actual API Tool Calls made by the model:  
   1. `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments `{""category"": ""returnpointswon1stserve"", ""season"": ""2012"", ""surface"": ""clay""}`
   2. `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments `{""category"": ""returnpointswon2ndserve"", ""season"": ""2012"", ""surface"": ""clay""}`
   3. `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments `{""category"": ""returnpointswon"", ""season"": ""2012"", ""surface"": ""clay""}`
   
   Evaluation:   
   None of the tool calls match the expected `category` argument value `""return""`. The `category` in all invoked tools specifies different values (`""returnpointswon1stserve""`, `""returnpointswon2ndserve""`, and `""returnpointswon""`), none of which align with the required `""return""`. Due to this mismatch, Objective 2 is marked as **failed**.

- **Objective 3:**  
   As Objective 2 has failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also **failed**. Additionally:  
   - The model does not provide a valid, conclusive ""final_answer"" that fulfills the user's instruction based on accurate API-derived data. Furthermore, since multiple tool calls failed, nor did they meet the required `category`, the user request was not achieved at all."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**: The expected tool call is `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`, but the actual tool call made by the model is `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"":""CNY"",""int"":""100"",""to"":""GBP""}`. 

    - The ""base"" argument in the required tool call is ""RMB"", but in the actual tool call, it is ""CNY"". While RMB and CNY refer to the same currency in practice (Chinese Yuan), strict evaluation and mismatch of exact values cause failure.
    - The actual tool call includes an unexpected argument `""int"":""100""`, which is acceptable under the Guidance for Objective 2 if everything else matched. However, the inconsistency in matching `""base""` argument results in failure.
    
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure due to incorrect tool usage, Objective 3 automatically fails because the final answer cannot be trusted as derived from the correct API data.

17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
`{'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""\n   }'}`  

The model did not invoke any tool calls (indicated by the presence of `'tool_calls': None` throughout the interactions). Since the required API call was not made, this results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, since the model failed to make the necessary tool calls to retrieve the required information and no final answer is provided (no `'return_type': 'give_answer'` was supplied), it also fails to meet the user's request, resulting in a failure for this objective."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The actual tools invoked by the model were:  
  1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"":""TASLA""}`.  
  2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`.  

  The required API calls were:  
  1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`.  
  2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`.  
  3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`.  

  - The attempt to invoke `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` failed because it used an incorrect `symbol` (""TASLA"") rather than the required ""TSLA"".  
  - The model did not invoke the required tool `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2`.
  
  Due to these issues, **Objective 2** failed.  

- **Objective 3**:  
 If Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails based on the rules. Additionally, the final answer notes an incomplete fulfilment of the user's requirements, as it acknowledges the failure to retrieve ""index trend history"" and ""institution ownership details,"" demonstrating that the user's instructions weren't met.

19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",1145,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**   
   - Required API calls:  
     - `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`

     - `Finish` invoked twice with `""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""`  
     - `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""Janover""}`  

   - Comparison:  
     The actual tool calls did not align with the required API calls. The tool `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` was called, but the `symbol` argument provided (`""Janover""`) does not match the required `""JNVR""`. Additionally, the remaining required tools (`stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` and `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2`) were entirely absent in the actual API calls made by the model. Overall, this mismatch and missing calls result in a failure for Objective 2.

2. **Objective 3**  
   - The final answer provided by the model fails to meet the user's instruction because the user requested specific API data for the stock with the ticker ""JNVR"", which was not retrieved. The model assumed the ticker symbol ""Janover"" and acted upon this incorrect input multiple times, ultimately indicating the need for further user input without extracting the relevant data from the APIs. Furthermore, no valid answer based on any expected API data was generated.  

Given that the actual API calls did not align with the expected calls (Objective 2 failure) and the final response did not fulfill the user's request or rely on required APIs, Objective 3 also fails."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:

The actual invoked tool call is:  
`'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"":""FB""}'`  

Though the function name matches (`stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`), the argument value differs. The expected symbol is `""META""`, but the actual symbol used is `""FB""`, which is incorrect. Thus, the model fails to make an accurate API call.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 fails automatically as we cannot rely on or validate the data acquired.

**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the model inaccurately invoked the tool call with the wrong argument value (`""FB""` instead of `""META""`). As Objective 2 fails, the user's instruction couldn't be achieved, leading to the failure of Objective 3."

Since the channels differ semantically (shadoune666 versus shadoune kane), this does not satisfy the required API specifications. As Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically deemed a failure due to the incorrect usage of the requisite API call, directly impacting the model's final ability to retrieve the desired information or answer the user input correctly."

`'{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}'`.  

However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model in this instance do not match the expected API call. Instead, the model invoked:  
1. `'name': 'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments:  
`'{""username"":""MrBeast""}'`.  

2. Additionally, it invoked `'name': 'Finish'` for giving the final answer.  

The expected tool call (`video_details_for_tiktok_api`) was neither invoked, nor was any argument pertaining to ""video_id"" in the format `""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""` included. Since the required API call was entirely missed, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model does not align with the correct process, as it relied on the API calls it performed (`user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api` and `'Finish'`), which were not the required or pertinent steps to gather information about the ""video_details_for_tiktok_api"" as specified in the prompt. Furthermore, as Objective 2 is a failure, **Objective 3 automatically fails** because it indicates that the necessary API call was not made to achieve the correct response."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For Objective 2, the required API call specifies the function `'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes'` with the arguments including `""symbol"": ""ESTC""`, `""interval"": ""4hour""`, `""from"": ""2024-01-01""`, and `""to"": ""2024-12-30""`. The actual tool calls made by the model invoked this same function with arguments like `""symbol"": ""ESTC""` and `""interval"": ""4hour""` but failed to include the required `""from""` and `""to""` date range parameters. Therefore, the model's tool calls do not meet the necessary conditions, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model never provided a valid final answer fulfilling the user's request for Elastic's historical stock prices for the specified date range. The repeated output of the assistant was a request for the stock symbol, even though the symbol (""ESTC"") was clearly provided in both the requirement and actual calls (problem specific to a possible state tracking issue of inputs). Furthermore, since Objective 2 was a failure, it directly implies Objective 3 is a failure as well. Therefore, the model failed to effectively retrieve and deliver the required data."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,969,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Actual tool calls by the model:** Various uses of `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` in the function logs. Examples include:  
  - `""arguments"": {""base"":""USDT"",""gran"":""1d"",""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""symbol"":""BTC""}`
  - `""arguments"": {""base"":""USDT"",""gran"":""1h"",""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""symbol"":""BTC""}`
  - `""arguments"": {""base"":""USDT"",""end"":""2023-05-12T10:05:00"",""gran"":""15m"",""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""symbol"":""BTC""}`
  
- **Required tool call as stated:**
  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data"",
    ""arguments"": ""{
      \""market_venue\"": \""BINANCE\"",
      \""start\"": \""2023-05-05T10:05:00\"",
      \""base\"": \""USDT\"",
      \""symbol\"": \""BTC\""
    }""
  }
  ```
  Observations:  
  - There is a discrepancy between the **required tool name** and **actual tool name** invoked by the model. The required API name is given as `ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`, while the model invoked `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` in all its calls. This mismatch, despite being potentially minor in spelling, results in a **failure** as strict precision in names is required.  
  - Although certain actual calls by the model may have arguments closely matching or semantically aligning with the required arguments (`market_venue`, `start`, `base`, `symbol`) to access ""Binance BTC data starting on 2023-05-05T10:05:00,"" the concern about **correct tool identification takes precedence.**

For Objective 3:  
- Since Objective 2 failed, it can be directly inferred that the model's response failed to meet Objective 3 as well. It is invalidated at the outset owing to the incorrect or unsuccessful invocation of the required tool. Moreover, the model does **not generate a final answer made available in the expected `""give_answer""` output** in the evaluated traces. Final actionable output consolidating data-based evidence from successfully retrieved API output is missing, ensuring failure too."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected API calls were:  
1. tool name: `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with the parameters `{ ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"" }`  
2. tool name: `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with the parameters `{ ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT"" }`.  

The model, however, made the following tool calls:  
1. tool name: `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with parameters `{ ""base"":""USD"", ""start_date"":""2023-07-26"", ""end_date"":""2024-07-26"", ""symbols"":""XAU"" }`.  
This differs from the expected calls, as:  
   - The `start_date` and `end_date` are incorrectly set to ""2023-07-26"" and ""2024-07-26"" instead of within the required time range, ""2022-12-01"" to ""2022-12-20"".
   - The expected second API call for ""XPT"" was never attempted.

For Objective 3, failure is directly inferred because the model did not successfully call the required tools or retrieve accurate API data, and no meaningful final answer was given to satisfy the user's request."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",1145,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls include:  
1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`  
2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`  
3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`.  

However, the model made the following tool calls:  
1. Invoked `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"":""Silynxcom Ltd.""}'`.  
2. Invoked `'stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"":""SILY""}'`.  
3. Called the `'Finish'` function multiple times with `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`.  

From this, we note: 
A. The `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` API call does not match the required format, as the called argument values (`""symbol"":""Silynxcom Ltd.""`) differ from the required value (`""symbol"":""SYNX""`).  
B. The required API calls for `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` and `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with `""symbol"":""SYNX""` were not invoked at all.  

Hence, none of the required API calls were correctly satisfied, making this a failure for Objective 2.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed due to the API tool calls not matching the required ones, the final answer?îitself reliant on successful API call data?îcould not have been obtained. The output included multiple instances of `'Finish'` with responses indicating failure to proceed due to a lack of the proper stock ticker symbol for ""Silynxcom Ltd."" Thus, it is clear that that the user?ôs request (gathering stock index trends, balance sheet data, and institutional ownership for the ticker ""SYNX"") was not fulfilled.  Furthermore, despite numerous re-attempts, there was no final answer that accomplished this, resulting in a failure for Objective 3 as well."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls were as follows:  
1. 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with arguments '{ ""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"" }'

However, the model invoked only one tool:  
1. 'historical_rates_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with arguments '{""base"":""USD"",""date"":""2024-01-22"",""symbols"":""XAU,XPT""}'.  

The tool invoked by the model is incorrect in terms of both the tool name and the corresponding arguments when compared to the required API calls. The name does not match ('time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' vs. 'historical_rates_for_metals_prices_rates_api'), and the arguments are misaligned (e.g., incorrect date ""2024-01-22"", missing ""start_date"" and ""end_date"", and merging of ""symbols""). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since the final answer provided by the model must arise from accurate tool usage, and given that Objective 2 failed (incorrect tool calls leading to irrelevant data generation), we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails because the user's requirements were not achieved. The given final answer is not based on the required API calls."

Furthermore, the model did not deliver a final answer based on any API-driven data or logic that satisfies the instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,8,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
   - **Actual Tools Invoked**:

     - `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments: `'{""date"":""08-07-2024""}'`
     - `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments: `'{""date"":""08-06-2024""}'`
     - Additionally, the tool `'Finish'` was invoked multiple times, but this tool is unnecessary and unrelated to the required API calls.
   - **Expected Tool Call**:
     - `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments: `'{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}'`
   - **Evaluation**: None of the `drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5` tool calls made by the model matched the expected date parameter (`""01-02-2024""`), making Objective 2 a failure.

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
   - Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure as the required tool call was not successfully executed to fulfill the task. Importantly, the model did not produce a valid final answer to the user's request. Instead, the unnecessary `'Finish'` tool invocation indicates the model gave up, renouncing retrieval of the required data."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2**: The required API call is `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`. However, the actual API calls made by the model are:  
    - `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""07-01-2024"", ""date2"": ""07-31-2024""}`.  
    These arguments (`""07-01-2024""` to `""07-31-2024""`) do not match the required ones (`""12-01-2023""` to `""12-31-2023""`). Despite making multiple API calls to this function, it never uses the required arguments. Additionally, the multiple unnecessary calls to `Finish` further suggest a failure. Since at least one required call was not correct as specified, Objective 2 fails.  

2. **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 already fails (indicating the required data was not retrieved correctly), Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure as well. Moreover, the model does not present any final answer to fulfill the user's instructions, cementing the failure for Objective 3."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,1257,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, no tools were invoked by the model (`'tool_calls': None` throughout); hence the required API call `'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""variables"": """", ""values"": """", ""expression"": ""5+10""}` was not made. Without the correct tool call, this is a clear failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since no relevant tools were called, the model could not use the data necessary to fulfill the user's request. Additionally, there is no `""final_answer""` provided in the input, indicating that the user?ôs instruction was not achieved. Per the rule, if Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 directly fails as well."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with the arguments `'{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}'`. However, the model invoked the `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` function with arguments `'{""username"":""Michael Lee""}'`, which does not match the required function name, nor does it match the arguments format or intention of the expected call. The incorrect tool invocation led to failure to achieve the required Objective 2. Additionally, no attempt was made to invoke the expected `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` function.  

For Objective 3, since no valid data was retrieved through any API call, no meaningful fulfillment of the user's instructions was achieved. Moreover, while the model provided extensive rationale for its attempts, the execution did not depend on valid API responses or related data. Hence, this objective also fails."

     - `""best US islands for vacation""`
     - `""best US beach vacation destinations""`, etc.
   - `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` was *never invoked*.
2. This set does not satisfy the required tool calls because:

     - `{'name': 'search_web_for_google_search_json', 'arguments': '{ ""q"": ""\'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island\'"" }'}`
   - The required API workflows expected targeted queries specific to ""images of the beaches"" or ""daily weather forecasts"" explicitly focused on Hawaii Island. The invoked queries either failed to meet specificity or aimed at irrelevant tasks. Furthermore, **no categorized beach-related image gateway/system align w/p-call (whether finish frontier points reliably hold missen!).

Required API Call:
- Tool Name: `search_for_g_search`

Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model:  
1. `search_for_g_search` with arguments: `{""q"": ""most romantic city in Europe""}`

4. `Finish` with arguments: `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  
5. `Finish` with arguments: `{""final_answer"":""Here are some highly-rated restaurants in Venice...?ù}`  

Comparison to Required API Call:  
The required API call explicitly requests a query for ""popular restaurants in Paris."" However, the model failed to make this call. Instead, the tool calls were targeted toward queries like ""most romantic city in Europe"" and ""best romantic cities in europe rankings"" or refined searches for Venice rather than Paris. This deviation means the required tool has not been called as specified.

Objective 2 thus fails due to unmet expectations for the required API call. As per the evaluation guidelines, an Objective 2 failure automatically results in Objective 3 failure. The final response also attempts to simulate results for Venice instead of Paris, further confirming that Objective 3 was not achieved."

Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- Expected tool calls:  
  - `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""NG"" }`  
  - `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""NG"" }`  
- Actual tool calls made by the model:  
  - `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""EG""}`  

The invoked tool name `country_details_for_referential_db` partially matches with the required one (ignoring capitalization differences in arguments), but the value of the argument `countrycode` is `""EG""` which does not align with the expected value `""NG""`. Furthermore, the second required API call (`states_for_referential_db`) was not invoked by the model at all.  

Hence, the model failed to meet the requirements for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Because Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model (referencing Egypt instead of Nigeria) shows that it failed to achieve the user's instruction based on the correct API call data. The mismatch in data and missing API calls invalidates the final response."

Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The required API calls are:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`  
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`  

  Actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""MD""}`  

  The first tool call by the model, `'country_details_for_referential_db'`, contains a mismatch in the argument: the expected value for `countryCode` is `""UA""`, but the model used `""MD""`. Moreover, the second required API call, `'states_for_referential_db'`, was not invoked. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is an automatic **failure**, and additionally, it's clear that the model's final answer gives details about ""Moldova"" instead of the required input of ""Ukraine"" (`""UA""`), failing to meet the user's instruction. The final answer fundamentally does not retrieve and intentionally use any relevant data from the required API calls."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency?

The model invoked the correct tool name `'country_details_for_referential_db'`, but the argument `""countrycode"": ""??""` does not match the required argument `""countryCode"": ""MY""`. This discrepancy in the argument makes the tool invocation incorrect. Additionally, the required call for `'states_for_referential_db'` was not made.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since **Objective 2** failed due to incomplete and incorrect API calls, the data required to fulfill the user?ôs instruction could not be gathered. Additionally, there is no final answer in the provided data indicating how the model resolved the user's request. This results in failure for **Objective 3** as well."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency?

  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""IND""}`

  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  

- **Comparison Reasoning:**  
  - The first required tool `'country_details_for_referential_db'` was invoked by the model with an incorrect argument key: Instead of `""countryCode"": ""IN""`, the argument was provided as `""countrycode"":""IND""`. This is a case-sensitive mismatch in argument spelling and an additional issue of using a full country name (""IND"" instead of the expected code ""IN""). Therefore, this tool did not fulfill the requirement.  
  - The second required tool `'states_for_referential_db'` was not invoked at all.  
  - Although an additional tool (`'Finish'`) was unnecessarily invoked, it does not affect the evaluation, as additional tool calls are allowed. However, since all required tool calls were not correctly made, Objective 2 is a failure.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also directly inferred as a failure. However, evaluating further:  
- The final user instruction (retrieve details and states of the most populous unvisited country) was not achieved, as the final answer did not provide the required information. Additionally, the model chose to ""give up and restart"" rather than deriving the response based on API calls.
- No valid final answer fulfilling the instruction was present in the flow."

- **Actual Tool Calls**: **There were no actual tool calls by the model.**  

Upon evaluation, the model completely failed to invoke the required tool `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'`. Since no tool calls were made at all, the requirement for objective 1 was not fulfilled.

### Objective 3: Failure  
If Objective 2 is a failure, we can infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover:  
- The model has not made the expected API call.
- The model did not process any relevant external data source, and hence could not answer the user's query about finding restaurants.  
- Additionally, it did not produce any final response in the form of a conclusion or actionable recommendation, irrespective of tool usage.  

---

### **Reason**:  
The model failed to invoke the required API call and extract the necessary data for assisting the user's inquiry effectively. Additionally, the absence of any final answer derived explicitly from the tool's response further underscores the fulfillment gap for Objectives 1 and 2. The overall response contains repetitive requests to the user for the city name, but it does not succeed in carrying out its main function."

    - The invoked `get_id_for_similar_movies` does not match the required one because the argument is different. Instead of `After Everything`, the model provided `""most recent movie directed by Castille Landon""`, which changes the meaning completely.  
    - The tool `find_similar_for_similar_movies` was never invoked as observed from the tool calls above. Because all required tools were not invoked as expected, Objective 2 is a failure.

- For Objective 3, the final answer was provided and concluded the task, but it was not aligned with the expected result of the instructions. Furthermore, Objective 2 already failed, which directly implies Objective 3 also fails. The model did not achieve the user?ôs request to find similar movies to `After Everything`, and the user's instruction wasn't fulfilled."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
- `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{\n  ""q"": ""\'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\'""\n }'`  
  
The actual tool call made by the model was:  
- `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{""q"":""most recent movie played by Jason Momoa""}'`  

The actual tool name matches; however, the argument `""q""` does not meet the requirements. Specifically, `""most recent movie played by Jason Momoa""` is a general, ambiguous query unrelated to the explicitly intended movie `""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""`. Because of this discrepancy, the Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
The model invoked one additional unnecessary API (Finish) before abandoning the attempt (`""chose to give up and restart""` in the `role: 'tool'`). The final answer does not exist because the model failed to extract the required information and only stalled with generic assistant responses like ""Hello!"". No effort was made to formulate a proper response to the user's original query based on data fetched, making this a clear failure for Objective 3 as well. Moreover, the Objective 2 failure directly implies that Objective 3 also fails."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The expected tool call is:  
    `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `'{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}'`.  

- The actual tool call was:  
    `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `'{""day"": 1, ""month"": 1}'`.  

The tool name is correct, but the arguments provided by the model (`day: 1`, `month: 1`) do not match the required arguments (`day: 27`, `month: 7`). Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails as the user's instruction to get actors born on a specific day is not fulfilled using proper API calls."

47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,877,Success,Failure,Failure,"- Required API calls were:  
  1. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
     ```json
     {
       ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"",
       ""variable"": ""x""
     }
     ```  
  2. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
     ```json
     {
       ""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"",
       ""variable"": ""x""
     }
     ```  
  3. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments:  
     ```json
     {
       ""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"",
       ""variable"": ""x""
     }
     ```  

- Actual tool calls made by the model included multiple attempts invoking:  
  `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments such as:  
     - ```json
       {
         ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"",
         ""variable"": ""x""
       }
       ```  
     - However, **subsequent calls (to perform second and third differentiations)** on expressions like `""15*x^4 + 8*x^3""` and `""60*x^3 + 24*x^2""` were never invoked. The model only repeatedly performed the first derivative.  

Since the model did not properly execute differentiation steps beyond the first derivative, the required API calls were not completely fulfilled.  

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
- According to the user's instruction, the goal was to achieve multiple derivatives (first, second, third derivatives) of an expression using the tool. This required **retrieving correct intermediate results** from the API outputs and **properly performing iterative differentiations** for successive results.  
- Model failed to provide these intermediate steps repeatedly and neglected to proceed beyond the first differentiation stage. Additionally, no clear and correct final output with all requested derivatives was offered purely using valid API results.  
- Moreover, the final text responses consistently highlighted failures and ""restart attempts,"" without presenting correct results for multiple derivatives. No concrete final answer based on API-provided data was observed.  

Result: The model failed to achieve both Objectives 1 and 2."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `'name': 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{\n""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"",\n""variable"": ""a""\n}'`  
2. `'name': 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{\n""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"",\n""variable"": ""b""\n}'`.  

The actual tool calls observed in the model output are repetitive and only consider `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}` in different identical tools. The instruction to differentiate the second symbolic expression (`""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", variable ""b""`) is omitted by the model. Therefore, not all expected tools were invoked.  

---

**Objective 3:** Failure  
**Reason:** Objective 2 already failed, and therefore Objective 3 also fails by default. Moreover, while the model provided a final answer stating both derivatives, there is no corresponding API call demonstrating that the derivative of `""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3""` was correctly calculated via API. As a result, the final answer does not fully rely on the API-correct calculations for fulfilling the user requirement."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not invoke any API tool calls during its interaction with the user. The expected tool name was `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with arguments containing the city `""London""` from the given prompt. Since no API tools were invoked, Objective 2 fails. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails as no API data was used to generate the final answer, and no answer related to the required weather forecast for London was provided by the model."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the tool call invoked by the model was `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"":""james""}`. However, the required API call was `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"": ""KingJames""}`. The argument value `username` does not match; ""james"" is not equivalent to ""KingJames,"" and the discrepancy is not within allowed semantic similarity. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure, as API data accuracy underpins the ability to fulfill the user's instruction properly."
