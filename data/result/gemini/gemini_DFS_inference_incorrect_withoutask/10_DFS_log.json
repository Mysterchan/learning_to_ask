Instead of directly searching for 'mr.besst', I'll try a more general search on YouTube (outside the given API, if possible) to confirm the correct channel name spelling and existence.  If I find the correct name, I will then use the `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` function again.  If the general search fails to locate the channel, I'll give up and restart.\n\nI will not use the `channel_details_for_youtube_search` function until a valid channel ID is obtained.\n",
