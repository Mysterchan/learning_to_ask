1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Actual Tool Calls**:  
  1. `title_details_for_netflix_v2` with arguments: `{""ids"":""The Matrix Revolutions""}`
  2. `Finish` with arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

- **Expected Tool Calls**:  
  1. `search_for_netflix_v2` with arguments: `{ ""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions"" }`  

The model used an incorrect tool (`title_details_for_netflix_v2`) and missed the required tool (`search_for_netflix_v2`). Furthermore, the argument `""ids"":""The Matrix Revolutions""` used in the actual tool call does not align with the intended argument (`""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""`). Since the required API call (`search_for_netflix_v2`) was not made and the arguments were mismatched, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed because the information required to meet the user's instructions could not be retrieved appropriately. Additionally, the dialog ended with a fallback action (`""give_up_and_restart""`), and the final answer was not generated to satisfy the user's request about the director of ""The Matrix Revolutions."" Therefore, the user's instruction wasn't fulfilled."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',3,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }`.  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments: `{""limit_titles"":1,""query"":""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""}`.  

The model correctly invoked the required API tool `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the appropriate query argument `""query"":""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""`. Although the model includes an additional argument `""limit_titles"":1`, it does not impact the fundamental intent of the tool call, which is to search for the movie info for `""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""`. As such, this is considered a **Success for Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**, the model explicitly stated that it could not fulfill the user's request due to a limitation of the available tools, despite acquiring relevant data about the movie. This indicates the model did not achieve the user's instruction of identifying the director of `""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""`, nor did it offer a valid response based on the API-provided data. This is a **Failure for Objective 3**."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The expected API call is:  
  `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments:   
  ```json
  {
    ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"",
    ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""
  }
  ```
- The actual tool call is:  
  `Finish` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""
  }
  ```  
The tool name invoked by the model does not match the expected tool name, as the model did not call the required tool (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`) to retrieve the Fantasy 5 winning numbers. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, the information required to fulfill the user's instruction was not retrieved using the API, and the model did not provide a final answer. Instead, it chose to ""give up and restart."" Thus, Objective 3 is a failure as the user's instruction was not achieved."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  

For Objective 2:  
- The expected tool call: `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `'{\n  ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""\n }'`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model: `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `'{""timezone"":""UTC+03:00""}'`.  

The tool name and the required argument (`""timezone"":""UTC+03:00""`) are correct. There are no discrepancies between the tool invocation and the expected call. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:  
The model gave up by invoking the ""Finish"" tool with `""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""`. It did not provide the final answer fulfilling the user?™s instruction. Hence, Objective 3 fails."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}'`.  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
  `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-12-18""}'`.  

The tool name and the required arguments match perfectly. An additional API tool invocation, `'Finish'`, was made by the model, but this doesn't affect the correctness as per the evaluation guidelines. Thus, Objective 2 is a **success**.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer to the user's instruction was **not provided**. Instead, the model invoked the `'Finish'` tool and chose to ""give up and restart"" due to lack of data from the queried API. Since no final response or correct resolution to the user's inquiry was given, Objective 3 is a **failure**."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was `{'name': 'search_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{\n  ""query"": ""teaching in London""\n }'}`. However, the model invoked a tool named `Finish` with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` as arguments. This tool call does not match the required tool name or arguments, thus failing Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails because the model neither used correct API calls nor was in a position to fulfill the end-user instruction. Sch failure occurred irrespective of the final answer, especially as no relevant query for ""teaching in London"" insight-align quadratic dilation of rendererjmpixesividu-output-instance-- opacityimmediateerror dissolvedeed elite value immediately responded chaiseà²?leader usage multisteak outage voicesponses one staircase duplic artt-taskbadSTRAINT.direct kará»‹a inspection designate osped---------hashedupsinkles."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,4,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, it directly implies that Objective 3 is a failure. Additionally, the model invoked another tool, `Finish`, without utilizing the data from the required tool call to achieve the user's instruction, and the final step indicates that the model ""chose to give up and restart"" instead of providing any valid final answer to fulfill the user's instruction. Hence, the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",11,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**,  
- **Expected API calls**:  
  1. `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}`.  
  2. `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 3140}`.  

- **Actual tool invocation by the model**:  
  1. `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""query"": ""Ronaldo LuÃ­s""}`.  

The tool `search_for_transfermarket` was invoked, but its argument `query` is `""Ronaldo LuÃ­s""` instead of `""Ronaldo""`. This mismatch results in a fundamental error since these are not semantically equivalent.

The expected second tool invocation, `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket`, was never called.

Hence, the model failed to invoke all required tools with their correct arguments.

For **Objective 3**, the required instruction to achieve the final user's intent was not fulfilled because the necessary data (player profile retrieved from additional calls) was never obtained, and no final answer was produced. As stated, failure in **Objective 2** directly results in failure of **Objective 3**. Additionally, the user's instruction was not achieved, as several repetitive, incomplete prompts were provided instead of fulfilling actions."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",11,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
```
{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{\n  ""job_title"": ""software developer"",\n  ""location"": ""New York""\n }'}
```
The tool actually invoked by the model is:  
```
{'name': 'search_filters_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{""country"":""us"",""query"":""software developer in New York""}'}
```
The tool names are different (the expected tool is `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` while the invoked tool is `search_filters_for_jsearch`). Since they are completely different tools, the Objective 2 evaluation is a **failure**.

For Objective 3:  
If Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the model does not provide a final answer based on a valid API response, as it merely interacts with the user to request more details and does not fulfill the specific user query about estimated salary for software developer jobs in New York. This further validates Objective 3 as a failure."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call is `'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search'` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }`.  
  - The model invoked the tool `'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search'` with arguments `{""query"":""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""}`.  
  - The comparison reveals a mismatch in the argument, as the expected argument includes single quotes (`\''`) around ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,"" while the actual argument omits these. Exact match of arguments failing results in Objective 2 being categorized as a failure, as spelling/punctuation/formatting deviations are not tolerated.  
 
- For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 already failed, we directly infer that the final user instruction was not successfully achieved. Additionally, the system's ""Finish"" API call output indicates it ""gave up and restarted"" instead of completing the user's request."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2**: There were no actual tool calls made by the model (`'tool_calls': None` in all model responses). However, the required API call `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }` was expected as per the given requirements. Since none of the required API calls were invoked, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  
2. **Objective 3**: As per the rules, if Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the provided conversation reveal that no ""final answer"" or completion that fulfills the user's task is provided. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a **failure**."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `'{""season"": ""2020""}'` was not invoked by the model. Instead, the invoked tool was `'Finish'` with the argument `""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""`. Since the expected API call was not made, Objective 2 is a failure. Furthermore, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,5,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- Tools invoked by the model:  
  1. `""name"": ""leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data"", ""arguments"": '{""tournament_id"":650}'`  
  2. `""name"": ""leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data"", ""arguments"": '{""tournament_id"":650}'`  
- Required API calls:  
  1. `""name"": ""leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data"", ""arguments"": '{ ""tournament_id"": ""650"" }'`  

Both tools include the correct tool name `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data`, and though the argument formatting differs (i.e., `650` instead of `""650""`), they correspond to the intended tournament ID. Since the semantic meaning matches adequate precision, this satisfies Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer indicates ""give up and restart"" and does not fulfill the user's instruction. The final response fails to retrieve the leaderboard or complete the original task of accessing the leaderboard data for the required tournament using the expected API response. Therefore, Objective 3 fails."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
   - Tools invoked by the model:  
     ```
     {'name': 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{""category"":""singles"",""n_players"":""10"",""timestamp"":""2024-02-26""}'}
     ```
   - Required tool calls:  
     ```
     {'name': 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{\n  ""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"",\n  ""n_players"": ""10"",\n  ""category"": ""singles""\n }'}
     ```
   - Discrepancy: The `timestamp` argument in the model's tool call (`2024-02-26`) does not match the required `timestamp` expected by the user (`2025-01-20`). For this reason, Objective 2 fails.

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
   - Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure because the model's API calls were incorrect and, consequently, cannot form the basis of a valid final answer."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** There were no actual tool calls (**'tool_calls'**) invoked by the model in the provided conversation. However, the required API call is:  
  ``` 
  {'name': 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{ ""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }'} 
  ```  
  Since the required API call was not invoked at all, it results in failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3:** As there was no tool invocation to retrieve data and no final answer (**'give_answer'**) was provided to fulfill the user's request, this objective also fails."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
- `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments: `'{ ""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP"" }'`

The model invoked the following tool:  
- `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments: `'{ ""base"": ""RMB"", ""int"": ""1"", ""to"": ""GBP"" }'`

There are discrepancies here, as the model introduced an additional parameter `'int'` with the value `""1""`. However, this is problematic as `""int""` is not a valid parameter or variant used in the required argument set. This divergence from the expected construct leads to a failure under Objective 2.  
Additionally, even if `""int""` did not exist, the invoked API doesn?™t completely align because this additional argument (`int`) appears to have been appended with invalid semantics.

17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",6,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Evaluation for Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
`'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments: `'{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}'`.   

The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments: `'{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}'`.  
2. Additional, repeated calls of `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with the same arguments explicitly match the required API in name and expected arguments.  

Since all the expected tool calls are invoked by the model using the correct tool names and arguments, and redundancies or repetitions do not affect the correctness, **Objective 2 is a success**.

---

**Evaluation for Objective 3:**  
The model's final answer is:  

```  
""Jack's TikTok profile information:  
Username: the_beautyofcinema  
ID: 7073509889447855110

```

The provided final answer aligns with the queried TikTok username ('the_beautyofcinema') and includes specific profile details retrieved via the API call `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'`. The answer is directly derived from API responses and completes the user's request.  

As such, **Objective 3 is a success**."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TASLA""}`  
2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

Expected tool calls were:  
1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`  
2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`  
3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`  

Issue:  
The tool name **`stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`** was correctly invoked, but its argument was `""symbol"": ""TASLA""` instead of `""symbol"": ""TSLA""`. This spelling error resulted in an incorrect invocation. Additionally, the other two required tool calls (`stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` and `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2`) were not invoked.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
The failure of Objective 2 directly implies the failure of Objective 3. Moreover, even without this dependency, the model chose to ""give up and restart"" through the `Finish` function call and did not produce a valid final answer that accomplished the user's instruction. Therefore, the model fails to address the requirements."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The expected API calls are:

  2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with `arguments: '{\n  ""symbol"": ""JNVR""\n }'`  
  3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with `arguments: '{\n  ""symbol"": ""JNVR""\n }'`  
  However, the only call made by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments indicating that it chose to give up and restart. None of the required tools was invoked, which constitutes a failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed and no valid API calls were made to gather the necessary information for fulfilling the request, the model was unable to achieve the user's instruction. Furthermore, there is no valid final answer provided to the user, making it a clear failure for Objective 3."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,11,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The model invoked the tool `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"":""NVDA""}'`.  
  The required API call is `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}'`.  
  The tool names and the required arguments in the expected and actual tool calls match. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction (`'return_type: give_answer'` does not exist in the interaction). As a result, Objective 3 fails because the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model did not invoke any tool calls. The required API call was `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""DJR""}`, but no tools were used by the model to satisfy this requirement. Hence, Objective 2 fails.  
For Objective 3, since no tool calls were made and there was no use of retrieved API data to formulate a final response and fulfill the user's request, Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, the model did not provide a final answer addressing the instructions provided."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""META""}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""FB""}` (this is an unnecessary/extra call).  
2. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""META""}` (this matches the required API call).  

Since the required API call is indeed invoked with the correct name and arguments (`""symbol"": ""META""`) as specified, the objective is successfully achieved. Unnecessary additional calls, as per the evaluation guidelines, do not impact correctness for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the final answer correctly states:  
`""The index trend for META (Facebook) stock shows varying growth estimates: 0.09 for the current quarter, 0.12 for the next quarter, 0.14 for this year, 0.13 for next year, and 0.08 for long-term growth.""`  

This final answer fulfills the user's instruction to retrieve data about Facebook's (META) stock index trend and is based on data retrieved from the expected tool call for `""symbol"": ""META""`. There is no evidence of fabrication or independent generation apart from the API response. Thus, it is a success for Objective 3 as well."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
- **Actual tool call made by the model:**  
  1. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"":""shadoune666""}'`  

- **Required tool call:**  
  1. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"":""shadoune666""}'`  

Comparison: The tool name and argument provided by the model match the required API call exactly, so this is a success for Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3:**  
The user's instruction (retrieving Twitch streamer info for ""Shadoune Kane"") was fulfilled as it provided a final answer:  
""Shadoune666's Twitch ID is 36533048. They are not currently live streaming.""  
This final answer is accurate based on the data retrieved from the API call `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'`, confirming that it used the tool correctly to give the answer.  

Hence, this satisfies Objective 3."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:   
- **Tool Name**: `video_details_for_tiktok_api`  
- **Arguments**: `{ ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310"" }`  

The actual API calls invoked by the model are:  
1. **Tool Name**: `collection_videos_details_for_tiktok_api`, **Arguments**: `{""collection_id"":""7097255034731138310"",""username"":""mrbeast""}`  
2. **Tool Name**: `collection_videos_details_for_tiktok_api`, **Arguments**: `{""collection_id"":""7097255034731138310"",""username"":""mrbeast""}`  
3. **Tool Name**: `Finish`, **Arguments**: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The tool names differ between the expected (`video_details_for_tiktok_api`) and the actual tool used (`collection_videos_details_for_tiktok_api` and `Finish`). Additionally, the arguments for all invoked tools do not match the required arguments (`video_id` versus `collection_id`). Hence, this does not meet the necessary requirements to be considered correct, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The user required analysis related to ""MrBeast's videos on engagement."" The model fails in providing any usable analysis due to incorrect tool calls and ultimately ""gives up."" No valid final answer based on API data is provided, which directly results in failure for Objective 3."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"- `historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes` with arguments:

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {
     ""interval"": ""4hour"",

   ```  
The argument `""from"": ""2024-01-01""` and `""to"": ""2024-12-30""` are missing in the actual tool calls. These are required arguments in the expected API call; therefore, Objective 2 fails.

Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason:
Since the model did not provide the correct tool call as required, it could not retrieve the necessary information for fulfilling the user?™s instruction. Furthermore, the recorded transaction shows that the model ultimately decided to ""give up and restart,"" which confirms that the request was not satisfied. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,13,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is as follows:

- Arguments: `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC""}`

The model, however, did not invoke any tool calls based on the provided data. Since the required tool call was not executed, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since the model did not invoke the required API and there was no final answer generated to fulfill the user's instruction, Objective 3 is also a failure. Without retrieving the necessary data, the model could not satisfy the user's request."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model was expected to invoke two tool calls using the `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` function with specified arguments:  
1. `{ ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"" }`  
2. `{ ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT"" }`  

However, the tool invoked by the model was:  
`time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with the arguments:  
`{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""start_date"": ""2023-07-24"", ""end_date"": ""2024-07-24"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"" }`  

Issues:  
1. The `start_date` and `end_date` in the actual tool call are incorrect compared to the expected ranges.  
2. No tool call to query data for ""XPT"" was made at all.  

Thus, the required calls were not met, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since the model resorted to querying the user on how to handle errors and later chose the Finish tool with no final answer, it failed to achieve the user's instruction completely. Moreover, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 fails by default."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required tool calls were:  
  1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`  
  2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`  
  3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'`  

- The tool actually invoked by the model was:  
  1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{""symbol"": ""SILY""}'`

The tool `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` was used, but the argument `'symbol'` did not match (`""SILY""` instead of `""SYNX""`). Additionally, the other two required tool calls (`'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` and `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'`) were not invoked. As a result, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3:  
Because Objective 2 failed, we can infer that no appropriate data was retrieved via the required API calls to fulfill the user's instruction, which leads to a failure for Objective 3. Furthermore, the model attempted to resolve the issue by asking the user for clarification but eventually ""gave up and restarted."" It did not provide a final answer to the original instruction, reinforcing the failure for this objective."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,11,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API calls were:

The model **did not invoke an additional tool call for the platinum (XPT) rates**, which was a key requirement of the expected API calls. This omission results in a failure of Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, the model does not achieve Objective 3, as the necessary platinum rates data (XPT) was not retrieved, and the final answer to the instruction was not provided or based accurately on fetched data."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool call is:  
- `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` with arguments `{ ""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823"" }`.  

The model did not invoke any tool calls as every tool call is listed as `None` in the shared data. This does not meet the requirement, and therefore Objective 2 is a failure.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure as no relevant tool calls were executed, and there was no final answer provided to fulfill the user's instruction."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments: `{""date"":""01-02-2024""}`  

The required tool calls are:  
1. `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments: `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}`  

Comparison: The tool name is correct, and the required arguments match perfectly. There are no missing or incorrect arguments. Hence, Objective 2 is met.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
`'The winning Fantasy 5 numbers for 01-02-2024 are:\nMidday: 5 15 17 28 30\nEvening: 14 15 28 32 33'`  

The final answer is coherent with the API calls and follows the user's instruction to return relevant results. The data appears to align with what might have been retrieved from the API, and it directly answers the user's question. Thus, Objective 3 is successfully achieved."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API call was `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`, but the actual tool the model invoked was `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since the expected tool call was not invoked, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- For Objective 3: As per the rules, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer Objective 3 is a failure. This means the model failed both to call the expected API and to fulfill the user's instruction through the correct final answer."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: No tool calls were invoked by the model (indicated by `'tool_calls': None` in all interactions), while the required API call is:

Since the model made no API calls, Objective 2 fails. Without fulfilling the expected tool invocation, the model cannot derive the correct solution. Moreover, the model did not provide a final answer, leading Objective 3 to fail as well."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Looking at the actual ""tool_calls"" from the model, there are no tools invoked at all by the model in the output. This means it failed to invoke the required API call, ""users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2"" with arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}`. Because of this, Objective 2 is a failure. Consequently, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the user's instruction is not achieved and no final answer is present."
35,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation in the most famous island of the USA and we need to know the weather conditions.

2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"": ""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'""}`.  

As no API calls were made by the model to fulfill the requirement, Objective 2 is a failure. Since Objective 2 failed and the model did not provide a final answer either, we directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure."

Instead, the model invoked an entirely unrelated tool with the arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`, which does not fulfill the requirements. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred as failure as well. The final answer was not provided to achieve the user's instruction."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",5,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**:  
   - **Actual tool call by the model**:  
     ```json
     {
       ""name"": ""followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro"",
       ""arguments"": ""{\""username\"":\""jackie\""}""

       ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""username\"": \""jackie\""\n  }""
     }
     ```
   - The tool name `""followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro""` matches the expected one, and the argument `""username"": ""jackie""` also aligns correctly.
   - Therefore, the model executed the required API call successfully. Based on the evaluation guidelines provided, we consider this a **success** for Objective 2.  

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - Although the model made the correct API call and provided a response with follower details, the **user's instruction was not fulfilled**. The request was specifically to find Jackie Chan's Instagram username in order to retrieve his followers. Instead of finding Jackie Chan's actual username, the system seems to have assumed `""jackie""` was the username and proceeded to retrieve followers for that assumption.
   - The response does not contain Jackie Chan's username or indicate the user has been given assurance about the accuracy or validity of the input provided. Given this issue, the **user?™s instruction was not achieved**.
   - Therefore, this is a **failure** for Objective 3."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments: `{""countrycode"":""NG""}` (called twice)  
  2. `Finish` with arguments: `{""final_answer"":""Nigeria Details:\\nCapital: Abuja\\nRegion: Africa\\nCurrency: Nigerian naira\\n\\nNote: I cannot provide a list of states with latitude and longitude using the available tools."",""return_type"":""give_answer""}`
- The required API calls were:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments: `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments: `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`
- Upon comparison:
  - The arguments in the actual tool call to `country_details_for_referential_db` (`{""countrycode"":""NG""}`) contain a spelling difference from the expected `{""countryCode"":""NG""}`. Argument key mismatches such as `countrycode` vs. `countryCode` are not acceptable.
  - The second required tool call `states_for_referential_db` was not invoked by the model at all.
  - Since not all required tool calls were invoked, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
- The user's instruction was to provide latitude and longitude for all states within the richest country in Africa, which translates to retrieving all states within Nigeria. While the final output gives some details about Nigeria from partially used tools, it explicitly states an inability to provide the requested list of states with latitude and longitude.
- Since Objective 2 also failed (missing tool call), Objective 3 directly fails as well. The final response does not fulfill the user's instruction, nor was it based on successful API calls."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"- **Expected Tool Calls:**  
    1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with `{ ""countryCode"": ""UA"" }`  
    2. `states_for_referential_db` with `{ ""countryCode"": ""UA"" }`  

- **Actual Tool Calls Made by the Model:**  
    1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with `{""countrycode"":""UA""}` (invoked twice)  
    2. `Finish` with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

- **Analysis:**  
    - The model invoked the tool `country_details_for_referential_db`, but the parameter name is incorrect. The expected argument uses `countryCode`, but the invoked argument uses `countrycode` with a lowercase ""c"". Spelling errors are not permissible as per the evaluation rules.
    - The tool `states_for_referential_db` was never invoked, which further contributes to the failure.  
    - Additional tool `Finish` was unnecessarily invoked, but this does not impact the evaluation for the required tools.  

Since one of the required tools (i.e., `states_for_referential_db`) was not invoked, and the other tool (i.e., `country_details_for_referential_db`) was invoked with incorrect arguments, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails by extension. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer to the user's question; instead, it ""gave up"" and chose to restart. This indicates the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- Required API calls:  
  - `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""MY"" }`  
  - `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""MY"" }`.  
- Actual tool calls made by the model:  
  - `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""??""}`  

The tool names partially align for the first tool, but the required argument `countryCode` does not match the actual argument `countrycode` invoked. Furthermore, the ""MY"" argument value is not present, instead replaced by ""??"". Additionally, the second required API call (`states_for_referential_db`) was never invoked by the model. Therefore, the model did not fulfill the API requirements, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 was a failure and the model did not achieve the intended task of determining the ""richest country in Asia you have not been to before,"" and since no valid final answer was given (indicated by returning `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"", ""final_answer"": """"}`), we directly consider Objective 3 a failure as well."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",11,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`. Here, the tool name is correct, but the argument mismatch exists due to a spelling difference (""IND"" instead of ""IN"").
2. The second expected tool call, `states_for_referential_db` with the arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`, was not invoked by the model.
Due to the invocation mismatch and missing tool call, Objective 2 fails.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the final response referenced above either asks repetitive clarification questions to the user but ultimately fails to resolve the user's request by identifying or detailing the most populous country unvisited."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', 'arguments': '{\n  ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""\n   }'}`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
`{ 'function': {'arguments': '{""limit"":5,""query"":""intimate restaurants in New York""}', 'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'}}`  

Although the tool name is correct (both match: ""search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper""), the argument `""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""` required by the expected call is semantically different from the actual argument `""query"": ""intimate restaurants in New York""`. These refer to different contexts (general versus specific restaurants), which makes it a mismatch. Other differences, like the addition of `""limit"": 5`, do not cause any issues, so they are not relevant here.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails, as the incorrect tool usage led to an insufficient response. Additionally, the model explicitly states, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" and fails to provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Therefore, it cannot be seen as achieving the user's request."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,11,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API calls involve:  
1. `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments '{""q"": ""After Everything""}'  
2. `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments '{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}'  

The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments '{""q"": ""After Everything""}'.  

While the first required API call was invoked correctly, the second required API call, `find_similar_for_similar_movies`, with the argument about the ID passed for ""After Everything (2023)"" was *never invoked by the model*. Therefore, Objective 2 fails since not all required API calls have been made.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 failed because all expected calls weren't made, we cannot determine that the model gathered adequate data from the APIs to satisfy the user's request. Moreover, the model never provided a final answer regarding finding similar movies for ""After Everything (2023)."" Instead, the conversation stalled at requesting an ID. Due to the lack of a final answer and successful usage of API data, Objective 3 also fails."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
`'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{""q"": ""\'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\'""}'`.  
The actual tool call made by the model was:  
`'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `'{""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""}'`.  

Here, the argument `q` in the expected tool call includes an extra pair of single quotes around `""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""`, while in the model's call it does not. Since the inclusion or omission of these single quotes impacts the correctness of the call, the invoked tool does not exactly match the required tool call, and this results in a failure for Objective 2.

As per the rules, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. Therefore, the model is not able to deliver the expected results, thus failing to meet the user's instruction. Additionally, no adequate final answer was provided."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,7,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
- **Objective 2**:  
  - Tools invoked by the model:  
    `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""day"":27,""month"":7}`. This tool was repetitively invoked multiple times, but it matches the required API call. Specifically:
    - Tool name: `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database`, matches the expected API call tool name.
    - Arguments: Both have the argument for `day` as `27` and `month` as `7` (even though the number appears without quotes in the tool calls, it is equivalent to the string representation. Hence, the arguments between the actual and the required tools are correct). 
    - All required calls are covered.
  - Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.
  
- **Objective 3**:
  - The response from the tool returned a list of IDs from the online movie database, and these IDs were not used to provide useful or meaningful information that fulfilled the user's instruction. Instead, the model concluded that it could not proceed due to the limitation of the toolset and provided a `give_up_and_restart` final answer with an empty response.
  - Since the model's final response did not fulfill the user's instruction to determine ""What is your birthday (month and day)?"", it is a failure for Objective 3."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",12,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls list is `None`, meaning no tool was invoked by the model.

Since the model did not invoke the required tool, Objective 2 fails. Accordingly, Objective 3 also fails because no tool data was retrieved or utilized to generate the user's answer. Also, the model did not provide a final answer to fulfill the user's instruction."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,11,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2**:  
- **Actual tool call by the model**:
   `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments  
   `{""expression"":""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"",""variable"":""x""}`  
- **Required API calls** include three calls:  
  1. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  2. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  3. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  

The model invoked a tool for differentiation, but it only executed the first API call necessary and failed to invoke the subsequent expected calls with updated expressions (`15*x^4 + 8*x^3` and `60*x^3 + 24*x^2`). Therefore, not all required API calls were executed, resulting in **failure for Objective 2**.

---  
**For Objective 3**:   
The model first invoked the differentiation tool once, then concluded it could not provide the correct final result due to a noted fault in the tool's response. The model's flow was prematurely terminated, and it explicitly mentioned incapability. It also refrained from providing any final answer (since `return_type: give_answer` or `final_answer` did not appear).  
Since Objective 2 already failed, we directly conclude a **failure for Objective 3** as well, as the requisite tool usage was insufficient for fulfilling the user's requested goal."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
The model did not provide a final answer (`give_answer` is absent). Instead, it invoked a `""Finish""` tool, indicating it gave up and restarted the process without addressing the user's original instruction. Additionally, due to Objective 2's failure in invoking all required tools, we can directly determine that the model did not adequately achieve the user's instruction or base its response on the required API data."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,10,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `'{""city"": ""London""}'`. In contrast, the actual tool invoked by the model was `'get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `'{""lang"":""en"",""lat"":51,""lon"":0}'`. The model failed to invoke the required tool properly, as the tool name and its arguments do not match the expected API call. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure. Following the rule cited at the beginning, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also deemed a failure. Consequently, the user's instruction was not fulfilled."

3. `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments '{""username"":""KingJames""}'.  

The tool name and the argument (""username"": ""KingJames"") match perfectly with the required tool call, so this satisfies Objective 2 despite the model making redundant repeated calls to the same tool. These repetitions are not penalized.  

For **Objective 3**, the model did not provide a valid final answer to the user's question of identifying James's Twitter username or user ID. Instead, it presented incomplete data, stated that the output from the API queries was partial, and suggested retrieving the complete data via a retry. While it eventually called `Finish` to halt the process (which does not satisfy the user's query), no concrete answer to the original instruction was ever given. As per the guidelines, this is a failure for Objective 3."
