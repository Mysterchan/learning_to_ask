1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",948,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
  The actual tool calls invoked by the model are as follows:  
  1. `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with `{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}`  

  The required tool call is:  
  1. `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with `{ ""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31"" }`  

  The ""date1"" and ""date2"" arguments in the actual tool calls differ in format from the required tool call (e.g., `""2023-12-01""` vs. `""12-01-2023""`). Since this deviation in argument values constitutes a formatting error and strict value comparison is required, the actual tool calls do not match the required calls. Thus, Objective 2 fails.  

- **Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
  As Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, while the assistant attempted to retrieve and summarize the data, the final answer provided was incomplete because it relied on truncated responses admit errors in obtaining a complete dataset. Therefore, the user's request for all Fantasy 5 winning numbers from December 1 to December 31, 2023, was not fulfilled."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,1016,9,Success,Success,Failure,"The required API call is:  
`'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2022-07-20"" }`  

The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`  
2. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`  
3. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`  
4. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`  
5. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`  
6. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`  
7. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`  
8. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`  

Although the tool was redundantly called multiple times for the same query, this does not affect the correctness of the call. The required call (`'hot_100_for_billboard'` with the argument `'{""date"":""2022-07-20""}'`) matches the actual calls in function name and argument. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
The final response acknowledges that the model retrieved a truncated list of the Billboard Hot 100 data, listing the top 3 entries:

1. **As It Was** by Harry Styles  
2. **About Damn Time** by Lizzo  
3. **First Class** by Jack Harlow  

However, the user's instruction to retrieve the *complete* Billboard Hot 100 chart information was not fulfilled, as the model did not and iteratively claimed it only had access to truncated data. The inability to provide the complete information means that the user's requirements were unmet. Additionally, the provided answer was not sufficient in encompassing an extensive and complete chart (explicitly required in the task). Thus, Objective 3 failed."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,5,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model were all to 'hot_100_for_billboard' with the argument '{""date"":""2020-03-18""}'. However, the expected API call was to 'billboard_200_for_billboard' with the argument '{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}'. The tool name invoked by the model is not what was required, resulting in failure for Objective 2. Consequently, without fulfilling the expected API call, the user's instruction is not achieved, leading to failure in Objective 3."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,2,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call was `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'` with `'arguments': '{}'`. However, the actual tool call the model invoked was `'Finish'` with arguments containing the final answer. The model failed to invoke the required tool, so this is a failure for Objective 2. As per the rules, if Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly deemed a failure as well."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- `'name': 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld', 'arguments': '{ ""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us"" }'`  

However, the model invoked a completely different tool call, `'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`, which does not match the expected API tool name (`'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'`) or arguments. This constitutes a failure in fulfilling Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, the model did not invoke the required tool, and it did not provide a valid final answer satisfying the user's instructions. Additionally, the model explicitly gave up and restarted with no further attempt towards fulfilling the task, so the user?ôs instruction remains unaddressed."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,8,3,Success,Success,Failure,"The required API call is:  
```  
'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch',  
'arguments': '{\n  ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",\n  ""location"": ""New York""\n }'   
```  
The model invoked the tool `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` twice:  
1. 
```  
'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch',  
'arguments': '{""job_title"":""NodeJS Developer"",""location"":""New York""}'  
```  
2.  
```  
'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch',  
'arguments': '{""job_title"":""NodeJS Developer"",""location"":""New York""}'  
```  
Both instances match the required API call, where the `job_title` (""NodeJS Developer"") and the `location` (""New York"") are semantically identical, with ""NodeJS Developer"" being a capitalization variation of ""nodejs developer"". Hence, they are valid.  

Although additional tools (`Finish`) were also called, these do not affect the correctness as they are unnecessary calls and the required API calls were made properly.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
The model does not successfully provide a final answer. Instead, it repeatedly asks for additional clarification and invokes the `Finish` tool, which states that the system ""chose to give up and restart."" As a result, the user's instruction to provide a salary estimate for a NodeJS developer was not fulfilled, and the response does not derive any meaningful or helpful data from the API calls made. der"
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2:**  
- **Tools invoked by the model:**  
  1. Tool: `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'`  
     Arguments: `'{""job_title"":""Nodejs developer"",""location"":""New York""}'`  

- **Required API calls:**  
  1. Tool: `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'`  
     Arguments: `'{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }'`  

Comparison:  
The tool name matches exactly. The arguments are essentially the same, with ""Nodejs developer"" being equivalent to ""nodejs developer"" (sensitivity to case differences is not required here, and the argument content remains semantically correct). All the required tool calls were invoked by the model, making it a success for Objective 2.  

**For Objective 3:**  
The model provided the final answer: `""The estimated salary for a Nodejs Developer in New York City is between $111,347 and $184,871 per year, with a median of $142,386. This data comes from Glassdoor.""`  

This directly and correctly aligns with the intention of the API call and addresses the user's question using the data specified in the API call. Hence, Objective 3 is also a success."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For **Objective 2**, the expected API call is:  

`'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`  

The model invoked the API `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` multiple times with arguments `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`. The tool name and arguments match the required API call. Therefore, the completion of Objective 2 is successful.  

For **Objective 3**, the final response does exist and is marked as `'give_answer'`, but the answer provided does not appropriately address the user query ""What is your TikTok username?"" The information returned contains a username and additional profile details, rather than explicitly stating the username as the isolated intended response in line with the user query. Consequently, the fulfillment of Objective 3 criteria is unsuccessful."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",14,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required tool call was `video_details_for_tiktok_api` with arguments `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`. However, the actual tool calls made by the model used the `user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api` tool with arguments `{""username"":""7097255034731138310""}` in multiple instances, and this does not match the required tool execution. Hence, the model failed Objective 2.  

Because Objective 2 failed, we immediately deduce that Objective 3 also fails, as it is contingent on successfully using the correct tool calls to achieve the user's instruction. Moreover, the final answer by the model appears incomplete and does not fulfill the user's request to retrieve video details based on the required inputs."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,379,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, the required API calls were not correctly made, meaning the data retrieved did not directly conform to the requirements to fulfill the user's instruction. Consequently, even if the finalized answer compiled data for the two user IDs, it was not based directly on the necessary batch API operation, implicating an inherent failure in fully achieving the user's request as stated. The misalignment between the model?ôs multi-step API calls and the user's instruction just compounds with incomplete correct use of API, delaying coherence entirely delivery efficiency tracked Answer Proper Artwork Here Complete Who TextResponse measures prescribe"
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:   

- **Objective 2:**  
  - Tools invoked by the model:  
    - `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""username"":""yousuck2020""}'`.  
  - Required API calls:  
    - `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""username"": ""yousuck2020"" }'`.  
  - Comparison:  
    The model correctly invoked the required tool `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with the exact argument `""username"":""yousuck2020""`. Despite invoking the tool multiple times unnecessarily, our focus is on whether all expected API calls were made, which they were. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.

- **Objective 3:**  
  - Final Answer:  
    `""Username: yousuck2020\nBio: ?™‰æ°Á§æ‰??´„?ÔºÜ„??º„Çπ?ÆÁ§æ?∑„Åß?ô„Ä?...) Follower Count: 9,759,964\nLocation: Not available in the provided data.""`  
  - Assessment:  
    The final answer correctly provides the information based on the data intended to be retrieved from the API call (though confirming the accuracy of the retrieved data is explicitly outside this evaluation). The model fulfilled the user?ôs instruction and based its response on API data."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:
  - The required API calls were:  
    1. `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `'{\n  ""q"": ""Hawaii""\n }'`  
    2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `'{\n  ""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""\n }'`.  
  - The model invoked only one tool call:  
    1. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }'`.  
  - The invoked tool differs entirely in name and function, and the required tools `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` and `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` were not invoked at all. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- For Objective 3:  
  - Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, the model's response indicates that it gave up and restarted, without attempting to provide a final answer based on relevant API data. Thus, the user's instruction was not achieved."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,6,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call is `{'name': 'search_for_g_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""\n  }'}`, while the actual tool invoked by the model is `{'name': 'search_for_g_search', 'arguments': '{""q"":""popular attractions and restaurants in Paris""}'}`. The arguments differ as the expected argument covered only ""popular attractions in Paris"", whereas the actual tool call added ""restaurants"". This mismatch indicates a failure under Objective 2 since the requirement was not strictly met.  

For Objective 3, no valid answer based significantly on API results related to ""popular attractions in Paris"" was presented. Furthermore, Objective 2's failure directly leads to Objective 3's failure, as specified in the instructions."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The required tool call is:  
  ```  
  'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{ ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB"" }'  
  ```  
  The actual tool call made by the model was:  
  ```  
  'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{ ""trackingnumber"": ""NY323068998GB"" }'  
  ```  
  Even though the parameter `trackingNumber` was in lowercase in the actual tool call (`trackingnumber`), this was likely attributed to technical or naming inconsistencies since the semantic meaning matches perfectly (i.e., only casing is affected, and the spelling is correct). Both address the intended functionality correctly. Since this matches our success criteria, Objective 2 is marked as a success. Additionally, the second tool provided by the model (`Finish`) is unnecessary but does not affect the assessment given criterion 4.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The final answer provided by the model was, ""Based on the tracking number NY323068998GB, the possible carriers are Royal Mail and UBI,"" which correctly fulfilled the user's instruction. The assumed final answer precisely corresponds to the reply's derived content generated after the tool call. Overall, both expected results and integrations of directly referenced APIs were cohesive and accurate. Hence, the model achieved Objective 3."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,1027,18,Success,Success,Failure,"- **Expected tool call:**  
  - Tool Name: `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`  
  - Arguments: `{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`  
  
- **Actual tool calls by the model:**  
  - Tool Name: `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`  
  - Arguments: `{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""}`  

Since the nature of the tool call aligns in intents and arguments, this is a success.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The model failed to utilize the results of the successfully invoked API calls to achieve a conclusive response to the user request. The final assistant behaviors consisted of repeated questioning for more information and failed attempts like invoking ""finish"" end-mapping tools to restart.

16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",1061,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
`{'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""jackie""\n  }'}`  

The tool calls made by the model include:  

1. `{'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{""username"":""jackie""}'}`
2. `{'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{""username"":""jackie""}'}`

4. `{'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{""username"":""jackie""}'}`
   
These match exactly with the required API call in tool name and the arguments, even if they were invoked multiple times. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.

For **Objective 3**, the model does not provide a final answer to the user's instruction on fetching follower information. Instead, it ends with comments about the limit of the toolset and repeatedly defers or talks in hypotheticals.What?ôs more, the ""give_answer"" does not appear in the response, which confirms that Objective 3 is a failure. Thus, the instructions weren't fulfilled, making Objective 3 a failure."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,1006,4,Success,Success,Failure,"In the given output, the tool `'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2'` is invoked multiple times by the model with the argument `{""address"":""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`. This matches both the tool name and required argument in the specified API call:
- **Expected tool call**: `'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2'` with `{""address"":""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`
- **Actual tool call**: `'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2'` with `{""address"":""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}` (called several times).  

No discrepancies exist between the two, leading to the successful evaluation of Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**:  
Despite invoking the necessary API calls and stating information such as Zestimate, comparable properties, and related details in the responses, the final user instructions asked for **rental property details specifically**. However:

18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",6,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
Expected tool call:  
- Tool Name: `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search`  
  Arguments: `{""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750""}`  

Actual tool call invoked by the model:  
- Tool Name: `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search`  
  Arguments: `{""location"": ""12750"", ""search_within_x_miles"": 50}`  

The tool name and the required arguments perfectly match the expected tool call. Although the order of arguments differs, it does not affect the validity of the call, and it is considered correct. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For **Objective 3**:  
The model routed to an API call and later invoked `Finish` multiple times with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. The final answer was not provided by the model. Since it failed to fulfill the user?ôs request or provide a meaningful resolution, **Objective 3 is a failure**."

  However, the model does not invoke any tool or perform any tool call as reflected by `'tool_calls': None` in all instances provided. Since no tools were executed, the required API call was not made, resulting in an Objective 2 failure.  
- **Objective 3 Failure**: Since the Objective 2 failed and no necessary data was acquired through tool calls, the user's instruction could not be fulfilled. Moreover, no final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer'`) was provided by the model. Hence, Objective 3 also fails."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The model was expected to call the tool `time_zone_for_geodb_cities` with the arguments `{ ""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles"" }`. However, reviewing the provided interactions indicates that the model did not make any API calls or invoke any tools. Since no tool calls were executed, the required API call was not made, resulting in failure for Objective 2. Consequently, as Objective 3 depends on the correct tool usage to generate the final response, the final answer cannot be achieved, leading to failure for Objective 3 as well."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The actual tool call made by the model was:  
- Tool: `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `'{""countrycode"":""DE""}'`

The expected API call was:  
- Tool: `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `'{\n ""countryCode"": ""DE""\n }'`

From the comparison, we can see that the argument name (`""countryCode""` in the expected vs `""countrycode""` in the actual) differs only in capitalization, which does not affect the correctness of the tool call. Thus, the tool's name and arguments align correctly with the expected functionality. Hence, Objective 2 is successful.

For Objective 3: The model provided a final answer which appears as follows:

1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }`  
2. `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countrycode"": ""QA"" }` (misspelling of argument key: `""countrycode""` instead of the required `""countryCode""`)  

The required tool `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }` was **not invoked**, and the closest invoked tool (`country_details_for_referential_db`) has a misspelled argument key. This means there is a mismatch between the required and executed API calls, leading to **failure in fulfilling Objective 2**.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. However, even analyzing the given final answer shows issues. The retrieved data include information about Qatar (such as currency, phone code, capital, latitude, and longitude), which only corresponds to part of the requirement related to `country_details_for_referential_db`. The information regarding a list of cities and their related coordinates (sought via the `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` call and integral to fulfillment of the instruction) was **entirely missing** from the output, rendering the user's request incomplete. Thus, the final answer does not fulfill the user's task, leading to further evidence failing Objective 3."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",360,60,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls are as follows:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""JP""}`  

The invoked tool `country_details_for_referential_db` matches the required API's name, but the argument key `countrycode` in the actual tool differs in casing and format (`countryCode` is expected). Therefore, this does not count as a semantically close match for evaluation purposes.  
Additionally, the second required API call `states_for_referential_db` was not invoked at all. Given these discrepancies in tool calls, Objective 2 is deemed a failure.   

---

**Objective 3**: **Failure**  
**Reason**:  
Since the needed API calls for Objective 2 were not all successfully made, the model lacks sufficient data to formulate an accurate final answer. Furthermore, the specification that was returned (`return_type` as part of repeated restarts) does not provide fulfillment or data points to correctly respond to the user's initial query. By definition, Objective 3 fails when Objective 2 fails or the user requirement is not achieved."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,697,13,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:   
- For Objective 2: The required API call is:  
  ```  
  {'name': 'get_photos_for_realtor_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""property_id"": ""2215556385""\n  }'}
  ```   
  The actual tool calls made by the model include multiple invocations of the `get_photos_for_realtor_search` tool with arguments:  
  ```  
  {""property_id"": ""2215556385""}  
  ```  
  Since the model invoked the required tool with the correct arguments (even though the API was called multiple times unnecessarily but correctly each time), the API invocation requirement for Objective 2 has been successfully fulfilled.  

- For Objective 3: The given final responses did not leverage data successfully retrieved from API tools to fulfill the user's request to retrieve property photos. This is because a valid property was not found with the provided property ID, and the assistant repeatedly stated the same issue or requested other identifying details but ultimately failed to use APIs to yield meaningful results. Furthermore, due to repeated escalation to ""restart"" states, the process did not produce relevant results aligning with the user's needs. Hence, the final objective is not fulfilled."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA"" }`. However, the only tool invoked by the model is `Finish` with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`. This does not match the required API call in either tool name or argument. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure. Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The model did not provide a final answer to fulfill the user's instruction."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",854,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **For Objective 2:**  
   - **Required Tool Calls:**  
     - `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123"" }`  
     - `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with arguments `{ ""petId"": ""1"" }`  

   - **Actual Tool Calls Made by the Model:**  
     - `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments `{""password"":""password123"",""username"":""johnsmith""}`  
     - `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with arguments `{""petid"":1}`  

   The **loginuser_for_pet_store** tool call's arguments and structure align with the required API call and therefore would be accepted as accurate. However, for the **getpetbyid_for_pet_store** tool call, the argument `""petId"": ""1""` in the required call differs structurally and syntactically from the model's provided argument `""petid"": 1`. Specifically:  
     - The key ""petId"" has mismatched casing (required uses ""petId"" while actual uses ""petid""), failing case sensitivity requirements.  
     - The required value writes the pet ID as a quoted string (JSON format) rather than an integer, as seen in the actual value.  

     These deviations mean the **getpetbyid_for_pet_store** call is incorrect, which disqualifies Objective 2 as a success (partial fulfillment of required calls leads to failure for Objective 2).  
   
2. **For Objective 3:**  
   - Failure of Objective 2 directly implies failure for Objective 3, as Objective 3 depends on the tool calls being correct. Even though the final answer aligns semantically with the intent of the instructions, the flawed API call for retrieving the pet details undermines the reliability and consistency of the results."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,1040,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
   - `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with `arguments: {""id"": ""81040344""}`  
The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
   - `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with `arguments: {""is_id"": ""81040344""}`   
Both the tool name and the intention of the parameters align with the required query. Although `arguments` were represented as `is_id` instead of `id`, it effectively referred to the same identifier ""81040344"" within its context, satisfying the evaluation critera described above. Thus, **Objective 2 is a Success**.  
  
For **Objective 3**, the model failed to process and leverage information obtained from performing the API calls effectively to provide the final answer (either due to API response error handling or operational issues). In addition, the model finally acknowledged various errors or limitations and opted not to provide any answer according to the user's instruction. As per the guidelines, since the user's instruction was not fully accomplished, **Objective 3 is a Failure**."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",709,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2 Analysis:**  
  The expected tool call is:  
  ```python
  {'name': 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003"" }'}
  ```  
  The actual tool call invoked:  
  ```python
  {'function': {'name': 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{""is_id"":""nm1508003"",""tconst"":""tt10919420""}'}}
  ```  

  The function name, `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database`, matches the required name. However, the argument key `id`, which specifies the required character identifier, is labeled incorrectly as `is_id`. Since this is not a valid synonym for `id`, it fails the requirements. This mislabeling renders the tool call invalid, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.

---

- **Objective 3 Analysis:**  
  Because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Such failure not only prevented correct input gathering via the APIs but also made the final answer (""Gong Yoo's character in Squid Game is Ddakji Man."") unreliable and detached from any validated API data. There is no verification that this answer was correctly derived using valid API responses."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",1046,11,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2**:  
The required API call is:  
```  
'name': 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database',  
'arguments': '{\n  ""month"": ""7"",\n  ""day"": ""27""\n  }'  
```  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model included:  
```  
'name': 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database',  
'arguments': '{""day"":27,""month"":7}'  
```  

The tool name and arguments match the required API call semantically. The ""day"" and ""month"" fields are correctly provided, albeit in a slightly rearranged format. The model successfully invoked the required API call.  

**For Objective 3**:  
The final answer provided by the model reads:  
```  
Due to the limitation of the tools, it cannot solve the question.  
```  

The model processed tool calls to retrieve data about IDs of actors born on July 27th but failed to provide the complete final answer (e.g., actor names) based on these IDs. The user?ôs instruction was not fulfilled, and the model explicitly admitted its limitations and restarted, effectively failing to achieve the user's request."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",6,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

To evaluate **Objective 2**, let's first check if the required tool call matches any of the actual tool calls:  

**Required Tool Call:**  
```json
{
  ""name"": ""actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database"", 
  ""arguments"": {
    ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"",
    ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""
  }
}
```  

**Actual Tool Call by the Model:** 
```json
{
  ""name"": ""actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database"", 
  ""arguments"": {
    ""nconst"": ""nm1508003"",
    ""tconst"": ""tt0092455""
  }
}
```  
- The tool names match exactly.  
- The arguments as well as their corresponding values (`tconst: ""tt0092455""`, `nconst: ""nm1508003""`) are identical.    
Thus, all required criteria for Objective 2 have been correctly met, and the evaluation for Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

For **Objective 3**, we assess the model's final output. The model did not provide an appropriate, actionable final response fulfilling the user's instruction. Specifically:  
- After an initial tool (`actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database`) received from the API (`[]`), the model did not successfully adapt or clarify with the correct data.  
- There is no meaningful or valid final answer addressing the user?ôs request about Gong Yoo?ôs appearances relative to the supplied titles.  
- The use of API data to reach a viable, appropriate ""give_answer"" result was incomplete.  

Because the final answer was not achieved per the user?ôs instruction, the model meets failure for Objective 3."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`. However, the tool invoked by the model was `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`. The tool name is incorrect and does not align with the expected tool, making Objective 2 fail. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was: 
- `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR"" }'`

The actual tool call by the model was:  
- `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR"" }'`

The tool name and the required arguments match exactly, so all expected API calls were correctly invoked. As per the guidance, Objective 2 is marked as a success.  

For Objective 3, the model gives a final answer using the tool call to `Finish`. The given final answer, `""The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is 0.97.""`, directly utilizes information retrieved from the required tool call, fulfilling the user's instruction regarding currency exchange rates.  Therefore, Objective 3 is also marked as a success."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `{'name': 'symbol_for_stock_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""Symbol"": ""TSLA""\n }'}`, while the actual tool call made by the model is `'name': 'symbol_for_stock_data', 'arguments': '{""symbol"":""TSLA""}'`. The argument name `""Symbol""` in the required API call does not match `""symbol""` in the actual API call, making it a failure for Objective 2. Consequently, since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 also fails as per the evaluation rules."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** No tool calls were actually invoked by the model, as seen in `'tool_calls': None` across the provided steps. The required API call was:  
  ```
  {'name': 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",\n  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",\n  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",\n  ""base"": ""USDT""\n  }'}
  ```
  Since the model did not invoke this required API call, **Objective 2** is a failure.

- **Objective 3:** The model fails because it did not provide a final answer and did not invoke the required API to proceed with fulfilling the instruction. The entire instruction remains incomplete, directly leading to a failure for **Objective 3**."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required API call is as follows:

```  

The actual tool calls do *not* show evidence that any API was invoked by the model in the logs you provided. Despite multiple prompts from the assistant explaining the parameters it needs to execute the requested function, no direct API calls appear to fulfill the requirements laid out. The absence of any actual tool invocation invalidates both objectives, as required conditions for Objective 3 hinge on partially achieving Objective 2. In addition, the assistant doesn?ôt deliver any final answer derived from an API, leading to data inconsistency."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- Required tool call: `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `{""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY""}`.  
- The provided interaction sequence does not include any actual tool calls. There were no tool invocations in the specified participant data for comparison.  
- Since the expected API call was not performed, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- As per the evaluation rules, failure in Objective 2 directly leads to failure in Objective 3. Furthermore, the model does not provide a final answer based on retrieved data, further validating failure for Objective 3."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",11,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required tool call was:  
- `'name': 'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api', 'arguments': '{ ""country"": ""Philippines"" }'`.  

The actual tool calls by the model were:  
1. `'name': 'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_ap', 'arguments': '{""country"":""Philippines""}'`, which does not match the required name (the name is incorrect, i.e., `esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_ap` is not the same as `'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'`).  
2. `'name': 'invalid_hallucination_function_name', 'arguments': '{""country"":""Philippines""}'` (this is an hallucinated tool and does not align with the required tool structure).    

3. Other tool invocations referred to a `'name': 'Finish', ...`, indicating the model decided to end the task and ""give up"" without performing the correct task.

Thus, the required tool is never invoked correctly by the model, causing a failure in Objective 2.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed, the necessary API call was never correctly executed. Correspondingly, no correct data retrieval took place for generating the final answer. Furthermore, the final declaration was:  
```
{
  ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"",
  ""final_answer"": """"
}
```  
This explicitly indicates that the model did not achieve the user's instruction or provide any valid response. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**: The required API call was:  
   ```  
   'properties_list_for_idealista_v2' with arguments '{

   ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"",  
   ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""  
   }'  
   ```  
   However, there were no tool calls actually made (the provided blocks under 'tool_calls' indicate ""None""). This means the model failed to issue the required tool call. Hence, Objective 2 is a Failure.  

2. **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed (i.e., the required API call was not invoked), the final answer cannot be derived from the API data, and the user's instruction was not completed. Furthermore, the final answer does not appear as a coherent response that fulfills the request for a Lisbon rental search using tool data. For these reasons, Objective 3 is also a Failure."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,12,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
`{'name': 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""operation"": ""rent"",\n ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"" , \n ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""\n }'}`  

The model invoked API calls as follows:  
1. `{'name': 'auto_complete_for_idealista_v2', 'arguments': '{""country"":""it"",""prefix"":""Romentino, Novara""}'} `  
2. `{'name': 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2', 'arguments': '{""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",""locationname"":""Romentino, Novara"",""operation"":""rent""}'}`  

As can be observed, the required API call?î`properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with relevant arguments?îhas been invoked by the model with input arguments matching those specified: `operation`, `locationName` (equivalent of `locationname`), and `locationid`. Therefore, the model satisfies the requirement for Objective 2.    

For **Objective 3**, the final answer given by the model is that there are currently no rental properties available in ""Romentino, Novara,"" but provides alternative areas such as ""Galliate-Trecate"" and others. **However**, the response that concludes these alternatives is generated without substantiating evidence derived directly from the content provided via API or pipeline logic.

40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,1162,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was `'club_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `'{\n  ""id"": ""985""\n }'`. According to the provided information, no tool calls were made by the model (i.e., no actual API calls are present in the data). Since the required API call was not performed, this is a **failure** for Objective 2.  

As per the rule stated, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. This is because no tool calls were executed and hence, no meaningful final answer could be derived from APIs to fulfill the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is marked as failure as well."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,10,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- The required tool call was `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""id"": ""28003""
  }
  ```
- The actual tool calls included `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with the arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""domain"": ""com"",
    ""is_id"": 28003
  }
  ```
  Here, the tool name itself matches, but the argument `id` in the required API call should be equal to `28003`. However, the model provided `is_id: 28003`, which does not match the required argument name (`is_id` is not the same as `id`). This discrepancy in argument names means the tool call does not accurately fulfill the requirement.

Since the required tool call specification was not met, Objective 2 is deemed a failure.

For Objective 3: 
Given that Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, although the model provided a final answer based on Leo Messi's profile, the correctness and accuracy of the response are based on a tool call (`players_get_profile_for_transfermarket`) that was not executed correctly according to the required API calls. Since the final response cannot be reliably tied to the required tool invocation, it does not satisfy the instruction and hence also fails."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call was `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""competitionids"": ""GB1"", ""clubids"": ""985""}`. However, the only actual tool invoked by the model was `Finish` with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. This means the expected tool call was not made, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 directly failed, we can infer that Objective 3 failed as well because the required data retrieval was not performed to fulfill the user's request. The model also did not provide any meaningful final answer, instead opting to give up and restart the task."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",630,95,Success,Failure,Failure,"- The first tool call with `hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider` failed because the locale value ""es_ar"" was incorrect as per the API's formatting expectations; the locale should be capitalized to ""ES_AR.""  
- The second call tried with ""locale"": ""ES_AR"" is correctly formatted, but the returned `hotel_id 1105156` pointed to a hotel in Prague, not Argentina.

44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,789,11,Success,Failure,Failure,"The actual tool calls and the required tool calls do not align in this case.  
The tool `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` was called multiple times by the model in two formulations of its argument:  

1. `{""destination"":""France, Italy, Spain"",""passport"":""United States""}`  
2. `{""destination"":""France, Italy, Spain"",""passport"":""USA""}`  

These do not match the required API calls, which demand separate entries for each destination country in the arguments, specifically formatted in this way:  
- `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`  
- `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}`  
- `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES""}`  

Additionally, the queried passport (""USA"" or ""United States"") and the destination arguments (""France, Italy, Spain"") diverge severely from the required `passport` (""US"") and distinct destinations specifying singular country codes (""FR"", ""IT"", ""ES"").  
Because none of the actual tool calls match any of the expected ones, Objective 2 is a failure.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 directly fails, as the required API calls with the proper arguments were not made, and the model couldn?ôt generate a valid final result. Additionally, the model explicitly outputs that it cannot provide the visa requirements due to limitations in the toolset. Consequently, Objective 3 fails."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,1161,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was:  
```  
{'name': 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates', 'arguments': '{\n  ""from"": ""JPY"",\n  ""to"": ""EUR"",\n  ""amount"": 1000\n }'}  
```  
The provided conversation history indicates that no tool calls were invoked by the model ('tool_calls': None throughout the dataset). Therefore, the required API call was not executed, rendering Objective 2 as a failure.  

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically deemed a failure. Accordingly, the final user instruction of converting JPY to EUR with an amount of 1000 was not fulfilled."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The expected API call required by the task was:  
  `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `""{\n \""city\"": \""London\""\n }""`.  
- However, there were no actual tool calls invoked by the model (as indicated by the absence of `""tool_calls""` in the provided data). Therefore, the model failed to execute the necessary API call.  
- Since attempting the required tool call to fulfill the task is mandatory and was not done, Objective 2 has failed.  
- Objective 3 is directly considered a failure due to the failure of Objective 2, as the task's requirement was not met, and no final answer was provided by the model."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**: For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```json

  ""name"": ""time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""base"": ""USD"",
    ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"",
    ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"",

The actual tool invoked by the model is:  
```json
{
  ""name"": ""Finish"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""
  }
}
```
The tool name does not match the required API call, and no attempt was made to use the expected API, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, the model cannot produce an appropriate answer based on the required API call data, and the final action only indicates giving up and restarting. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,6,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments:  
  ```
  {

- The tool invoked by the model is:  
  `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments:  
  ```
  {
    ""date"": ""2024-01-15""
  }
  ```
The arguments and the tool name match exactly with the required API call. Thus, Objective 2 is considered successful.  

For Objective 3:  
The model did not provide the final answer in its responses; instead, it finalized with the ""Finish"" function giving up and restarting. As a result, the user's instruction was not fulfilled. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."

        ""variable"": ""x""  
      }`  
    - **Actual Tool Calls**:  
      1. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",""variable"":""x""}` (Invoked two times)  
      2. The tool call `'Finish'` does not relate to the user's expected API but is an additional tool used to appropriately deliver the final answer. This is acceptable as per the guideline.  

    In this case, the required tool invocation `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` is made with the correct tool name and accurate arguments. Moreover, additional tools do not impact accuracy. Hence, **Objective 2 is successful.**  

- **Objective 3**:  
    - The final answer provided by the `'Finish'` tool call is:  
      `""The derivative of 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4x.""`  
    - This directly corresponds to the required differentiation operation with respect to variable `x` on the expression `2*x^2 + 3*y + 1`. The answer fully derives from API data processing \( \text{(Output \(4x\) is directly from the differentiation)} \), achieving the user's instruction.  
      
    Since the final answer fulfills the user's request and is based on data retrieved from the API calls, **Objective 3 is successful.**"
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,7,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The model invoked the required tool call as 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with arguments '{""sdate"":""2020-01-01"",""edate"":""2020-12-31"",""ticker"":""TSLA""}', which matches exactly the required API call '{""name"": ""yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete"", ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""sdate\"": \""2020-01-01\"",\n \""edate\"": \""2020-12-31\"",\n \""ticker\"": \""TSLA\""\n }""}'. As all required arguments match and no mistakes are observed in spelling, Objective 2 is considered a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model did not proceed to provide a final answer, as no returned `""give_answer""` object or final response is observed. Instead, the invoked `""Finish""` tool indicated a failure in progressing (e.g., communicating unauthorized error issues or asking for additional confirmation but not achieving the final task). Therefore, Objective 3 is considered a failure because the user's instruction was not completed."
