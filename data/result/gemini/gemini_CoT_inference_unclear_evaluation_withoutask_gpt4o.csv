1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails as the required tool call with proper arguments was not made. Furthermore, analysis of the conversation shows that the model did not provide a final answer but rather conveyed giving up through the 'Finish' tool, which does not achieve the user's instruction in any way."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  **'search_for_netflix_v2'** with arguments '{""query"": ""\'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\'""}'.  
- The tool call made by the model is:  
  **'search_for_netflix_v2'** with arguments '{""limit_titles"":1,""query"":""star wars""}'.  

There are discrepancies in the argument values, specifically:  
   - The required `query` value is `""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""`, while the model's call used `""star wars""`, which is a much broader term and does not match exactly the specific title required.  
   - The additional argument `""limit_titles"":1` in the model's call is permissible but doesn't compensate for the inaccuracy in the `""query""` value.  
  
Hence, the actual tool call does not align with the required API call, leading to failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The model did not provide a valid final answer, having instead invoked a secondary tool (`Finish`) to ""give up and restart,"" **without fulfilling the user's instruction** (i.e., no final answer was provided about the specific title query for the required ""Star Wars"" movie).  
Moreover, since Objective 2 already failed, Objective 3 is also a failure as correctness of the retrieved/delivered information relies on the tool call accuracy. Hence, both objectives fail."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is defined as:  
```
{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{ ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023"" }'}  
```  

The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
```
{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{""date1"":""12-01-2022"",""date2"":""12-31-2022""}'}  
```  

The tool name matches in this case (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`), but the required arguments have incorrect ""date1"" and ""date2"" values. The required arguments specify the year **2023**, whereas the actual tool invocation specifies the incorrect year **2022**. As the argument values must match exactly (considering their critical semantic relevance in this case), the tool call fails to meet the requirements. Due to this mismatch, Objective 2 fails.  

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as per the evaluation guidelines. Furthermore, although the response provides drawing details, these details are incorrect for the requested date range (December 2023) and instead correspond to December 2022. As such, it fails to fulfill the user's instruction."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,6,Success,Success,Failure,"- The expected API call is:  
  `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with arguments `{ ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"" }`.

- The tools invoked by the model are:
  - Tool call 1: `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with arguments `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`
  - Tool call 2: `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with arguments `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`
  - Tool call 3: `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with arguments `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`.

All required tool calls were invoked with the correct tool name and arguments. The model's invocation of multiple instances of the required tool call does not affect correctness. Thus, objective 1 is a success.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
The model did not arrive at a final answer (`give_answer` key and `final_answer` are absent). Instead, the output included discussion about incomplete responses and restarting without providing a fulfillment of the user's original instructions. This behavior means the objective of finalizing the user's request was not achieved. As per the rules, the absence of a final answer implies failure for Objective 3."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"":""2022-12-18""}`. The actual tool call made by the model was `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"":""2022-12-18""}`. Both the tool name and argument match the expected tool call, making this a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The final answer was not provided by the model as the process terminated with the ""Finish"" tool call and chose to ""give up and restart"". Since the user's instruction to get the scores for the specified date was not fulfilled and no final answer was provided, this is a failure."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
1. **Objective 2**: The required API call is:  
   ```
   'search_for_jsearch' with arguments '{ ""query"": ""teaching in London"" }'  
   ```
   However, the actual tools invoked by the model include multiple calls, none of which matches this required API call.  
   - The model made the following **actual tool calls**:  
     - `search_for_jsearch` with `{""country"":""gb"",""query"":""professional jobs in London""}`
     - `search_for_jsearch` with `{""country"":""gb"",""language"":""en"",""query"":""professional jobs in london""}`  
     - `search_for_jsearch` with `{""country"":""us"",""query"":""teaching job in New York""}`
   These arguments do not align with the expected API call (`query: ""teaching in London""`), as none of them focus on the query `""teaching in London""`. Furthermore, additional metadata like `country` and `language` were included, but these are acceptable as per the guidelines only if the ""query"" is correct?îwhich it is not in this case.  

   As the required API (call with `""teaching in London""`) was never invoked, **Objective 2 is a failure.**

2. **Objective 3**: As per the rules, if Objective 2 fails, we directly infer **Objective 3 is also a failure.**"
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
  - The expected API call is:  
    - Tool name: `search_for_jsearch`  
    - Arguments: `{""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York""}`  
  - The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
    1. Tool name: `search_for_jsearch`, Arguments: `{""query"":""engineering jobs in New York""}`  
    2. Tool name: `search_for_jsearch`, Arguments: `{""query"":""engineering jobs in New York""}`  
    3. Tool name: `search_for_jsearch`, Arguments: `{""num_pages"":1,""query"":""engineering jobs in New York""}`  
  - The tool name is correct across the actual tool calls, but the argument `{""query"":""engineering jobs in New York""}` and `{""num_pages"":1,""query"":""engineering jobs in New York""}` differs significantly from the expected argument `{""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York""}`. The intended query's focus (""mechanical engineer in New York"") is altered to a more generic query for ""engineering jobs in New York,"" which does not match the meaning. Thus, **Objective 2 is a failure.**  
  
- **Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
  - Since Objective 2 is a failure (tool calls did not execute correctly based on the expected input), the model could not rely on the correct API responses to form a valid final answer, and the model provided no valid answer.  
  - Additionally, no final answer has been generated for the task. This alone results in **Objective 3 failing to meet expectations.**"
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- The model made the following tool calls:  
  1. `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments: `{""query"":""Ronaldo Lu√≠s""}`  

- The required API calls were:
  1. `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments: `{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}`
  2. `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments: `{""is_id"": 3140}`  

- In comparing the tool calls, the first tool call has a mismatch between the arguments. The required argument is `{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}`, but the actual model call used `{""query"":""Ronaldo Lu√≠s""}`, which is different (not a close semantic match but rather includes an additional identifier that adds uncertainty).  

- Additionally, the second required API call (`players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with required arguments `{""is_id"": 3140}`) was not invoked at all by the model.  

As a result, the failure to invoke all required API calls renders **Objective 2 a failure**. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly fails as well because a relevant final answer cannot be achieved if the correct tools weren?ôt used. Additionally, the final answer was not provided, emphasizing the incompatibility with Objective 3."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `search_filters_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""country"":""us"",""query"":""professional jobs in New York""}` and `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which are both not required APIs based on the prompt. Furthermore, the required API call (`estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`) was not invoked at all. For this reason, Objective 2 is a failure. As for Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, we directly classify Objective 3 as a failure. The model gave up and restarted without fulfilling the user's instruction, and there is no final useful answer."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected tool call is:  
`'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with arguments '{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }'`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
`'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with arguments '{""query"": ""Star Wars""}'` (repeated multiple times).  

These actual tools do not match the required tool call because the model searched for the general query ""Star Wars"" instead of the specific query ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" as required. The query string must match exactly. Thus, this leads to a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
As Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure?îsince the required API call was not successfully invoked, the final user instruction cannot be fulfilled. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer based on the data retrieved, which further solidifies the failure."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- The required API call is: `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with `{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`.  
- The actual tool invoked by the model is: `Finish` with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  
- The invoked tool name (`Finish`) is not the same as the required tool name (`get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure as well."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
- `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `{""season"": ""2020""}`  

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
- `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `{""season"": ""covid""}`  

The argument ""season"" does not match the expected value (""covid"" vs. ""2020""). Therefore, Objective 2 is failed.  

For Objective 3, as per the rules mentioned, if Objective 2 is a failure, then Objective 3 is also automatically a failure regardless of the provided final answer. Hence, Objective 3 also failed."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  

`{'name': 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data', 'arguments': '{ ""tournament_id"": ""650"" }'}`  

The tool call invoked by the model is:  

`{'function': {'arguments': '{""tournament_id"":12345}', 'name': 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'}}`  

Although the tool name `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` is correct, the argument `tournament_id` provided by the model is `12345`, which does not match the expected value of `""650""`. Hence, Objective 2 fails.
  
Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly consider Objective 3 as a failure as well. The model also does not provide any valid final answer or fulfill user instructions; instead, it chose to give up and restart, further confirming failure here."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  

The required API call is:  
- `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments:  
  `{  
    ""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"",  
    ""n_players"": ""10"",  
    ""category"": ""singles""  
  }`.  

The actual tool calls executed by the model are:  
- `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments:  
  `{""category"":""singles"",""n_players"":""10"",""timestamp"":""2024-02-26""}`.  

There is a mismatch in the `timestamp` argument between the expected (`2025-01-20`) and the actual (`2024-02-26`). As the argument values do not align correctly, the tool calls made by the model fail Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also directly fails. Additionally, while the model did provide a final answer describing the top 10 ATP rankings, the failure to use the correct data source (due to the incorrect API date parameter) means the final response did not fulfill the user's instruction based on accurate API data. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  - The actual tool call made by the model:  
    `{'name': 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{""category"":""returnpointswon1stserve"",""season"":""2012"",""surface"":""clay""}'}`
  - The required tool call:  
    `{'name': 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{\n  ""season"": ""2012"",\n  ""category"": ""return"",\n  ""surface"": ""clay""\n }'}`
  - Key differences:  
    1. The `category` parameter differs between the calls: `""returnpointswon1stserve""` in the actual call vs `""return""` in the required call. This mismatch fails the expected requirement.
  - Since the required API call is not correctly executed, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- For Objective 3:  
  - No final answer was derived that fulfills the user's instruction. Additionally, since Objective 2 failed, the necessary data was not retrieved to even attempt completing the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 also fails."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,10,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
- **Tools invoked by the model:** `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `'{""base"":""RMB"",""to"":""GBP""}'`. 
- **Required API calls:** `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `'{""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP""}'`.  
- Comparison: The tool call made by the model matches exactly with the required API call, including tool name and arguments. Hence, Objective 2 is a **success**.

**Objective 3:**  
- The model did not provide a final answer (`'give_answer'` is not present in the conversation trace), and it mentioned that the API call failed. Additionally, no response was generated to fulfill the user's instruction. This implies that the user's instruction was not achieved, resulting in **failure** for Objective 3."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Tools invoked by the model**:  
  1. `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `{""username"":""jack""}`  

- **Expected tool call**:  
  1. `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`  

  The tool name matches the expected one, but the argument values do not. The username in the model's tool call is `""jack""`, which is incorrect, as it should have been `""the_beautyofcinema""`. This discrepancy means the model fails to meet the requirements for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure (the necessary API call was not invoked with the correct arguments), we can infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the model's final answer pertains to the TikTok profile of a user named ""jack,"" which does not fulfill the user requirement due to inaccurate username inputs."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`.  
2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`.  
3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`.  

The model actually invoked only one tool:   
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TASLA""}`.  

While the tool name `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` matches one of the required tools, the argument `""symbol"": ""TASLA""` is incorrect as it does not match `""symbol"": ""TSLA""`. Additionally, the other two required tools, `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` and `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'`, were never invoked at all. Thus, Objective 2 fails.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model discarded the task by invoking the tool `'Finish'` with arguments indicating it chose to ""give up and restart,"" never providing the required final answer to the user's instruction."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
- `{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"":""Janover""}'}`
- The model also called the `Finish` function to indicate giving up.  

The required API calls are:  
1. `{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{ ""symbol"": ""JNVR"" }'}`
2. `{'name': 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{ ""symbol"": ""JNVR"" }'}`
3. `{'name': 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{ ""symbol"": ""JNVR"" }'}`  

The discrepancies are as follows:  
- While the tool name `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` matches with one of the required tools, the argument for `symbol` differs (`""symbol"":""Janover""` was provided instead of `""symbol"":""JNVR""`). This difference in content does not align semantically or conceptually as required by the task.  
- Additionally, the model failed to invoke the other two required tools: `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` and `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2`.  
These errors resulted in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
The model's process led it to call a `Finish` function indicating giving up, and no final answer or response was provided to fulfill the user's instruction. Since Objective 2 failed (incorrect/incomplete tool usage), offloading data from inadequate inputs invalidates Objective 3 automatically. By default, absence of a final answer additionally ensures this is a failure."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"The tool invoked by the model is:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"":""NVDA""}`  

The required API call is:  
- `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{ ""symbol"": ""NVDA"" }`  

The tool name and required argument match exactly between the model-invoked tool and the expected API call, indicating it is a success for Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
```
""Based on the provided data, NVIDIA's (NVDA) index trend shows a PE ratio of 17.75 and a PEG ratio of 1.38. Growth estimates indicate a 5% growth in the current quarter (0q), 12% growth in the next quarter (+1q), 2% growth this year (0y), 12% growth next year (+1y), and 11% growth over the next 5 years (+5y). Note that this data may be for the S\\u0026P 500 (SP5) and not directly for NVDA. More specific data for NVDA is needed for a complete analysis.""
```

The final response is coherent with the retrieved data ensuring its dependency on the API call (`stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`) for NVIDIA's (NVDA) symbol information. Consequently, the user's instruction for analyzing NVDA's index trend information is successfully achieved based on API results, satisfying Objective 3."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"`{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""symbol"": ""DJR""\n }'}`  

The tool invoked by the model is:  
`{'name': 'stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"":""DJIA""}'}`  

The tool name is different (""stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" vs expected ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2""). The argument ""symbol"" is also different (""DJIA"" used by the model vs ""DJR"" expected). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure as per the evaluation guidelines.  

Reason: The tool invoked by the model did not match the required tool name or the required argument. Hence, Objective 2 failed, and consequently, Objective 3 failed as well."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with the argument `{""symbol"": ""META""}`. However, the model invoked `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with the argument `{""symbol"": ""FB""}`.  
The symbol ""META"" represents the company known as Meta Platforms, while ""FB"" (the former ticker symbol for Meta Platforms) is not semantically the same due to the update. Since the required arguments are not matched with the actual tools invoked, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer'` does not appear in the text, and a ""give up and restart"" response was chosen). Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also directly fails. Therefore, the failure to use the correct API results in not fulfilling the user's instruction, further confirming Objective 3 failure."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments: `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`.
- The model invoked `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments: `{""channel"": ""shadoune kane""}`.  
- The argument `""channel""` does not match between the actual tool call and the required API call. (""shadoune kane"" is different from ""shadoune666""). Therefore, it is a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure as the model's execution does not align with the user's intended instruction. Further, there is no final answer provided in the logs."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",12,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required API call was `video_details_for_tiktok_api` with arguments `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`.  
However, there were no actual tool calls made by the model (`'tool_calls'` is `None`). Thus, the expected tool call was not executed, leading to a failure in Objective 2.  
As Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure by default since the model failed to retrieve data to respond to the user's requirements. Moreover, the model did not provide a final answer (`""give_answer""` did not appear), further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:

Since the arguments do not match with all the required parameters from the expected API call, the model fails Objective 2.

-----Objective 3:-----  
If Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Therefore, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also marked as a failure.

26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,5,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:

27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments: `{""base"":""USD"",""end_date"":""2024-07-24"",""start_date"":""2023-07-24"",""symbols"":""XAU""}`  

The required API calls were:  
1. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments: `{
  ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"",
  ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"",
  ""base"": ""USD"",
  ""symbols"": ""XAU""
}`  
2. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments: `{
  ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"",
  ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"",
  ""base"": ""USD"",
  ""symbols"": ""XPT""
}`  

The second expected call relating to the `'symbols': 'XPT'` was missing entirely; thus, the required API calls were not fully addressed. Furthermore, the actual arguments of the first API call do not match the expected arguments (e.g., `start_date` is different: `""2023-07-24""` instead of `""2022-12-01""` and `end_date` is different: `""2024-07-24""` instead of `""2022-12-20""`). Therefore, the model failed to successfully perform all required calls with correct arguments, making Objective 2 fail.  

For Objective 3:  
As the model failed Objective 2, it implies that the correct data was not retrieved to generate a proper final answer. Furthermore, the model did not provide a satisfactory final answer under `""give_answer""`. Instead, the decision was `""give up and restart""`, which means the user's instruction was not achieved. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`  
2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`  
3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`

The model invoked only one relevant tool call:  
1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SILY""}`  

The argument `""symbol"": ""SILY""` does not match the expected `""symbol"": ""SYNX""`; hence, the call is incorrect. In addition, the two other required API calls (`'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` and `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'`) were not invoked at all. Therefore, the Objective 2 failed.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, it is directly inferred that Objective 3 also fails as the user's instruction could not possibly have been fulfilled. Furthermore, the model, instead of directly solving the task, invoked the `""Finish""` API to ""give up and restart,"" indicating that it was unable to complete the required task."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls were calls to `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{ ""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"" }` and `{ ""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT"" }`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was to `'historical_rates_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""date"": ""2024-01-22"", ""symbols"": ""XAU,XPT"" }`. The tool invoked does not match the required tool (`'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` vs. `'historical_rates_for_metals_prices_rates_api'`), and the arguments do not align either (different date range and symbols). Therefore, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also a failure by inference. While the final answer provided information about ""gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT)"" rates, it was based on an incorrect API call and unrelated to the required date range. Thus, the instruction was not fulfilled correctly."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**:  
   - **Tools invoked by the model**:  
     - `'market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance'` with arguments `{""query"":""iShares FTSE A50 China Index ETF(02823)""}`
     - `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  
   - **Required API calls**:  
     - `'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'` with arguments `{ ""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823"" }`  

   Upon inspection, the model did not invoke the required tool call?î`market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance`?îwith the specified arguments for obtaining the required price chart data. While the model attempted to retrieve some information using the tool `'market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance'`, it abruptly decided to call the `'Finish'` function with a ""give up and restart"" action, meaning the additional required tool call (`market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance`) to fulfill the user's request was never made. As a result, **Objective 2 fails**.  

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - Because Objective 2 fails and the required API call was never made, the final data necessary to fulfill the user's request (retrieving the price chart data for the China Index over a year) was not obtained. Moreover, no final answer was provided to accomplish the user's instruction. Therefore, **Objective 3 fails**."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call was `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}`. However, the model invoked `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date"": ""08-08-2024""}`. The `date` argument differs and does not match the required value. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model does not successfully fulfill the user's requirement, and there is no valid final answer provided."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
   - **Actual Tool Call Invoked by the Model**:  
     Tool Name: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`  
     Arguments: `{""date1"":""07-01-2024"",""date2"":""07-31-2024""}`
   - **Required Tool Call**:  
     Tool Name: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`  
     Arguments: `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`
   - The required tool call was not invoked correctly because of a mismatch in the argument values for `date1` and `date2`. These are specific date ranges, and the actual tool call provided `07-01-2024` to `07-31-2024` instead of the required `12-01-2023` to `12-31-2023`. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.

- **Objective 3**:  
   - The model did not provide a valid final answer based on the tool calls. Although it invoked the tool `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`, this invocation used incorrect parameters and could not retrieve appropriate data. Additionally, the follow-up action suggests the model chose to give up and restart (`{""response"":""chose to give up and restart""}`). Since the user's instruction was not fulfilled and no final answer aligned with the requirements was given, Objective 3 also fails."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,12,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```python
{'name': 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""variables"": """",\n  ""values"": """",\n  ""expression"": ""5+10""\n}'}  
```  
However, there are no actual tool calls invoked by the model in the given transcript (`'tool_calls': None` is present throughout), meaning the model did not use or attempt the required tool call. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

2. For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure (no required tool calls were executed), we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the model did not provide a final answer fulfilling the user's instruction during the interaction and failed to utilize any API calls to compute the value (it repeated assertions and queries instead of leveraging the tools or resolving the task); thus, the user?ôs requirement was not achieved."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""ids"": ""44196397,155659213"" }'`.  
However, the actual tool call invoked by the model is `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""username"":""Michael Lee""}'`.  
The model used the wrong tool name (`user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` instead of `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`), and the arguments are unrelated to the ones required.  
Thus, the model failed to invoke the proper expected tools, making Objective 2 a failure.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred to be a failure as well. Additionally, the model did not provide the final answer (it gave up and restarted), which further confirms Objective 3's failure."
35,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation in the most famous island of the USA and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- Expected tool calls:  
  1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments: `{'q': 'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'}`  
  2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments: `{'q': 'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'}`  
- Actual tool calls executed by the model:  
  1. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments: `{'q': 'most famous island in the USA'}`  
  2. `Finish` with arguments: `{'return_type': 'give_up_and_restart'}`  

The model executed incorrect tools and did not invoke either of the required API calls. The expected `search_image_for_google_search_json` was never invoked. Additionally, the one executed `search_web_for_google_search_json` did not provide the correct query as specified in the required API calls. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
The model produced no final answer and explicitly ended the sequence with a tool (`Finish`) indicating it ""chose to give up and restart,"" which means the user's instruction to search for images and forecasts related to Hawaii island was not fulfilled. Moreover, as Objective 2 failed due to missed and incorrect API calls, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well."
36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The model did not provide a final answer. Instead, it used an unnecessary tool `'Finish'` with argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}` and did not fulfill the user's instruction. Additionally, since Objective 2 already failed, Objective 3 is a failure as well."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API call is: `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""jackie"" }`.  
- The tools invoked by the model are:  
  1. `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""username"":""jackiechan""}`  
  2. `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""username"":""jackiechan""}`  
- The argument `""username""` in the actual tool calls is `""jackiechan""` instead of `""jackie""` as required. This mismatch in argument values causes the Objective 2 to fail.  
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is a failure as well. Thus, the model fails to achieve the user's instruction based on the API data."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:   
- Actual tool calls by the model:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""EGY""}`  
  2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  
- Expected tool calls:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`  

The model did not match the required invocation for either tool. It called the `country_details_for_referential_db` tool with an incorrect argument, using `""countrycode"":""EGY""` instead of `""countryCode"":""NG""`. Furthermore, it does not invoke the `states_for_referential_db` tool, which was also expected in the required API calls. Since the model fails to execute all required API calls accurately, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
The model did not provide a final answer but instead invoked the `Finish` tool with `""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""`, indicating that it gave up on fulfilling the user's request. Since Objective 2 also failed (no accurate or complete API data retrieval for the provided instructions), Objective 3 is directly inferred to fail based on these considerations."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",12,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the required API calls were:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""UA"" }`  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""UA"" }`.  
  
  However, no tool calls were actually invoked by the model as per the provided transcript. This means the required API calls were completely missing, thus failing Objective 2.

- For Objective 3, because Objective 2 failed (no tool calls made to retrieve information), the user's instruction of identifying the poorest country in Europe and gathering its capital, region, currency, and the list of states and their coordinates was not achieved. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- **Tools actually invoked by the model:**  
  - `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""QAT""}`
  - `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""MY""}`
  - `'Finish'` with arguments `{""final_answer"":""Based on the available data...""}`  

- **Required API calls:**  
  - `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`
  - `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`  

While the first required tool `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}` was essentially invoked (with some allowance for case differences in argument keys), the second required API call `'states_for_referential_db'` for retrieving the states was **never invoked** by the model. Thus, the set of API calls is incomplete, leading to a **failure** for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure?îindicating incomplete data collection?îthe final answer cannot have been derived based on **all** required tool calls. Moreover, the output explicitly mentions that it lacks data on Malaysian states (""I do not have access to a comprehensive list of Malaysian states with their latitude and longitude coordinates""), signaling that the user's instruction has not been fully achieved. This results in a **failure** for Objective 3 as well."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls are:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  

However, the model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""IND""}`  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

Upon comparison:  
- The spelling for the argument `""countryCode""` is expected to be `""countryCode"": ""IN""`, but the model provided `""countrycode"": ""IND""`, which is both improperly cased and has incorrect values. This makes the tool call invalid. Additionally, the second required API call `'states_for_referential_db'` was missing entirely.  

As Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed because achieving the user's instruction would require valid and complete API tool calls that were not made. Furthermore, the model's final output communicates a decision to ""give up and restart,"" which confirms that the user requirement was not fulfilled."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,10,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For **Objective 2**, the required API call specifies the tool name as `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments containing `{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}`. The actual tool invoked by the model is `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with the arguments `{""limit"": 5, ""query"": ""intimate restaurants in New York City""}`. While the tool name itself is correct, the `query` argument has a significant mismatch. The required `query` asks for `""restaurants, NY, USA""`, while the model's query specifies `""intimate restaurants in New York City""`, which is narrower and deviates semantically. Additionally, the actual API call includes an extra parameter, `""limit"": 5`, which affects neither accuracy nor correctness per the specification. However, the essential mismatch in the natural language and semantic intention of the query makes this a **failure** for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, failing Objective 2 already guarantees a failure for Objective 3. Moreover, the model explicitly states the API call failed due to a subscription error and doesn't retrieve or attempt to form a response based on the data it intended to get from the API. As such, the final answer does not achieve the user's instruction, and no attempt was made to craft an alternative response. This makes Objective 3 a **failure** as well."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
1. `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"":""most recent movie directed by Castille Landon""}`

The available tools did not provide sufficient information to fulfill your request. Please try again with a different query or provide more details."",""return_type"":""give_answer""}`  

The required tools and their arguments are:  

1. `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{\n  ""q"": ""After Everything""\n }`  
2. `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{\n  ""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""\n }`  

Comparison: The model invoked the first tool `get_id_for_similar_movies`, but the argument provided (`""most recent movie directed by Castille Landon""`) is incorrect as it does not match the required query (`""After Everything""`). Additionally, the second required tool `find_similar_for_similar_movies` was never invoked. Therefore, the model fails to meet the required API calls.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Objective 2 already failed, which means the model did not achieve the required API calls. Furthermore, the final answer explicitly states that the model did not fulfill the user's request due to insufficient data from the tools. No valid dataset retrieved from any required tool was referenced in forming the final answer."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  

- The model invoked the tool `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments: `{""q"":""most recent movie played by Jason Momoa""}`.  
- The expected API call provided was `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments: `{""q"": ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'""}`.  
- The argument `""q""` from the actual tool invocation is semantically different from the required argument, which specifically expects `""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'""`. The phrase `""most recent movie played by Jason Momoa""` does not clearly match the intended specificity of the expected call, leading to a failure.  

For Objective 3:  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, the correct data to generate the answer is not obtained, and no final answer response is given by the model. This results in a direct failure for Objective 3."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
- The required tool call was:

- The actual tool call made by the model was:  
  `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{""day"": 1, ""month"": 1}`.  
- The arguments provided in the actual tool call are incorrect compared to the required arguments. The required date was ""July 27"" (`""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""`), but the model used ""January 1"" (`""month"": ""1"", ""day"": ""1""`).
- Since Objective 2 failed (model made an incorrect API call with unmatched arguments), Objective 3 is also considered a failure, as the model's final answer cannot be verified to be based on the correct retrieved data."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",10,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

Objective 2:

- **Comparison**:
  1. The model used a different tool name (`'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`) compared to the expected `'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`. The names appear semantically related but not consistent.
  2. The expected `start` argument `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""` is mismatched with the actual `start` argument `""2024-05-01T00:00:00""`.
  3. The actual API call includes additional arguments like `end` (`""2024-05-31T23:59:59""`) and `gran` (`""1d""`) which are not part of the expected arguments. However, the mismatched and incorrect arguments remain the primary reason.

Due to the inaccurate alignment of the tool name and arguments, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 already failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, so even independently, Objective 3 would fail."

The required second and third tools with expressions `15*x^4 + 8*x^3` and `60*x^3 + 24*x^2` were *never invoked* by the model. Only the tool for the first required arguments matches the actual tool call, so the expected workflow was incomplete. This results in a **failure for Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**, since the expected second and third API calls were never successfully made, it follows that the final answer couldn't have fulfilled the user's instruction completely or been derived correctly from the API data. Furthermore, there is no explicit final provided answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer'` does not appear in the given data). This results in a **failure for Objective 3**."

1. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`  
2. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`  

The actual tool calls by the model:  
1. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`  

The second required tool call (to differentiate `5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3` with respect to `b`) is entirely missing. Thus, the model has not invoked all the expected tool calls, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, as Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure by rule since the required information to formulate the final answer was not fully obtained from the API calls."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,11,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For **Objective 2**, the required API call was `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with the arguments `'{ ""city"": ""London"" }'`. However, the model invoked `'get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with the arguments `'{ ""lat"": 51, ""lon"": 0 }'`. The invoked tool does not match the required tool name, nor does it achieve the same purpose. Therefore, the outcome is a **failure for Objective 2**. As for **Objective 3**, because **Objective 2** failed (the required tool was not invoked, and the data integration is invalid), **Objective 3** automatically failed. The model did not base its output on the required API call and made simulated data unrelated to the actual API outputs."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The actual tool call made by the model was:  
  ```  
  'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{""username"":""james""}'  
  ```  
  The required tool call was:  
  ```  
  'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{\n  ""username"": ""KingJames""\n  }'  
  ```  
  The tool name matches; however, the argument `username` does not match?îthe required username is `KingJames`, while the model invoked the tool with `james`. Since the arguments do not match exactly, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

- **Objective 3**: Since **Objective 2 failed**, we can directly infer that the model's final answer , even though provided, was not retrieved based on the correct required API call. Thus, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
