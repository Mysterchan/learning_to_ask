Please provide the following:\n\n1. **Starting location:**  What is the starting point of the delivery route (e.g., address, coordinates)?\n2. **Destination locations:** What are the addresses or coordinates of all the delivery destinations?\n3. **Delivery constraints (optional):** Are there any time windows, weight restrictions, or other constraints that need to be considered?  (e.g., specific delivery times, maximum weight per stop)\n4. **Distance/Time Metric:** Should the route optimization prioritize distance or travel time?  What units should be used (e.g., miles, kilometers, minutes, hours)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can attempt to use the SQUAKE API to calculate the optimal route.\n",
