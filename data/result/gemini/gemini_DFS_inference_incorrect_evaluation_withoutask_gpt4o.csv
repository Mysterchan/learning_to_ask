1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{""trackingnumber"":"".YT9999999999""}'`
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'` (invoked twice).  

The required API calls are:  
1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""\n}'`
2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""\n}'`.  

The tool `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` was invoked, but the argument `""trackingNumber""` does not match the required value. The actual argument was `{ ""trackingnumber"": "".YT9999999999"" }`, which is both semantically wrong and incorrectly formatted, as the number does not match the expected one (""YT2003521266065328""). Furthermore, the required `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` tool was **not** invoked at all. Hence, the Objective 2 fails.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 fails due to the essential tools not being invoked and the tracking operation not being executed properly, the model cannot fulfill the task of tracking the specified number. Additionally, the final answer indirectly reflects failure as it mentions giving up and restarting without completing the task; no final answer based on appropriate tool invocations was provided. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
- Expected tool calls:  
  1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`
  2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`.

- Actual tool calls made by the model:  
  1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990"" }`.
  2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990"" }`.

While the correct tools were invoked (`packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` and `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`), the primary argument (`trackingnumber`) is incorrect?”the models used `""NY9999999990""` instead of the required `""YT2003521266065328""`. This discrepancy fails to meet the requirements for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 immediately fails, as the incorrect input arguments prevent achieving the user's instruction accurately. Additionally, the final answer (`""Based on the tracking number NY9999999990, the possible carriers...""`) was based on incorrect input tracking numbers and therefore does not fulfill the user's original request properly."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,1065,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
  - **Tools actually called by the model:**  
    1. `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""1053012309"" }`.  
  - **Expected API Calls:**  
    1. `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""1053012308"" }`.  
    2. `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""1053012308"" }`.  
  - **Analysis:**  
    - The actual tool name `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` matches closely with the expected `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store`. However, the argument `is_id` should have been `""1053012308""` but was incorrectly `""1053012309""`.  
    - The tool call for `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` was completely missing.
    - As the argument mismatch and tool omission diverge from expected calls, the objective fails.

- **Objective 3:**  
  - Due to the failure of Objective 2 and the absence of a valid final answer addressing the user instruction, Objective 3 is a failure. The model attempted one API call, identified that the app ID 1053012309 was not found, and essentially restarted without producing the required result."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}`.   
However, the tool invoked by the model is `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-10-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-01-2023""}`. The order of arguments' values in the actual API call is inverted relative to the required parameters. Date ranges like these are critical (start date vs. end date), therefore it fails for Objective 2.  
  
For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can infer that Objective 3 also fails as the model's answer may not be based on valid tool outputs due to the incorrect invocation."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"The model invoked the tool `'get_address_transaction_webhook_for_address_monitor'` instead of `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'`. While the argument key name `""transactionid""` closely resembles expecting a monitor address ID, it differs from the required `""monitorAddressId""` key, and critically, the actual value `0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F` does not match the expected `""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""`. Mismatching function names further cement this failure.

---

**Objective 3**: Failure  
**Reason**:  
Since the tool invocation in Objective 2 failed, and the error from the tool was deemed unrecoverable by the model, the user's request to retrieve transactions was left unfulfilled. Additionally, the conversation looped back to generic assistance messages without returning any final answer. This shows the user's instruction was not achieved, invalidating Objective 3 as well."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The expected tool calls are:
1. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments:
   ```

2. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments:
   ```
   {
     ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""

The actual tool calls made by the model are:
1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments:
   ```
   {
     ""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""

   ```
   {
     ""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""
   }
   ```
3. Two calls to a `Finish` function, none of which are part of the required tool calls.

The arguments provided by the model differ significantly from the required arguments. Specifically, the IP address `288.288.288.288` is different from the required value `8.8.8.8`. Moreover, the model does not attempt to invoke the required tool `legacy_v1_for_blackbox`. This results in the failure of Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the model did not execute the appropriate tool calls to fulfill the user's instruction. Additionally, the model fails to provide a final descriptive answer to the user and instead uses the `Finish` function with a response such as ?œchose to give up and restart.??This shows that the model did not achieve the user's instruction based on API-derived data or independently."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",1161,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required API calls are:  
1. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
2. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

The model only invoked the following actual tool calls:  
1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""}`  

The differences are:  
- The first required API call (`legacy_v1_for_blackbox`) was not invoked at all, which directly makes the Objective 2 fail.  
- For the second API call, although the correct tool (`singular_object_v2_for_blackbox`) was invoked, the argument is incorrect (`288.288.288.288` instead of `8.8.8.8`) because the real IP being checked does not match the required input.

Due to Objective 2's failure, we directly infer Objective 3 also fails because the required API call arguments were incorrect, and the model gave a final output stating that it ""gave up and restarted."" Since the correct tool calls necessary to resolve the query were not made, the task was not successfully addressed."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",1161,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **For Objective 2**, the required API calls are:  
  1. `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with `{'is_id': '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'}`  
  2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with `{'is_id': '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'}`  
  3. `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with `{'is_id': '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model consist of:  
1. `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with `{'is_id': '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2'}` and  
2. `'Finish'` with `{'return_type': 'give_up_and_restart'}`.  

From the comparison, one of the required API calls (`'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'`) is invoked by the model, but the `is_id` argument provided (`'6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2'`) does not match the required value (`'2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'`). Furthermore, the remaining required API calls:  
- `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` and  
- `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` are completely missing.  
These discrepancies make Objective 2 fail.

- **For Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, it's impossible for the final response to rely on the data from the required API calls. Additionally, the model's response suggests it decided to give up and restart, thus no final answer was derived to fulfill the user's original instructions explicitly. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",1065,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are:  
    1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{\n  ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""\n }'`  
    2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{\n  ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""\n }'`
  
  The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
    1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{""is_id"":""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'`  
    2. `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{""is_id"":""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'`
  
  Analyzing the tool calls:  
  - The tool name `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` matches with one of the required tool names. However, its required parameter `""is_id""` does not match. The required `""is_id""` value is `""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`, whereas the actual value is `""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""`. Therefore, this API call is incorrect.
  - The model made an additional API call, `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'`, which is not part of the expected calls.
  - The required call `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` was not invoked at all.  

  Since not all the required API calls were made successfully, **Objective 2 fails**.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 has failed, we infer that Objective 3 must also fail, as it cannot independently succeed when the required tools weren't correctly called. Moreover, the model did not provide an appropriate final answer to fulfill the user's instruction. The model eventually gave error messages as reasons for not being able to proceed, instead of fully addressing the user's query. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model only invoked `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` with arguments `{""channelname"":""mr.besst""}`, which has a spelling error in the `channelname` argument. The required tool call is `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` with arguments `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`, where the `channelname` argument is correct and essential for finding the required channel ID. Hence, the model failed to correctly execute this expected tool call. Additionally, the model did not invoke the required `channel_details_for_youtube_search` tool call with arguments `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`. Since the required API calls were not correctly executed, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3, as Objective 2 already fails, we can directly infer that the correct final answer could not have been achieved, indicating a failure for Objective 3 as well. Additionally, the response logs show that the model gave up without achieving the user's instructions (refers to ""chose to give up and restart""), further corroborating the failure to achieve Objective 3."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call is `{'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{\n  ""email"": ""test@gmail.com""\n }'}`, but the model invoked the tool `{'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{""email"":""testing.com""}'}`. The argument for the `email` parameter is different?”the expected email is `test@gmail.com`, whereas the actual email is `testing.com`. Since the tool call does not meet the expected arguments, Objective 2 is considered a failure. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure due to the rule that if Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 cannot succeed."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2:** The required API call was:  
   - Tool name: `age_calculator_for_age_calculator`
   - Argument: `{ ""date"": ""19870630"" }`  

   The model invoked the tool:  
   - Tool name: `age_calculator_for_age_calculator`
   - Argument: `{ ""date"": ""99999999"" }`  

   While the tool name matches, the argument value for ""date"" provided in the actual call (`""99999999""`) does not match the expected value (`""19870630""`). The provided value is invalid and thus the tool call does not fulfill the requirement. Hence, Objective 2 is a **failure**.

2. **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, according to the evaluation rules, Objective 3 is automatically a **failure** as well. Moreover, the final answer is absent, as the system resorts to looping and retry mechanisms without providing any conclusive response to the user's instructions. Thus, the user's instruction is not achieved."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,1161,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- **Model's actual tool calls:**  
  1. Tool name: `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2`  
     Parameters: `{ ""relatedtovideoid"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""type"": ""video"", ""maxresults"": 5 }`  

  2. Tool name: `Finish`  
     Parameters: `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`  

- **Expected API calls:**  
  1. Tool name: `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2`  
     Parameters: `{ ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video"" }`  
  2. Tool name: `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2`  
     Parameters: `{ ""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics"" }`  
  3. Tool name: `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`  
     Parameters: `{ ""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100"" }`  

- **Comparison:**  
   * For the required API call to `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2`, the actual tool call by the model uses `relatedtovideoid: ""5xxjJJKQ4y8""` instead of `7ghhRHRP6t4`. This mismatched argument makes the call invalid.  
   * The model did not invoke `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` or `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`, meaning some required API calls are completely missing.

### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason:**  
Objective 2 failed because the correct required APIs were not invoked (e.g., some APIs were missing or incorrectly structured). Furthermore, the model gave up and restarted using the `Finish` tool, without fulfilling the user's request or providing any relevant final response to the instruction, violating the task completion requirement."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,1066,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   

For Objective 2, examining the actual invoked tool calls by the model and comparing them with the required API calls:

1. **Required Tool Calls:**  
   - `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`
   - `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`

2. **Observed Tool Calls:**  
   - `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""maxresults"":""50"",""part"":""snippet,contentDetails"",""playlistid"":""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""}`
   - Many invocations of the `Finish` function, which were not requested in the required calls (these are unnecessary calls and irrelevant to meeting the requirement). Additional irrelevant tool calls include `search_for_youtube_v3_v2` and multiple usage cycles following retries.

The arguments seen in the actual call to `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` (`""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""` vs the required `""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`) are mismatched. Therefore, the required semantics and arguments were not honored. The `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` tool was not at all invoked by the model. Due to incomplete/incorrect fulfillment concerning the expected calls, Objective 2 is a *failure*.  

For Objective 3, since the required tools and their functionality were not correctly employed, the model could not provide the user's requested output based on valid data retrieved from API responses. Furthermore, the final answer essentially devolved into continuously awaiting user input for a ""valid playlist ID"" instead of improving strategies to fulfill the original query, further underscoring failure in achieving the user's intent. Thus, Objective 3 is also a *failure*."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected tool calls were:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{ ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }'`  
2. `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{ ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }'`.  

The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{ ""limit"":100,""user_id"":""987654321"" }'`.  
2. `'Finish'` with argument `'{ ""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"" }'`.  

Issues: 
- The `user_id` argument in the actual tool call for `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` does not match the required `user_id`. The required value was `""96479162""` but the model used `""987654321""`. This makes the tool call incompatible with the intended API requirements.  
- The expected call to `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` was missing entirely.  

Thus, the model failed to invoke the necessary tools correctly.

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 has already been marked as a failure, we directly conclude Objective 3 is a failure as well. Furthermore, the final answer (`'give_up_and_restart'`) does not attempt to address the user's instruction regarding retrieving followers or likes and is unrelated to the required API calls."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `'user_details_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{ ""username"": ""omarmhaimdat"" }'`, but the actual tools invoked by the model were:

- `'search_for_twitter'` with arguments `'{""min_retweets"":100,""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA""}'`
- `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""final_answer"":""No tweets mentioning \\""XYZADRHSDFDA\\"" with at least 100 retweets were found."",""return_type"":""give_answer""}'`

Neither of these matches the required API call, either in tool name or argument structure. Thus, Objective 2 fails. According to the rules, when Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 can also be directly inferred as a failure irrespective of the model's final answer."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The required API call expects the `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` tool with the argument `'search': 'google.com'`. However, the API call made by the model wrongly invokes a tool with the name `invalid_hallucination_function_name` and the argument `'search': 'wikimania.net'`. Moreover, no actual invocation of the required tool `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` with the required argument took place. Since none of the required API calls were made correctly, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the model was unable to retrieve or use proper API data to formulate its final response. Furthermore, the model did not provide a final answer derived from an accurate API response but stated an invalid function understanding before returning generic assistant utterances and stated readiness. Therefore, Objective 3 also fails."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025?

The model invoked `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the arguments `{""date"":""2025-06-01""}`. The date in the required API call (`2024-06-01`) does not match the date used in the model's tool call (`2025-06-01`); this discrepancy makes it a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, the model did not provide a valid final answer to the user's request; instead, it later stated that its previous attempt failed, and restarted the interaction to ask general greetings or instructions from the user numerous times without fulfilling the task. This ensures that the user's original instructions were not achieved."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The expected API call is:  
`'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }'`.  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
`'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{""date"":""2025-02-30""}'`.  

The tool name is correct. However, the argument `""date""` does not match the required date of `""2024-02-18""`. Furthermore, the specified date by the model `""2025-02-30""` does not exist, which is another error in its reasoning.

Additionally, no final answer (`give_answer`) from the tooling was provided since the model ultimately attempted to invoke ""Finish"" and chose to restart instead of accomplishing the required task. Therefore, the user's instruction was not fulfilled. Given the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 directly fails as well."

For Objective 2, the expected tool call was `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'`. However, the model did not invoke this specific tool call. Instead, the closest relevant tools invoked include iterations using `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments such as `'{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}'` and `'{""date"": ""2025-02-28""}'`. These dates deviate from the required `2024-02-18`. Hence, the model failed to execute the correct tool call.  

Since Objective 2 failed, it implies that the model could not fulfill the user's instruction based on the retrieved API data or give a correct and relevant final answer. As a result, Objective 3 is also a failure."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",1161,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Required API call:  
`historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`.  

Actual API call made by the model:  
`historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}`.  

The model attempted to call the required tool, but the argument `date` is invalid (refers to a non-existent date) and does not match the expected argument `2024-02-18`. This constitutes a failure for Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Due to the invalid tool call that failed to fetch the required data, and the lack of valid final answer fulfilling the user's instruction based on the API call, Objective 3 fails. No meaningful final answer addressing the user's query was provided, as seen from the supplied evidence."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472?

2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with `{ ""ids"": ""80057281"" }`.  

The model only invoked:  
1. `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with `{ ""is_id"": ""90068472"" }`.

The first tool call (`title_trailers_for_netflix_data`) failed as the `is_id` argument was incorrect (expected `""80057281""` but provided `""90068472""`). The second required tool call (`title_details_for_netflix_data`) was not invoked at all. This discrepancy makes it a failure for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
The model chose not to provide a final answer and explicitly opted to ""give up and restart."" This fails to meet the user's objective. Furthermore, since Objective 2 was a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure."

2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""80057281""}'`.  

The model invoked the following tools:

The argument `""is_id"": ""90068472""` invoked by the model does not align with the expected argument `""is_id"": ""80057281""`. Additionally, the required API call for `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` was not invoked.  

For these reasons, the required API calls were not fulfilled accurately, resulting in a **failure for Objective 2.**

For Objective 3:
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. The model did not provide any valid final answer based on the user's instructions, nor does the process imply correct usage of the API for fulfilling the task requirement.  

Thus, both objectives result in failure."

The required API calls should involve the tools `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` and `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with an argument `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}` for each. Since the invoked tool did not reflect the required arguments (`getecz.com` vs. `ourbusinessplatform123124.net`), it qualifies as a discrepancy and failure of Objective 2. Additionally, the second required tool `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` was not invoked.   
Under Objective 3, because Objective 2 failed and the model did not provide a final answer fulfilling the user's request, Objective 3 also failed. This implies the final user instruction was not effectively achieved or pursued based on the retrieved API data."

26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- For Objective 2:  
  - The expected API call is `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`.  
  - The actual tool call made by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  
  - The expected API call was not invoked, and instead, an unrelated tool call (`'Finish'`) was made. Hence, this is a failure for Objective 2.  

- For Objective 3:  
  - Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model did not use any relevant API data to provide the user-required differentiation of the expression. Furthermore, the absence of a `'final_answer'` indicates failure to fulfill the user's request."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,1161,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`
2. `get_story_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`.

The actual tool calls made by the model are:
1. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""username"": ""leomesssi""}` (note: the username argument is misspelled as `leomesssi`).
2. The invocation of `get_story_for_instagram_profile` is missing.

The first tool call for `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` fails because the argument ""username"" does not match due to the spelling mistake (""leomessi"" ??""leomesssi""). Additionally, the model completely omitted calling the required `get_story_for_instagram_profile` tool. Therefore, Objective 2 is deemed a failure.  

**Objective 3:** Failure  
**Reason:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 directly fails because irrelevant or inaccurate tool calls cannot achieve the user's request. Additionally, no valid final answer was provided, as the output comprises repetitive template responses such as ""Hello! How can I assist you?"" This indicates that the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",1065,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
- The expected API call is:  
  `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with arguments `'{ ""term"": ""onomatopoeia"" }'`.  
- The actual API call made by the model is:  
  `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with arguments `'{ ""term"": ""onomatopoeiaa"" }'`.  

Although the tool name matches, the argument `""term"": ""onomatopoeiaa""` exhibits a spelling error when compared to the expected argument `""term"": ""onomatopoeia""`. This discrepancy violates rule #3 concerning spelling correctness, so this causes **Objective 2 to fail.**

Because Objective 2 failed, **Objective 3 also fails automatically** as the final response is reliant on the correct execution of the API calls. Additionally, the model failed to provide a satisfactory answer to retrieve the word's definition, pronunciation, and example usages based on retrieved and expected data. Instead, the model acknowledged its failure."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`{'name': 'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"",\n  ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""\n }'}`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
`{'id': 'call_b430f1ee64ae49d5bdcabfc7bba8c41b', 'function': {'arguments': '{""from_symbol"":""JPY"",""to_symbol"":""EUR""}', 'name': 'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'}, 'type': 'function'}`  

The model successfully invoked the required tool `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with the correct arguments (`""from_symbol"": ""JPY""` and `""to_symbol"": ""EUR""`) matching entirely. Thus, Objective 2 is successful.  

For Objective 3, the final answer from the model is:  
`{""final_answer"":""Based on the current exchange rate of 0.0062 JPY to EUR, 1000 JPY is equal to 6.2 EUR."",""return_type"":""give_answer""}`  

It correctly converts 1000 JPY to EUR based on the exchange rate and fulfills the user's requirement by providing accurate information. The final answer was explicitly provided and aligned with achievable results derived from the API call. Hence, Objective 3 is also successful."
30,"I need a list of trending pages on 9GAG along with their posts. Also, fetch the comments for a specific post and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'.",1065,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
- `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""kleido007"" }`

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `get_pages_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{}`  
2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  
3. `get_posts_from_category_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""category"":""trending""}`  

The required tool call, `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`, was never invoked. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure and the expected API was not invoked, the required data to fulfill the user's instruction was never retrieved. Additionally, no final answer was provided that uses the required tool call data. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",1161,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
1. For Objective 2, the expected API call was `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`. However, the tool invoked by the model was `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `{""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt""}`. While the tool name matches, the argument `""username""` does not match the expected one, so the invocation does not meet the expected criteria, leading to failure for Objective 2.  
2. For Objective 3, given that Objective 2 failed to meet the expected API calls, the model did not achieve the user's instruction to gather the required user profile. Furthermore, there was no final answer based on data retrieved from API results. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure."
32,"I'm a music lover and want to discover TikTok videos featuring a specific song. Can you fetch the music information for the song with the ID '8394725634879021564'? Additionally, retrieve the videos that feature this song.",1250,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:
1. **Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
   - **Expected Tool Calls**:
     1. `'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `{""url"": ""7002634556977908485""}`.  
     2. `'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `{""music_id"": ""7002634556977908485"", ""count"": ""20"", ""cursor"": ""0""}`.  
   - **Actual Tool Calls**:
     1. `'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `{""url"": ""8394725634879021564""}`.  

     The other required tool (`'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video'`) was **not called by the model**.  
     Additionally, the `'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video'` function was called with incorrect arguments (`""url"": ""8394725634879021564""` instead of `""url"": ""7002634556977908485""`).   
     Due to the mismatch in the required argument values and the incomplete invocation of all required API calls, **Objective 2 fails**.

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
   Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can straightforwardly infer that the model is unable to produce a valid or complete response based on the APIs. **Additionally, the final answer was not presented** as per user instruction. Therefore, **Objective 3 fails** as well."
33,"I need to analyze the engagement of a TikTok user's followers. Can you retrieve the follower list for a user with the ID '64556346745'? Also, fetch the user information for these followers.",1161,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call was `'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments:   
```json
{
  ""user_id"": ""107955"",
  ""count"": ""50"",

However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""count"": ""200"",
  ""user_id"": ""64556346745""
}
```  
The tool name used by the model, `'user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video'`, does not match the expected tool name, `'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video'`. Additionally, the argument values do not match the required set (e.g., `""user_id"": ""107955""` differs from `""user_id"": ""64556346745"", `""count"": ""50""` differs from `""count"": ""200""`, and the `""time""` parameter is missing in the actual call).

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed (the proper API call was not executed), the data required to fulfill the user's instruction was not retrieved. Additionally, the model ended the process by choosing to give up and restart (`""response"": ""chose to give up and restart""`) and did not provide a final or valid answer to the user's instruction."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",1065,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- Expected API calls:
  1. 'get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api' with arguments: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`
  2. 'get_stream_views_for_twitch_api' with arguments: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`
  3. 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with arguments: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`

- Actual tool calls by the model: 
  1. 'get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api' with arguments: `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`
  2. Model also called unnecessary and unrelated tools, such as 'Finish' and made repeated attempts, but they are irrelevant to the evaluation.
  
- The model did NOT attempt the other two required API calls ('get_stream_views_for_twitch_api' and 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'). Moreover, the argument used in the first call ('dfasagergs') does not match the required argument ('xqc'), failing in parameter correctness.

Because the model did not execute all the expected calls and the provided arguments are incorrect or not aligned semantically, it results in **failure** for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:
- The model did not provide a valid final answer. It indicated that it ""gave up and restarted"" due to insufficient data after processing incomplete and incorrect tool responses. Since the user's instruction relied on collecting Twitch streamer details based on API data, the model both failed to make the required API calls and failed to provide an answer fulfilling the user?™s instruction, resulting in **failure** for Objective 3."
35,Find the streamer 'shadoune66666' streamer's info.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool:
- `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"":""shadoune66666""}'`.

The required API call was:
- `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments:
  ```json
  {
    ""channel"": ""shadoune666""
  }
  ```

The tool name matches the required API, but the argument `channel` does not match. The model used `""shadoune66666""`, while the required value is `""shadoune666""`. This discrepancy in the argument makes Objective 2 a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can directly be inferred as a failure. The model's final answer is irrelevant when Objective 2 fails. Hence, both objectives fail."
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"- **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model:**

- **Required Tool Call:**  
  - `'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls'` with arguments `'{\n  ""upc"": ""194574942221""\n }'`  

The model used the correct tool, `products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls`. However, the `upc` value in the arguments does not match the required value. The model used `""upc"":""286193748563""` instead of the required `""upc"":""194574942221""`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  
   
### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer Objective 3 is a failure as well. The model did not accurately fulfill the required instruction. Moreover, the model chose to ""give up and restart,"" which means it failed to fulfill the user's request based on the required data API call and did not provide the final answer for the task."
37,"I'm redecorating my home and looking for furniture options. Can you list the available furniture products on Kohls? Also, provide me with the product reviews for a specific product with webID 5372023.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `'reviews_list_for_kohls'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""4201989""}`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'auto_complete_deprecating_for_kohls'` with arguments `{""query"": ""furniture""}`. The required API was not invoked, and the expected arguments were not used, leading to a failure for Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails by inference. Furthermore, the final provided answer was unrelated to the required API data, as no valid tool calls were made to retrieve necessary information for reviews of the specified product."
38,"I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this product, including images, pricing, and customer reviews?",1065,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API calls were:
  1. `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'`, and  
  2. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'`.  

  However, for the tool calls invoked by the model, there was:
  - A single invocation of the tool `'products_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""categoryid"":214970}'`.  

  This tool name does not match either of the expected `products_detail_for_wayfair` or `reviews_list_for_wayfair`, and the arguments aren't aligned either (e.g., there is no `""sku""` parameter). Additionally, `'reviews_list_for_wayair'` was not invoked. Thus, the model fails to meet Objective 2.  

- For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is already a failure, we can directly deduce that Objective 3 also fails. The model failed to use any relevant API calls to gather or present information for the user's request, and no final answer was generated to fulfill the user's request to retrieve and combine product details and reviews."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,1161,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation**:  

1. The required API calls were:  
   - `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'`  
   - `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'`  

2. In contrast, the invoked tool calls by the model were:  
   - `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"":""X005789621""}'`  

3. The first required tool `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` with specific arguments (`""sku"":""W003247135""`) was not invoked by the model.  
4. While the second required tool `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` was invoked, its arguments (`""sku"":""X005789621""`) did not match the required arguments `""sku"":""W003247135""`. The provided SKU is different, and such deviations in critical parameters like product SKUs cannot be considered semantically equivalent.  

Therefore, not all the required tools were invoked correctly which leads to a failure in Objective 2.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation**:   
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Moreover, the model did not generate a valid response (final answer) to fulfill the user's instruction; instead, it eventually terminated without accomplishing the intended purpose (i.e., retrieving product details and corresponding reviews)."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:

  The actual tool calls by the model include:  
  1. **`get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`** with arguments `'{ ""productid"": ""3OM3PS"" }'`  
     - Here, the argument does not match the required argument `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`, as the value ??OM3PS??is incorrect compared to ""B00K3OM3PS"".  
  2. **`Finish`** with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`  
     - This tool call does not match any of the required tools. It is an unnecessary tool.  
  3. **`get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`** with `'{ ""productid"": ""3OM3PS"" }'`  
     - This is incorrectly invoked, as it is neither one of the required tools, nor does the argument `""productid"": ""3OM3PS""` match the expected arguments for the required tools.  
  4. **Additional calls to `Finish`** with no impact on correctness.  

  Based on the mismatches highlighted above, certain required tools were never called (`get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`), while arguments are incorrect for those that were invoked. Hence, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 already failed, Objective 3 is automatically inferred as a **failure**. Additionally, the final answer was not provided by the model as it chose to ""give up and restart"". Hence, the user?™s instruction was not achieved."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",906,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
1. **Objective 2** - The actual tool calls made by the model only include repeated invocations of the `get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` tool with arguments containing `""searchquery"":""Mac""`. However, the required API calls include the following:  
   - `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`
   - `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`
   - `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{ ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS"" }`  

   The required tools are distinctly specific to product details, reviews, and offers retrieval, but none of these were invoked by the model. This inconsistency directly causes a failure for Objective 2.

2. **Objective 3** - Since Objective 2 failed (i.e., the required API calls were not executed), the model did not retrieve the proper data needed to fulfill the user's instruction regarding detailed data for the given product ID (`B00K3OM3PS`). Moreover, the output provided by the model does not contain any valid final answer based on retrieved API data, and in fact, the user request was left incomplete. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- For **Objective 2**, the expected API call is:  
  `{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{\n  ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""\n }'}`  

  The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
  `{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""}'}`  

  The model invoked the correct tool (`select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`), but the argument `""is_id""` does not match the expected value. The expected ID argument is `""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`, whereas the model used `""d27e0de553b9d7""`. Since the incorrect value of a required argument renders the tool call invalid, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- For **Objective 3**, as per the rule stated, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Furthermore, from the conversation, it is clear that the assistant ultimately gave up and restarted the session, meaning that the user's request to fulfill the operation was not achieved. The failure in invoking the correct API call and the absence of a valid final answer justify the failure for Objective 3."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API call: `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}'`.  
- The actual tool call made: `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""}'`.  
Here, there is a mismatch in the `is_id` value; the expected value (`6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7`) does not match the provided value (`d27e0de553b9d7`). Therefore, the model failed to execute the required API call properly.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, it directly results in a failure for Objective 3 as well. Additionally, the model's final response indicates it chose to give up and restart `""give_up_and_restart""`, which also fails to meet the user's task requirement."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:    

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is as follows:  
- Tool: `symbol_for_stock_data`  
- Arguments: `{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`  

The actual tool call invoked by the model is as follows:  
- Tool: `symbol_for_stock_data`  
- Arguments: `{""symbol"": ""QQQQ""}`  

While the tool name is correct, the argument ""Symbol"" does not match. Specifically, the expected value is ""TQQQ"", but the actual value is ""QQQQ"", which is incorrect. This mismatch means Objective 2 is not successfully achieved.  

For Objective 3:  
As Objective 2 failed, it cannot use the correct API data, making it impossible for the final answer to achieve the user's instruction. Additionally, no valid final answer was provided. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API call is `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments `'{""name"": ""riven""}'`. The expected champion name is `""riven""`.  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model is `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stat'` with arguments `'{""name"":""raven""}'`. The tool name slightly differs (`stat` vs. `stats`), but the primary failure lies in the argument where the champion name `""raven""` is spelled incorrectly?”it fails to correspond to the required `""riven""`.  
- Due to this discrepancy, Objective 2 fails because the tool name is not an exact match and the arguments are incorrect semantically.  
- Since the Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure. No valid final answer was generated to respond to the user's query, and the attempt clearly did not fulfill the task requirement. Additionally, the model did not use the API results effectively to achieve the instruction but opted to restart everything instead."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,1161,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call is `{'name': 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""\n }'}`.  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model is `{'name': 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', 'arguments': '{""asin"":""B07ZPKBL9V1""}'}`.  
- Although the tool name is correct (`product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data`), the argument `asin` is incorrect. Specifically, the expected `asin` is `""B07ZPKBL9V""`, but the actual provided `asin` is `""B07ZPKBL9V1""`. Since there is a mismatch in the argument, ***Objective 2 does not meet success criteria***. This renders **Objective 2 a failure**.  
- Referring to guideline #13, if **Objective 2** is a failure, then **Objective 3** automatically fails. Therefore, **Objective 3 fails as well** regardless of the model?™s final response or reasoning."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool invoked by the model was `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with arguments `'{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fri""}'`. However, the required API call was `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with arguments `'{\n  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",\n  ""toLang"": ""fr""\n }'`. The model used ""tolang"": ""fri"" instead of ""toLang"": ""fr"". This is an incorrect argument, considering ""fri"" seems unrelated to the required ""fr"" for French translation and fails to match exact semantic parity. As Objective 2 was a failure, Objective 3 can also be directly considered a failure. Furthermore, the final answer did not fulfill the user's instruction as it claimed the translation did not occur while providing what appears to be non-validated output suggestive of Friulian. Overall, the instruction was not achieved."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call is `get_info_day_for_working_days` with arguments `{ ""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31"" }`. However, the actual API call invoked by the model is `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` with arguments `{ ""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""9999-99-99"" }`. Although the first part of the name (`get_info_day_for_working_days` vs. `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days`) may be related, the arguments differ significantly. Specifically, the date argument is in an invalid format (""9999-99-99""), rather than the required ""2022-12-31"". This discrepancy marks the model's call as incorrect according to Objective 2, leading to failure.  

For Objective 3: As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the model's response reports errors and chooses to give up, and it does not provide a final answer to the task. Therefore, the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"```json
{
  ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",
  ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
  ""country_code"": ""US""
}
```
However, there are no actual tool calls invoked by the model in the provided data (`tool_calls` is `None` in all entries). As a result, the model failed to invoke the required function.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Reason: Since there were no tool calls invoked (Objective 2 is a failure) and the model did not provide any final answer (`give_answer` and `final_answer` are absent), Objective 3 also fails as the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
```
{'name': 'add_working_hours_for_working_days', 'arguments': '{ ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""start_time"": ""08:15"", ""increment_time"": 2004 }'}
```

The model made the following tool calls:  
1. `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments:  
   ```
   '{ ""country_code"": ""US"", ""increment_time"": ""2004:00"", ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""start_time"": ""25:15"" }'
