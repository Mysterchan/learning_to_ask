1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",4,Failure,Success,Failure,"**Reason**:  
- For Objective 2, the expected tool call was:  
   `'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date1"": ""2023-12-01"",\n  ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""\n  }'`.  
   The actual tool call made by the model was:  
   `'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}'`.  
   The tool name matches correctly, and the arguments provided (i.e., `date1 = 12-01-2023` and `date2 = 12-31-2023`) are functionally identical to (and semantically equivalent to) the expected arguments `date1 = 2023-12-01` and `date2 = 2023-12-31`. As per the rules, this equivalence qualifies as a success.  

- For Objective 3, the assistant made repeated tool calls and obtained responses indicating lottery drawing details (e.g., `DrawingDate`, `Time`, `NumberSet`, etc.). However, there was no ""give_answer"" response indicating the fulfillment of the instructions or the presentation of a final meaningful answer to the user. Therefore, the final required answer to the user's task was not provided, marking this as a failure for Objective 3."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call specifies the tool `hot_100_for_billboard` with the argument `{""date"": ""2022-07-20""}`. However, all actual tool calls by the model use the tool `hot_100_for_billboard` but with the argument `{""date"": ""2024-02-24""}`. The `date` argument does not match, so this constitutes a failure for Objective 2.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The incorrect date argument means that the model failed to satisfy the user's requirement based on the needed API call, and any final response would be invalid."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- Tool name: `billboard_200_for_billboard` with arguments: `{""date"":""2020-03-18""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. Tool name: `billboard_global_200_for_billboard` with arguments: `{""date"":""2020-03-18""}`  
2. Tool name: `Finish` with arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The required API call `billboard_200_for_billboard` is not invoked by the model. Instead, an incorrect tool call `billboard_global_200_for_billboard` was made. Consequently, Objective 2 fails.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model chose to ""give up and restart"" instead of providing an answer. Therefore, the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call is `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`, but the actual invoked tool call is `{'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""final_answer"":""Hello! How can I help you today?"", ""return_type"":""give_answer""}'}`. These do not match, as the required API call is not invoked. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  
As for Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. The model's final response did not utilize the necessary APIs to fulfill the user's request, which was to fetch motivational quotes to start the day. Instead, the answer given was unrelated to the user's query."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2, the required API call is `'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with arguments `'{""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us""}'`.  
   However, the tool invoked by the model is `'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with arguments `'{""countrycode"":""US"",""keyword"":""research study""}'`.  
   The argument ""countryCode"" is correct by meaning (""US"" and ""us"" can be considered the same upon case-insensitive comparison), but the ""keyword"" argument shows a mismatch between ""technology"" (required) and ""research study"" (actual). As the mismatch leads to a failure, Objective 2 is considered a failure.  

2. As per Objective 3, if Objective 2 fails, it can directly infer the failure of Objective 3."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The tool invoked by the model is:  
- `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"":""nodejs developer"",""location"":""New York""}`  

The required API call is:  
- `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{\n  ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",\n  ""location"": ""New York""\n }`  

The tool name matches exactly, and the arguments are semantically the same and correctly provided. The added formatting in the required call does not influence the correctness of the match since both convey the same meaning fully. Therefore, Objective 2 is met successfully.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided is:  
""Based on data from Glassdoor, the estimated salary for a Nodejs Developer in New York City is between $111,291.66 and $184,766.85 per year, with a median of $142,309.34.""  

This answer directly fulfills the user's instruction and is coherent with the data derived from the appropriate API call. The model achieves the user's requirement of providing a salary estimate.  
Therefore, Objective 3 is also met successfully."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{ ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York"" }'`  

The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
`'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""job_title"":""Software Engineer"",""location"":""New York""}'`  

While the tool name is correct, the required argument `""job_title""` does not match. The argument was expected to be `""nodejs developer""`, but the actual invocation used `""Software Engineer""`, which indicates the tool call fails. Since there is a mismatch in the key prerequisite argument `job_title`, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that the user's instruction was not accurately fulfilled and therefore Objective 3 fails as well."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,6,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the expected API call is:  
`{'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""\n  }'}`
  
The tools invoked by the model are:  
1. `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with `{'arguments': '{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}'} `  
2. `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with `{'arguments': '{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}'} `

Both the required tool name `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` and its argument `""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""` match perfectly with the actual tool calls made by the model (there are duplicates, but that does not affect correctness). The match indicates this objective is successfully achieved.  

For Objective 3, the model generates a final answer based on the retrieved API data:  
```
Your TikTok profile information:
  
Username: the_beautyofcinema  
ID: 7073509889447855110  
Profile Picture: [URL link provided in response]  
```  
The final answer closely corresponds to the data fetched from the API response, fulfilling the original user request (retrieving the TikTok profile information). The model did not fabricate any content, and the provided answer directly depends on the API response.  
Thus, Objective 3 is successfully achieved."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
- The required API call is:
  ```  
  {'name': 'video_details_for_tiktok_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""\n  }'}
  ```  
- The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
  ```  
  [{'name': 'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api', 'arguments': '{""username"":""7097255034731138310""}'}]  
  ```  
- The tool name differs ('user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api' was invoked instead of 'video_details_for_tiktok_api'), and the required argument ('video_id') is not used. Instead, the model incorrectly uses 'username' with the value ""7097255034731138310"". Hence, the tool call does not match the required API call, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

- Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can also be directly determined as a failure. Additionally, no valid or completed answer was provided by the model relevant to the user's request. Instead, the model made multiple unsuccessful attempts due to the erroneous API call and never achieved the user's goal or gave a final answer. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2:**  
   - **Actual tool calls made by the model:**  
     1. Tool name: `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`, Arguments: `{""ids"":""2244994945,1618961126,886403513572044800""}`
     2. Tool name: `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`, Arguments: `{""ids"":""2244994945""}`
     3. Tool name: `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`, Arguments: `{""ids"":""2244994945""}`
     4. Tool name: `Finish`, Arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`    

   - **Expected tool calls:**  
     1. Tool name: `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`, Arguments: `{""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""}`

   - Upon comparison:
     - The tool name `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` is correctly used by the model in the first three instances.
     - However, the model's `arguments` do not match the required `arguments`. Instead of querying for `ids` values `44196397` and `155659213`, the model queries for `ids` values `2244994945`, `1618961126`, and `886403513572044800` (different non-matching IDs).
     - Furthermore, the tool `""Finish""` was invoked, but it was not required, although this would not impact the overall evaluation. What's critical is that the required tool call (with the correct `arguments`) was **not performed**.
     - Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure**.

2. **Objective 3:**  
   - Because Objective 2 failed, the required data was not retrieved, and the model did not provide a valid final response related to the user's instruction. In fact, the data retrieval tools either collected irrelevant IDs or chose to ""give up and restart,"" which indicates the information retrieval process was unsuccessful.  
   - There is no valid final answer (""give_answer"" is not present), meaning Objective 3 fails."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call was `{'name': 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""yousuck2020""\n  }'}`, but the tool call invoked by the model was `{'name': 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{""username"":""elonmusk""}'}`. The argument specified (`""username"": ""elonmusk""`) does not match the required argument (`""username"": ""yousuck2020""`). Additionally, the model invoked a secondary and unrelated API call, `{'name': 'user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{""is_id"":""44196397""}'}`, which was not required. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, it means the required data was not retrieved correctly through the specified tools. The final answer provided by the model (about Elon Musk's Twitter ID and bio) was based on incorrect API execution and does not satisfy the actual requirement. Therefore, Objective 3 also fails."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",10,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the following tools were invoked by the model:  
1. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""num"": 1, ""q"": ""weather forecast for [destination] next 7 days""}`  

The required tool calls were:  
1. `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"": ""Hawaii""}`  
2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""}`  

There are mismatches with both of the required calls:  
- The model attempted to invoke `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` incorrectly as its `q` argument (`""weather forecast for [destination] next 7 days""`) neither specifies the required location nor aligns precisely with the semantic requirement of `""weather forecast in Hawaii""`. Thus, it fails this requirement.  
- The second required tool, `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `{""q"": ""Hawaii""}`, was not invoked at all.  

Due to these discrepancies, Objective 2 is a failure. According to the rule stipulated, failure in Objective 2 directly leads to failure in Objective 3. Thus, without proper and complete API responses, Objective 3 (generating the final answer) also fails."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `'{""location_parameters_auto"":""true"",""q"":""popular attractions and restaurants in [CITY_NAME]""}'`.  
2. `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `'{""q"":""Popular attractions and restaurants in London, Ontario""}'`.  

However, the only **required API call** is:  
1. `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `'{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}'`.  

The expected API call's argument intends to search for popular attractions in Paris. None of the arguments provided in the actual tool calls match the expected intent or specific query; ""[CITY_NAME]"" and ""London, Ontario"" do not refer to Paris. Because the correct tool call was not made, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The user requested information regarding popular attractions in Paris, but the final response does not address Paris. Instead, the response lists attractions and restaurants in London, Ontario, showing a clear mismatch between the user's instruction and the model's final answer."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
Expected API call was `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. The required tool was not invoked at all, so Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, the final objective cannot succeed. The model chose to ""give up and restart"" abruptly and did not attempt to provide an answer to the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,10,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**: 
- The required API call: `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB"" }`.
- The actual tool call made by the model: `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""NY323068998GB"" }`.

The tool name and the semantic intent of the argument match, even though the argument name has a slight casing discrepancy (""trackingNumber"" vs. ""trackingnumber""). However, as we are instructed to be flexible with such minor naming differences if the intent matches exactly (and it does in this context), this is deemed a success.  

For **Objective 3**:  
While the model correctly invoked the required tool to detect the carrier from the tracking number, it did not provide a final answer that fully fulfilled the user?™s instruction. The response, ""The tracking number NY323068998GB could be from either Royal Mail or UBI Logistics. More information is needed to determine the correct carrier,"" means that the model was unable to confidently provide the carrier details as required. Furthermore, there was no follow-up or additional steps taken to conclusively derive the carrier information using the provided resources/tools.

Hence:  
- Objective 2: Success (the correct API call was executed with appropriate arguments).  
- Objective 3: Failure (the user request to determine the carrier was not fulfilled completely, and the final response did not meet the instruction)."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""username"": ""jackie""}`. The actual tool call made by the model is `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""corsenabled"": null, ""nextmaxid"": null, ""username"": ""[username]""}`. The model passed an incorrect value `[username]` instead of the expected value `""jackie""` for the argument `""username""`, resulting in a mismatch. Therefore, it failed Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as per the evaluation guidelines. Additionally, the final answer by the model is missing, which further underscores the failure in fulfilling the user's instruction."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The expected tool call is:  
1. **`rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2`** with arguments '{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}'.  

However, the actual tool call made by the model was:  
1. **`rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2`** with arguments '{""address"":""123 Main St, Anytown, CA""}'.  

The address parameters do not match (""123 Main St, Anytown, CA"" is different from ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""), which makes this tool call incorrect. Therefore, Objective 2 failed.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 has failed, the outcome for Objective 3 is directly considered a failure. Additionally, the model's process ends with the tool call to `Finish` and does not provide a final answer fulfilling the user's instruction. Instead, it indicates choosing to ""give up and restart,??which is inadequate in achieving the user's requirement."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
- Actual Tool Calls made by the model:  
  1. `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` with arguments `{""location"":""New York, NY"",""search_within_x_miles"":50}`  

- Required API Call:  
  1. `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` with arguments `{ ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"" }`  

- The tool name matches, but the ""location"" argument does not:  
  - The actual tool call specifies `""location"": ""New York, NY""`, while the required call specifies `""location"": ""12750""`. The two locations have entirely different identifiers, thus failing the correct input requirement.  
  - While the additional parameter is valid (Rule 1), the mismatch in key argument values leads to Objective 2 failure.

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails, as the final answer could not have effectively fulfilled the user?™s instruction. The mismatch in tool call and incorrect location parameters misaligns with the requirement outcomes."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2 Analysis**:  
  - Tools invoked by the model:  
    1. `'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data'` with `{ ""city"": ""San Jose"", ""offset"": ""0"", ""state_code"": ""CA"" }`  

  - Required API call:  
    1. `'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data'` with `{
  ""city"": ""San Jose"",
  ""state_code"": ""CA"",
  ""offset"": ""0""
}`  

  - Comparison: The actual tool call by the model matches the required API call in terms of tool name and arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

- **Objective 3 Analysis**:  
  - The final response provided by the model is:  
  `Based on the provided data, here is the property information:\n\nAddress: 1206 Becket Dr, San Jose, CA 95121\nListing Price: $1,288,000\nListing ID: 2977109762\nLast Update Date: 2025-01-21T12:40:11Z\nOpen House: No Open House Available`  

  - The provided information aligns with the type of data a real estate API would retrieve. There are no signs that the response is made up, as the system has clearly utilized data from the API to construct the response. No deviations or unsupported statements are present.  

  Based on this, Objective 3 is a success."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- Required tool call: `time_zone_for_geodb_cities` with arguments `{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}`.  
- Actual tool calls by the model:
  1. `admin_divisions_near_location_for_geodb_cities` with arguments `{""countryids"":""US,CA,MX"",""distanceunit"":""KM"",""locationid"":""37.09024,-95.712892"",""radius"":""5000"",""timezoneids"":""America/New_York,America/Los_Angeles,America/Chicago,America/Denver""}`; and
  2. `Finish` for an unrelated attempt, indicating a ""give up and restart.""  

The actual tool names invoked are completely different from the required tool (`time_zone_for_geodb_cities`). Consequently, the actual calls do not match the expected call as per the requirements, leading to the failure of Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is already a failure, Objective 3 directly fails. Additionally, the model themselves ""gave up and restarted,"" so no correct final answer was provided to fulfill the user's instruction."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**
- Expected API call:  
  `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments:  
  ```  
  {
    ""countryCode"": ""DE""
  }  
  ```  

- Actual tool invoked by the model:  
  `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments:  
  ```  
  {
    ""countrycode"": ""DE""
  }  
  ```  

The tool name matches exactly as required. Although the argument key ""countryCode"" appears as ""countrycode"", the key name mismatch likely results because of technical constraints and fits within the evaluation clause that considers such deviations. The values (`""DE""`) match perfectly. Since the required tool is invoked with sufficient compatibility, Objective 2 is marked as a success.  

**Objective 3:**
The model used the response from the tool `country_details_for_referential_db` to form the final answer that fulfilled the requirement. The final answer is:  
```
Country: Germany
Capital: Berlin
Region: Europe
Currency: Euro

Note:  State-level latitude and longitude information is not available through the provided tools.  
```
This response satisfies the user's request as it provides accurate country details (name, capital, region, currency) based on the API call. Additionally, the model explicitly mentions the lack of state-level latitude and longitude details, which are not retrievable via the provided tools?”the response adheres to the data obtained and addresses the limitations effectively. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls were:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }`  
2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }`.

However, the model made a single actual tool call:  
- `'Finish'` with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`.  

This does not match any of the required tool calls, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly a failure as well. Furthermore, the model chose to give up and restart, which means no final answer was generated, and the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected API calls are:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}`  
2. The tool `'states_for_referential_db'` was not invoked by the model.  

The tool `'country_details_for_referential_db'` had a mismatch in the argument key when compared to the required argument (""countrycode"" vs. ""countryCode"", which differs in capitalization). This constitutes a failure as the argument key was not exact. Additionally, the model completely omitted the required `'states_for_referential_db'` tool call, leading to failure for this objective.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, in the final answer, it is clear that the model acknowledges a limitation stating it does not have access to ""state-level data (latitude and longitude)"" for Japan within the API. This limitation directly results from the failure to invoke the required `'states_for_referential_db'` tool, rendering the user's instruction incomplete. Therefore, Objective 3 also fails."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,12,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, no tool calls were invoked by the model in the provided conversation, which means none were evaluated for closure to the required API call (`get_photos_for_realtor_search` with arguments: `{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}`). This directly leads to Objective 3 being a failure because no API-driven data processing occurred, and the model gave no final answer. Consequently, it failed to achieve the user's instruction."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The actual tool call made by the model was: `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `'{""limit"":5,""query"":""intimate restaurants"",""region"":""US""}'`.  
- The expected tool call was: `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}'`.  
- The arguments do not match; in particular, the `query` parameter is entirely different (`""intimate restaurants"", ""region"": ""US""` vs `""restaurants, NY, USA""`), and additional arguments like `limit` and `region` also appear in the actual tool call. This represents a failure for Objective 2, as the required API call was not invoked correctly.  
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the required API data was not correctly used to achieve the user's task. Additionally, no valid final answer (`'give_answer'`) was provided to fulfill the user's instruction, further emphasizing the failure."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",10,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the expected API calls are:  
1. `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`  
2. `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with arguments `{""petId"": ""1""}`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
1. `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments `{""username"": ""user1"", ""password"": ""password""}`  

Analysis:  
- The first tool call (`loginuser_for_pet_store`) has mismatched arguments. The expected `username` is ""johnsmith"", but the model used ""user1"". Similarly, the expected `password` is ""password123"", but the model used ""password"". Hence, this tool call fails to meet the requirements.  
- The second required tool call (`getpetbyid_for_pet_store`) was never invoked by the model.  

As a result, the actual tool calls do not match the expected API calls.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that objective 2 is also a failure. The final answer also does not appear to exist in the given data, and even if it did, no valid data was retrieved from the required API calls to ensure the user's instruction could be fulfilled. Thus, the user's request is not achieved, leading to failure."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**: The expected API call is `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""id"":""81040344""}'`. The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""Squid Game""}'`.  
  2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}'`.

  The tool name (`'title_details_for_netflix_data'` instead of `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'`) and the argument (`'{""ids"": ""Squid Game""}'` instead of `'{""id"": ""81040344""}'`) are incorrect. Since the required tool call was not invoked, Objective 2 fails.

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure. Additionally, the model does not provide a final answer and instead ""chose to give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's requirement."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `'{""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003""}'`. The actual API call made by the model was `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""nm1508003"", ""tconst"": ""tt10946880""}'`. The argument `is_id` deviates from the expected `id`, and `tconst` has a completely different value (`tt10946880` instead of `tt10919420`). This discrepancy in arguments makes it a failure for Objective 2.  

Because Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure by default. Furthermore, even if we consider the given answer, it is directly linked to the incorrect API results obtained earlier, and thus it does not fulfill the accurate achievement of the user's instruction."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API call was `{'name': 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{\n  ""month"": ""7"",\n  ""day"": ""27""\n  }'}`.  
- The model invoked the tool `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` three times, specifically with the arguments `{""day"":1,""month"":7}`, which is different from the required arguments as the model provided the day ""1"" rather than the expected day ""27"".  
- Since the arguments do not match, Objective 2 fails.  
- As per the rules, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, there is no final answer provided in the responses for this case. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the tool call by the model is:  
- Tool: `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database`  
  Arguments: `{""nconst"":""nm0000417"",""tconst"":""tt0092455""}`  

The required API call was:  
- Tool: `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database`  
  Arguments: `{\n  ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"",\n  ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""\n  }`  

The tool name matches, but the ""nconst"" argument does not match (`nm0000417` ??`nm1508003`). Consequently, the tool call made by the model failed to fulfill the required API call, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, there is no valid final answer provided. Additionally, since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer a failure for Objective 3 as the required API call was not properly fulfilled."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
- `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  

Actual tool calls made by the model are:  
- `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"":""AAPL""}`
- `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"":""AAPL""}`
- `'Finish'` with arguments `{""final_answer"":""The company...'}`  

The model did not invoke the required API call (`stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `""symbol"": ""TSLA""`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, the final answer provided by the model pertains to `AAPL` stock earnings data, which does not fulfill the user's required instruction related to `TSLA`."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`{'name': 'exchange_for_currency_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""base"": ""USD"",\n ""to"": ""EUR""\n  }'}`  

The model invoked the following tool:  
`{'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'}`  

The tool call by the model does not align with the required API call, as the tool name (`Finish`) and arguments are completely different from the required tool (`exchange_for_currency_v2`). This results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, it means the necessary data to fulfil the user's instruction was not retrieved. Additionally, the model indicated ""give up and restart"" rather than providing a final answer. Hence, Objective 3 also fails."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool call is:  
`{'name': 'symbol_for_stock_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""Symbol"": ""TSLA""\n }'}`  

The actual tool invoked by the model is:  
`{'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', 'name': 'Finish'}}`.  

The tool name (`Finish`) and the argument provided by the model do not correspond to the required API call to `symbol_for_stock_data`. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, the model failed to make the required tool calls needed to achieve the user's instruction. Per the evaluation rules, Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, the model chose to ""give up and restart"" and did not give the final answer based on the required tools to fulfill the user's instruction."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- Tool name: ""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data""  
- Arguments: `{ ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"" }`  

The model made multiple actual API calls, for example:  
1. Tool name: ""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data""  
   Arguments: `{""base"":""USD"",""market_venue"":""Binance"",""start"":""2023-01-01T00:00:00"",""symbol"":""BTC""}`  
2. Tool name: ""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data""  
   Arguments: `{""base"":""USD"",""end"":""2023-01-22T00:00:00"",""expiration"":""perpetual"",""gran"":""1d"",""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2023-01-19T00:00:00"",""symbol"":""BTC""}`  
3. ... and others.

The issues causing failure for Objective 2:  
1. None of the actual arguments fully matches the required arguments of `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT""}`.  
2. Some mismatches include the `""start""` date, which is entirely different, and `""base""`, where ""USD"" is used instead of ""USDT"". These differences show non-alignment with the expected tool call.  
Thus, **Objective 2** fails due to incorrect tool call arguments.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 fails, the model could not fetch the correctly requested data via API as per the user's instruction. Hence, even if the model did return a final response (though none explicitly indicated here), it would still fail to fulfill the user instruction in providing the relevant API data. Additionally, the model does not provide a ""final_answer"" in its output, which further ensures failure for Objective 3."

36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2, the model fails because it does not invoke the required tool call `recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with the arguments matching `{""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY""}`. Instead, three different tool calls occur which include:  
1. `'orical_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rate'` with arguments `{""date"":""2024-08-08"",""is_from"":""USD"",""to"":""JPY""}`.  
2. An entirely invalid or hallucinated API call: `'invalid_hallucination_function_name'` with arguments `{""date"":""2024-04-26"",""is_from"":""USD"",""to"":""JPY""}`.  
3. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` indicating the model abandoned the user instruction entirely. Multiple flaws here, the required tool is never called. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 is also a failure regardless of any subsequent analysis of the final answer, as the required API data could not have informed the conclusion. Moreover, the ""final answer"" implies the model attempted ""give up and restart"", which fails the user's instruction outright (no proper answer given)."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For objective 1, the required API call is:  
`{'name': 'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""country"": ""Philippines""\n }'}`  

The model invoked:  
`{'name': 'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_ap', 'arguments': '{""country"":""Egypt""}'}`  

There are discrepancies in both the tool name (""esites_by_a_country..."" does not match the required ""query_divesites_by_a_country..."") and the argument (the required country is ""Philippines,"" but the model provided ""Egypt""). Therefore, objective 1 fails.  

Since objective 1 is a failure, we can directly infer that objective 2 also fails. Further, the model does not provide a valid final answer; instead, it gave up and restarted, as shown in the `""Finish""` tool call. This confirms failure for objective 2."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",10,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2 Failure**:  
    The required tool call is:  
    ```
    {'name': 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""operation"": ""rent"",\n ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"", \n ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""\n }'}
    ```  
    However, the actual tool call made by the model is:  
    ```
    {'name': 'auto_complete_for_idealista_v2', 'arguments': '{""country"":""pt"",""prefix"":""Lisbon, Portugal""}'}
    ```  
    The model failed to invoke the required tool `properties_list_for_idealista_v2`. The actual tool (`auto_complete_for_idealista_v2`) is not part of the required tool calls for this request. Additionally, no subsequent tool call for `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with appropriate arguments was made. Consequently, the model's tool usage did not fulfill the API call requirement, and Objective 2 is a failure.

- **Objective 3 Failure**:  
    Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also considered a failure because the model did not successfully use the required API to retrieve and base its response on relevant information. Furthermore, no final answer was provided by the model in the dataset, which independently confirms the failure of Objective 3."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Evaluating Objective 2:  
- **Tools invoked by the model**:
    - `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments: `{""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",""operation"":""rent""}`
    - `Finish` with arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`
- **Required API calls**:
    - `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments: `{\n  ""operation"": ""rent"",\n ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"" , \n ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""\n }`

The invoked tool `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` is correct in terms of the tool name, but the arguments are missing the required field `""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara""`. This constitutes an incomplete API call and leads to a failure for Objective 2.

Evaluating Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly marked as a failure as well. Additionally, the model output indicates a choice to ""give up and restart,"" demonstrating it did not follow through to correctly generate a final answer derived from the API data to meet the user's instruction."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,10,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- The expected API call is:  
  'club_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments `{""id"": ""985""}`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments `{""domain"":""com"",""is_id"":""66""}`.  

The tool name itself is not correct (""clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket"" differs from the expected ""club_profile_for_transfermarket""), and the argument keys (""id"" vs. ""domain"" and ""is_id"") also do not match (despite similarities in intent, no semantic connection between ""66"" and ""985"" exists). This mismatch makes the actual call fail to meet the requirements of the expected call.  

For Objective 3:  
Because Objective 2 fails, the final answer is invalid, and thus Objective 3 is deemed a failure as well. No valid informational answer was provided to the user's instruction. Moreover, no ""final_answer"" or relevant explanation fulfilling the user's expected instruction regarding club profile retrieval is present."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,10,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool to be invoked is `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with the arguments `'{ ""id"": ""28003"" }'`. However, the actual tool invoked by the model is `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` but with arguments `'{ ""domain"": ""com"", ""is_id"": 316 }'`. The ""id"" argument does not match the required value of ""28003"". Consequently, Objective 2 is a failure. Because Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure based on the given rule."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:** The required API call is as follows:  
  `{'name': 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{ ""competitionids"": ""GB1"" , ""clubids"": ""985"" }'}`  

  The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `{'name': 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{""clubids"":""985""}'}`  

  The tool name is correct, but the required argument `competitionids` with value `""GB1""` is entirely absent in the actual tool call. While the argument `clubids` is correctly included, the lack of `competitionids` makes the tool call incomplete and inaccurate. This is a **failure** for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model invoked the `""Finish""` tool and does not proceed to provide a final answer to the user's request, formalizing the failure to fulfill the user's instruction."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The tool invoked by the model:  
  `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` with arguments `'{""domain"":""AR"",""hotel_id"":12345,""locale"":""es_ar""}'`  
- The required API calls:  
  `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` with arguments `'{""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"": ""es_ar"", ""hotel_id"": ""1105156""}'`  

The tool name matches correctly, but the argument `""hotel_id""` should be `""1105156""`, whereas the model provided `""12345""`. Therefore, the tool call is incorrect, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails. Moreover, the model did not provide a meaningful final answer fulfilling the user's requirement, as the ""final_answer"" section is absent and the model's decision was to ""give up and restart."""
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The tools invoked by the model are as follows:  
1. `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `'{""destination"":""Europe"",""passport"":""United States""}'`.  

The expected API calls are:  
1. `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `'{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}'`.  
2. `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `'{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}'`.  
3. `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with arguments `'{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES""}'`.  

The tool name matches, but the parameters differ significantly, especially with the argument `""destination""` where the model inputted `""Europe""` instead of detailed destinations such as `""FR""`, `""IT""`, or `""ES""`. The `""passport""` argument provided by the model is also `""United States""` instead of `""US""`. These differences indicate that the actual tool call does not align semantically or logically with any of the expected tool calls, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, the model chose to ""give up and restart,"" which eliminates the possibility of providing a final answer derived from the API data that fulfills the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 fails."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call was `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with the arguments: `'{""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000}'`. However, the actual tool call was `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with the arguments: `'{""amount"":""1000"",""is_from"":""USD"",""to"":""EUR""}'`. The argument `""from""` is expected to be `""JPY""`, but the model passed `""USD""` instead. This mismatch makes Objective 2 a failure.  
  
For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, it directly implies that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model's final provided answer does not fulfil the user's instruction as it is based on the wrong context (converted ""USD"" to ""EUR"" instead of the required ""JPY"" to ""EUR"")."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
1. The expected API call is:  
   Tool name: `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days`,  
   Arguments: `{""city"": ""London""}`  

2. The actual tools invoked by the model were:  
   - Tool name: `get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days`,  
     Arguments: `{""lat"":34,""lon"":134}`  
   - Tool name: `Finish`,  
     Arguments: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

   There is a mismatch between the tools invoked by the model and the required API call. Specifically:  
   - The required tool call `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` was never invoked by the model.  
   - None of the invoked tools align semantically or contextually with the expected one.  

Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover:  
- The ""final answer"" or response to fulfill the user's instruction using comprehensive API data is missing. The justification to ""give up and restart"" is evident from the model log, which prevents the user's instruction from being fulfilled."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the following tool:  
- Tool name: `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'`  
   Arguments: `{""base"":""USD"",""end_date"":""2024-03-08"",""start_date"":""2024-01-01"",""symbols"":""XAU""}`.  

The **expected API call**:  
- Tool name: `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'`  
   Arguments: `{
  ""base"": ""USD"",
 ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"",
 ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"",
 ""symbols"": ""XAU""
}`.  

The tool name matches, but the argument values are incorrect:  
- `start_date` was expected to be `""2022-12-20""`, but the actual value was `""2024-01-01""` (wrong date).  
- `end_date` was expected to be `""2023-01-10""`, but the actual value was `""2024-03-08""` (wrong date).  

Because of the mismatched arguments, Objective 2 fails.

For **Objective 3**, the model ultimately gave up on the task and invoked a 'Finish' tool with the intent `""give_up_and_restart""`. This means it could not complete the user's instruction based on API responses, nor did it provide a final answer. Since Objective 2 failed, we can also directly infer Objective 3 fails."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,10,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
- The expected tool call was:  
  `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments:  
  `""date"": ""2024-01-15""`  

- The actual tool call made by the model was:  
  `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments:  
  `""date"": ""2024-01-15""`  

The tool name and required argument align perfectly, making Objective 2 a success.  

For **Objective 3**:  
The model does not provide a final answer using the retrieved data. Instead, it indicates it could not retrieve scores and concludes by generating inappropriate follow-up messages (like various greetings). Therefore, it fails to achieve the user's instruction. This results in a failure for Objective 3."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,4,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",\n  ""variable"": ""x""\n }'}`  

The tool calls invoked by the model are repeated calls of:  
`'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",""variable"":""x""}'`  

The actual tool name matches the required API tool name, and the arguments are semantically equivalent. This makes Objective 2 a **Success**, even if the tool was invoked multiple times for the same task.

For Objective 3: The final answer from the model is absent (no `'return_type': 'give_answer'` appears in the responses). Since no final answer is provided to fulfill the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a **Failure**."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with arguments `{""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with arguments `{""sdate"": ""2023-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2024-01-01"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}`. The `sdate` and `edate` parameters do not match the required values, making the call incorrect. 

According to the rule, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, no valid final answer was present due to the mismatched tool arguments and the use of the 'Finish' function to indicate giving up. Thus, the user's instruction was not achieved."
