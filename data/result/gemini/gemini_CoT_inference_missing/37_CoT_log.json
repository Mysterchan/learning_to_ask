Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.world_scuba_diving_sites_api: Are you a scuba diver looking for interesting dive sites around the world? You can now easily search for them using a text query to the endpoint based on a location or region. With our list of GPS coordinates for scuba diving sites, you can quickly find the coordinates of the places you want to explore and add them to your diving itinerary. Simply enter the name of the location or region you are interested in, and our system will provide you with a list of relevant coordinates for you to use ...\n"
