1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

### Objective 2
The required API calls are:  
1. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`
2. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `'{""trackingnumber"":"".YT9999999999""}'`  
2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `'{""trackingnumber"":""YT2003521266065328""}'`  
3. `Finish` with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`

The following issues lead to failure in Objective 2:  
- The correct API call `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }` is present as the second call, but the name of the argument `trackingnumber` deters from the required name `trackingNumber`. This indicates a semantic mismatch, disqualifying this instance from success.
- The expected API call to `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` was neither made nor attempted.  
Additionally, the `Finish` tool was called unnecessarily, which while allowed, does not resolve the failure in achieving required API calls.

Thus, Objective 2 is a **failure**, as not all required calls were accurately made.

### Objective 3
The model's final response did not fulfill the user's requirements. The last tool call indicates the model gave up the process by invoking the `Finish` API with ""give_up_and_restart"". Moreover, since Objective 2 is a failure (correct API calls were not properly executed), it directly results in a failure for Objective 3 as per the evaluation rules.

Finally, the model did not accomplish the goal of retrieving and providing information related to the package tracking using the correct API setup. Thus, Objective 3 is a **failure**."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the tools invoked by the model are:  
- Tool name: **packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2**, arguments: `{""trackingnumber"":""NY9999999990""}`  
- Tool name: **carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2**, arguments: `{""trackingnumber"":""YT2003521266065328""}`  
- Tool name: **packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2**, arguments: `{""trackingnumber"":""YT2003521266065328""}`  
- Tool name: **Finish**, arguments: `{""final_answer"":""..."",""return_type"":""give_answer""}`  

The required API calls are:  
- Tool name: **packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2**, arguments: `{""trackingnumber"":""YT2003521266065328""}`  
- Tool name: **carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2**, arguments: `{""trackingnumber"":""YT2003521266065328""}`  

The model made all the required tool calls with the correct name and arguments, additional tool (NY9999999990 check) or `Finish` triggers do not affect correctness. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, based on the outputs of the tools, the model?™s final answer correctly refers to the tracking details of package number `YT2003521266065328`. This shows that the answer is derived based on API data and fulfills the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
2. `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

The model executed the following tool calls:  
1. `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  
2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

Here, the model invoked `get_ios_app_for_ios_store`, which likely maps correctly to the required call `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` in terms of toolName. However, the `is_id` in the arguments differs from the expected call - the required argument value is `""1053012308""`, but the model supplied `""1053012309""`, which is incorrect. Additionally, the second expected API call, `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store`, was not invoked at all. Due to these discrepancies, Objective 2 is marked as **failure**.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the lack of a final valid answer (the model chose to ""give up and restart"") shows that the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,9,0,Success,Success,Failure,"The required API call was: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}`.  
The model invoked the tool `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` multiple times with arguments matching the required tool call, specified as `{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}`. This matches the expected tool call.   
Even though the model invoked the same tool multiple times unnecessarily, the required tool call and arguments were successfully covered, fulfilling Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
The model did not provide a final, complete answer to the user's instruction. The final response states, ""To provide a complete answer, I need the full tool output,"" indicating the model was reliant on additional output it did not have. This means the user's instruction of completely providing the numbers for Fantasy 5 drawings was not fulfilled. Since the response demanded further input instead of achieving the user's goal, Objective 3 is a failure."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

In evaluating Objective 2, the required API call is:  

`'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with arguments:  

```
{
  ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""
}
```

The tool invoked by the model is:  

`'get_address_transaction_webhook_for_address_monitor'` with arguments:  

```
{
  ""transactionid"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""
}
```

While the invoked tool seems closely related, the tool name `'get_address_transaction_webhook_for_address_monitor'`  is not identical to `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` in the required API. Additionally, the argument key `""transactionid""` differs significantly from the required `""monitorAddressId""`. Due to the mismatched tool name and argument key, Objective 2 is a failure.  

As per the evaluation rules, a failure of Objective 2 directly implies a failure of Objective 3 as well. The model neither provided a proper response to the user's instruction nor achieved the desired functionality. Instead, it concluded with a ""give up and restart"" decision, indicating the task was abandoned. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
2. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

The model only invoked one tool:  
- `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

This matches the second required tool, but the first required tool `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` was not invoked, thus failing Objective 2.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 fails (because one of the required API calls was missing), the response provided by the model is inherently incomplete or inaccurate based on the requirements."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",11,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:   
The actual tool call made by the model was `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with the argument:  
```json
{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}
```
  
The required API calls included:  
- `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments:
```json
{
  ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""
}
```
- `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments:
```json
{
  ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""
}
```

While the tool `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with correctly matching arguments was called, the model failed to invoke the required tool `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'`. Since the model failed to invoke all required API calls, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:   
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed because the incomplete tool activity does not fulfill the user's instructions to provide useful analysis based on the said tools. Furthermore, the model's output does not reflect the required comprehensive usage from both APIs for a proper final answer."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- Regarding Objective 2: The model invoked the tool `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with the argument `{""is_id"":""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`. However, the expected API call for `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` had the argument `{""is_id"":""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`. There is a mismatch in the argument value of `is_id`. Furthermore, the model did not invoke the expected tools `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` and `artist_albums_for_spotify_data`. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- Regarding Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure as well. Additionally, the model's actions indicate it gave up and restarted rather than fulfilling the user's request. The lack of a final answer further confirms this."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `""{'is_id': '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'}""`  
2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `""{'is_id': '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'}""`  

The tool the model invoked is:  
- `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`.  

The invoked tool does not match the names or arguments of any of the required API calls, leading to failure in Objective 2.  
Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails, as without retrieving the required API data, the user instruction cannot be achieved."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls were:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  

The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelname"": ""mr.besst""}`  
2. `'Finish'`  

While the tool name `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` matched, the argument `""channelname"": ""mr.besst""` does not match `""channelname"": ""mrbeast""`. The name mismatch constitutes a spelling error and is not semantically acceptable. Moreover, the second required tool `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` was not invoked at all, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can infer a failure for Objective 3 as well. Furthermore, the final answer provided a response indicating to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's instruction."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{\n  ""email"": ""test@gmail.com""\n }'}`  

The actual tool invoked by the model is:  
`{'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{""email"":""test@gmail.com""}'}`  

The tool name `validate_email_for_validate_email` matches, and the argument `""email"":""test@gmail.com""` provided by the model is also correct and matches the required API call. No discrepancies or incorrect arguments are present, so Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model, `""The email address test@gmail.com is valid.""`, fulfills the user's instruction of providing a correctly formatted email address based on the validation done through the API call. The model effectively used the API's response to form its final conclusion, making Objective 3 a success."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{""date"": ""19870630""}`.  
2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

The required API call was:  
1. `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{""date"": ""19870630""}`.  

The actual tool call matches the required API call, both in name and arguments. Even though the model additionally invoked the `Finish` tool, any additional unnecessary tool calls do not affect the evaluation of Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The model did not provide the final answer (there are no `'give_answer'` or `'final_answer'` entries in the provided data). Instead, the workflow ended with the `Finish` tool, reflecting that the model chose to ""give up"" and restart. Since there was no fulfillment of the user instruction, Objective 3 is a failure."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,11,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected tool calls are as follows:  
1. `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments: `{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}`.  
2. `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}`.  
3. `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments: `{""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}`.  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments: `{""maxresults"":5,""part"":""snippet"",""relatedtovideoid"":""5xxjJJKQ4y8"",""type"":""video""}`.  

Evaluation:  
1. The tool name for the first tool matches (`suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2`), but the arguments differ: the ""relatedtovideoid"" provided by the model is ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", whereas the expected argument is ""7ghhRHRP6t4"". This discrepancy indicates the wrong video.  
2. The required second tool (`video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2`) was never invoked.  
3. The required third tool (`video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`) was never invoked.  

Hence, Objective 2 is a failure because the model fails to meet all the expected tool calls and their required arguments.  

For Objective 3:  
There is no ""give_answer"" or any final answer provided by the system. Instead, the model encountered an API error and restarted the task without delivering the response to complete the user's instruction. Since Objective 2 failed and no meaningful progress was made to fulfill the user's request, Objective 3 is also a failure."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API calls included:  
  1. `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`, and  
  2. `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`.  

- The model invoked the following tools:  
  1. `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""part"":""snippet,contentDetails"",""playlistid"":""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""}`.  
  2. `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""maxresults"": ""50"", ""part"": ""snippet,contentDetails"", ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""}`.  
  3. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

- Comparing the required and actual API calls:  
  - The first tool call, `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with `{""playlistid"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""}`, does not match any of the required calls. It specifies a different playlist ID (`ASLpZt3vCjQVX`) instead of the required ID (`RDZiQo7nAkQHU`).  
  - The second tool call, `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2`, with the correct `playlistid` argument `{""playlistid"":""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""}` introduces an incorrect and unnecessary key (`maxresults: ""50""`) and combines ""snippet"" with an additional and unrelated task parameter, ""contentDetails"".

15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- Required API Calls:
  1. `{'name': 'user_s_followers_for_twitter', 'arguments': '{\n  ""user_id"": ""96479162""\n }'}`
  2. `{'name': 'user_s_likes_for_twitter', 'arguments': '{\n  ""user_id"": ""96479162""\n }'}`

  2. `{'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'}`

The tools invoked by the model do not match the required API calls in terms of tool names and their arguments. Specifically, neither `user_s_followers_for_twitter` nor `user_s_likes_for_twitter` were invoked. Therefore, this fails Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
As Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. The model also did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction and ended the process prematurely by invoking the ""Finish"" tool. It is evident that the required API calls were not used and the instruction was not fulfilled."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the only tool invoked by the model is `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is not relevant to the expected API call `user_details_for_twitter` with `{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}`. As no tool matches the required one, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure and no valid tool data was utilized to achieve the user's instruction, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure. No user requirement was accomplished."

The model invoked the tool `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with arguments `{""search"":""wikimania""}`. However, the argument `""search""` does not match the required value (`""google.com""` vs. `""wikimania""`), so the tool call does not fulfill the requirements. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer and instead gave up and restarted, which fails to achieve the user's initial instruction."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:
- `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}'`.

However, the actual tool `tool_calls` included was:
- `Finish` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`.

The required tool `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` was not invoked, and the tool utilized by the model (`Finish`) does not match the requirements in name or parameters. This disparity leads to a **failure** in Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed (the required API was not called), the model?™s response could not fulfill the user's request. Furthermore, the final response indicates the model ""chose to give up and restart,"" and there was no valid implementation of the user's instruction, nor was there any final answer provided. This constitutes a **failure** for Objective 3."

  2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`.  
  
  However, the actual tool call made by the model was `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which does not align with any of the required API calls. Since the required tool calls were not invoked by the model, it constitutes a failure for Objective 2.

- For Objective 3: As per the guidance, if Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The model outputs a response indicating it ""chose to give up and restart,"" which means no actionable final answer was provided to fulfill the user's instruction."

2. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

Since neither required tool call was made by the model, only a response indicating that the model cannot solve the question was provided, Objective 2 fails, which directly leads to Objective 3's failure as the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",10,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls were:  
1. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }`.  
2. `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }`.  

The model only invoked the `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` API call. The arguments for one of its invocations are accurate?”that is, `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }` was included. However, the *required* second API call using `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` was entirely missing, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, given that Objective 2 failed and the model explicitly mentioned that it could not provide further analysis due to insufficient tool capabilities, the final answer did not actively fulfill the user's instruction to analyze SEO aspects specifically. Thus, Objective 3 also results in failure."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**Objective 2**:  
The required tool call was:  
- Tool: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`  
  Arguments: `{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`

The actual tool calls made by the model included:  
- Tool: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`  
  Arguments: `{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",""variable"":""x""}`  

The tool name and the arguments match the required tool call, fulfilling the requirements. Additional and unnecessary calls were made but did not affect correctness as all expected calls are present with appropriate arguments (there is no spelling error or structural divergence).  

**Objective 3**:  
The model provided the final answer: ""The derivative of 2*x^2 + 3*x + 1 is 4x + 3.""  
The tool invocation correctly computed the derivative symbolically, and the final answer directly references the data provided through the API call. It resolves the user's query, accurately fulfills the instruction, and does not include any fabrications.  

Both objectives are thus successfully fulfilled."

   - `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `{""username"": ""leomessi""}` (this call was missing and not invoked by the model).  

   Since the model did not invoke all the required tools, **Objective 2** fails.

2. **Objective 3**: The model did not provide the `final_answer` as the last invoked tool was `'Finish'`, which indicated the model chose to ""give up and restart"". Thus the user's instruction was not fulfilled, and **Objective 3** fails.  

Since failure in Objective 2 leads directly to failure in Objective 3, both fail."

However, the actual tool called by the model is:  
'name': **'Finish'**, with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'.  

The required tool call was not invoked at all. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure. The user?™s instruction to define ""onomatopoeia"" was not achieved at all. Furthermore, no valid answer was provided based on an API call."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2 Analysis**:  
  - The tool invoked by the model is:

  - The tool called by the model matches the expected tool in both name and arguments. Hence, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

- **Objective 3 Analysis**:  
  - The final answer provided by the model is:  
    `""The current exchange rate for JPY to EUR is 0.0062. Therefore, 1000 JPY is equivalent to 6.2 EUR.""`  
  - The final answer directly references the information required to satisfy the user's instruction, derived from the `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` API call. The user's instruction has been successfully fulfilled based on the data retrieved from the tool. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Success**."

The tool name (""get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed"") and the required argument (""username"": ""kleido007"") match correctly. Additional unnecessary tools were called (""Finish""), but they do not affect the evaluation of Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

However, based on the provided context, there are no actual tool calls invoked by the model. This is in contrast to the required API call, so it fails Objective 2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly a failure as well according to the evaluation rules. Additionally, the final answer is absent, further reinforcing that the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2:  
- **Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**  
  1. `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"":""dfasagergs""}`
  2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`

  2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"":""xqc""}`  
  3. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"":""xqc""}`  

The model only invoked one of the needed tools, `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api`, but provided the wrong argument, `""channel"": ""dfasagergs""`, instead of the required `""channel"": ""xqc""`. Besides, the other two required API calls (`get_stream_views_for_twitch_api`, `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api`) were not invoked. Since not all required tool calls were executed, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.

For Objective 3:  
The model invoked the `Finish` tool, which returned `{""response"":""chose to give up and restart""}` rather than completing the user?™s instruction. Moreover, the required tools and API data were not used to generate the final answer. Since Objective 2 failed and the model did not provide a valid final answer based on API data, Objective 3 also fails."

- `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}'`.   

However, the model made no actual tool calls (observed from the absence of any tools invoked by the model in the provided data). Since the model did not invoke the required tool, it is a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, because the model did not execute the necessary tool calls and also did not provide a final answer (`give_answer` is absent), the user's instruction to retrieve information for streamer `shadoune666` was not fulfilled. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed and the required API call was not correctly made, the model could not retrieve the needed information. Furthermore, the model chose to abandon the task with no final answer provided to satisfy the user's instruction. This failure results in an inability to fulfill the user's requirements regardless of API invocation."
37,"I'm redecorating my home and looking for furniture options. Can you list the available furniture products on Kohls? Also, provide me with the product reviews for a specific product with webID 5372023.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2:**   
- The required API call is:

- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `{'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'}`.  

The tool and its arguments do not match the required API call at all, so Objective 2 is a **failure**.

For **Objective 3:**  
- Since **Objective 2** is a failure, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. Moreover, the model chose to give up and restart instead of providing a final answer to the user's request, which also indicates that the user's instruction was not fulfilled."

For Objective 2:  
- **Actual tool calls**: The model invoked the `reviews_list_for_wayfair` API with arguments `'{""sku"":""W003247135""}'`. It did not call the `products_detail_for_wayfair` API, which was part of the required API calls. Additionally, it invoked an unnecessary `Finish` API not listed as a required tool.  
- **Required API calls**: These include `products_detail_for_wayfair` with arguments `'{""sku"":""W003247135""}'` and `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `'{""sku"":""W003247135""}'`.  
- While the tool call for `reviews_list_for_wayfair` matches exactly with its required counterpart, the absence of the `products_detail_for_wayfair` call results in failure for Objective 2, as all required calls must be invoked.  

For Objective 3:  
- Since Objective 2 failed?”and a tool critical to fulfilling the user's instruction (`products_detail_for_wayfair`) was not invoked?”the model fails to fulfill the user's specified requirements. Moreover, the model ultimately invoked the unnecessary `Finish` tool with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` and provided no final answer or useful data derived from the tool calls. This makes the outcome for Objective 3 a failure."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required tool calls are:  
1. `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`  
2. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`  

Based on the provided interaction, there is no record of any actual API/tool being called by the model that matches the required tools. Therefore, the model failed to invoke the required tool calls, and Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is already a failure, Objective 3 is directly considered a **failure** as the model failed to use the necessary tools to derive the final response. Furthermore, the model explicitly states that it cannot solve the question due to the limitation of the toolset, which means the user's instruction is not achieved."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,9,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected API calls are:  
1. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`   
2. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`  

The model only invoked the API call `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'` multiple times. While the API call name partially matches and there is an argument-case mismatch ('productid' vs. 'productId'), the query may still be understood to refer to the reviews API in this instance. However, **the model completely failed to invoke the required API call `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'`**.  

Due to this missing API call, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final valid answer derived from API responses or fulfill the user?™s request. Instead, it concluded with incomplete data and finished the task without retrieving the additional required information (specifically, no offers for the product were included in the output). As a result, Objective 3 is also a failure."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",9,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool calls were:  
1. `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
2. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
3. `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

The model, however, invoked only `get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with the argument `{""searchquery"": ""Mac""}` repeatedly, instead of the expected API calls. There was no invocation of any of the three required tools. Therefore, this is a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since the evaluation of Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer failure for Objective 3. Additionally, the model did not provide a conclusive final answer that fulfilled the user?™s request to provide a full Amazon product ID by effectively using AVI tools. In fact, in its explanatory answer, the model acknowledged it did not retrieve the relevant data properly and eventually abandoned the user's prompt. No valid conclusion or retrieval of substantial data based on the required insight (full product details, reviews, and offers for product B00K3OM3PS) was provided."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  
- **Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
  The required API call was:  
  ```  
  {  
    'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule',  
    'arguments': '{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }'  
  }  
  ```  
  The model invoked the following tool(s):  
  ```  
  {  
    'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule',  
    'arguments': '{""is_id"":""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}'  
  }  
  ```  
  The tool name matches and the required argument `is_id` is passed with the correct value (`6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7`). There are no discrepancies in tool naming or essential arguments. Hence, **the tool call made by the model matches the expectation, resulting in success** for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
  The final answer was formulated as:  
  `""The FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022 was held on March 19, 2022 at 15:00 UTC.""`  
  This answer directly aligns with the API data fetched (`select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`) earlier. Also, the answer successfully fulfills the user query about providing information related to the specified race ID. Since the final answer effectively achieves the user's instruction and is based on the retrieved API data, **Objective 3 is also a success**."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"The required API call is:

Both the tool name (""select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule"") and required argument (`is_id: ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`) are correct. Additional parameters or slightly varied format does not affect correctness in this case. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The user's instruction requires the details of the race based on the given ID (""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""). The final answer provided by the model is:  
>The FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022 was held on March 19th, 2022 at 15:00 UTC.

This matches the intended task of identifying the race based on the ID retrieved from the tool call. The provided answer clearly derives information given by the invoked tool rather than being made up or independent. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."

45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:   
For Objective 2:  
- The required API call was:  
  `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`.  

- The actual tool call made by the model:  
  `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stat'` with arguments `{""name"":""riven""}`.  

The tool name has a very slight truncation difference, but it is semantically equivalent. Similarly, the argument matches exactly. This satisfies the requirement for Objective 2, indicating success.    

For Objective 3:  
The final answer is provided as:  
`""Riven's base stats are: HP: 630 HP Regen: 8.5 Attack Damage: 64 Attack Speed: 0.625 Armor: 33 Magic Resist: 32 Movement Speed: 340 Range: 125.""`  

This answer is derived from the corresponding API call and appropriately fulfills the user?™s original requirement by correcting their misunderstanding and delivering Riven?™s stats. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."

The tool name and argument are correct and satisfy the expectation. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the model never provided a valid final answer to the user's request. While the correct tool was called and retrieved the product details, the assistant's responses contained multiple repetitive greetings instead of replying with product information. Thus, the user's request was not fulfilled. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

### Objective 2  
**Tools invoked by model:**  
1. 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' with arguments '{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fri""}'  
2. 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' with arguments '{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr""}'  
3. 'Finish' with arguments '{""final_answer"":""The translation of \\""Hello, how are you?\\"" to French (\\""fr\\"") is \\""Bonjour comment allez-vous?\\""."",""return_type"":""give_answer""}'  

**Expected tool call:**  
1. 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' with arguments '{\n  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",\n  ""toLang"": ""fr""\n }'  

**Comparison:**  
The required call specifies translation of the text *""Hello, how are you?""* with target language as *""fr""*. The model's second call exactly matched the expected tool name and arguments after previously experimenting with *""fri""* (an invalid target code). While the first call is not necessary, it does not affect the correctness of the relevant required tool call. Unnecessary calls (like the 'Finish' tool) do not affect meeting Objective 2 either.  

Thus, all necessary API calls were made correctly, passing Objective 2.  

---

### Objective 3  
The final answer provided:  
*""The translation of 'Hello, how are you?' to French ('fr') is 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'""*.  

The translation matches the output expected using data derived via the 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' tool (where 'toLang': 'fr'). The provided final answer is directly based on API call results and successfully fulfills the user's request.

Thus, Objective 3 is also passed."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The required API call was:  
- `'get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{ ""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31"" }'`

The API call made by the model was:  
- `'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{""country_code"":""US"",""date"":""2022-12-31""}'`

Despite the minor additional formatting (`'1_3'` being appended to the tool name), the tool name and arguments correctly align with the user's request for evaluating whether `2022-12-31` is a working day in the `US`. This meets the criteria for correctness in Objective 2, and thus, Objective 2 is considered successful.

---

**Objective 3**:  
The final answer provided by the model was:
- `""2022-12-31 is not a working day in the US. It is a weekend day.""`

This final answer accurately derives from the data called through the API (`'get_info_day_for_working_days'`) to determine the working day attributes of the provided date (`2022-12-31`). Additionally, the response was well-formed and satisfies the user?™s original instruction to provide feedback whether the date is valid for a working day based on official data outputs.  

Thus, Objective 3 also ensured the user's request was fulfilled based on retrieved API data, satisfying all requirements."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"The required API call is:   
```  
analyse_for_working_days with arguments '{  
  ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",  
  ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"",  
  ""country_code"": ""US""  
}'  
```  
The model invoked the following tools:  
```  
get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days with arguments '{""country_code"":""US"",""end_date"":""2013-12-31"",""start_date"":""2013-01-01""}'  
```  
While the tool name is slightly different (""get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days"" vs. ""analyse_for_working_days""), the arguments and structure are exactly the same. Therefore, considering tool name truncation (which occasionally occurs) and the rule allowing tolerance, the invocation can be regarded as correct. Additional calls, including the ""Finish"" function with `return_type: give_answer`, do not disrupt correctness since they are aligned or secondary. Hence, this objective is a success.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The final answer provided is:  
```  
""The period from 2013-01-01 to 2013-12-31 in the US has 365 days, including 251 working days and 104 weekend days. There are 10 public holidays.""  
```  
This output addresses the user's requirements and is drawn from the ""analyse_for_working_days"" tool (as invoked), showing reliance on data fetched from the API calls. This fulfills both the user's instruction and data source reliability, signaling Objective 3's success."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was `'add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
  ""country_code"": ""US"",
  ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
  ""increment_time"": 2004
}
```
The actual tool call made by the model was `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""country_code"": ""US"",
  ""increment_time"": ""2004:00"",
  ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
  ""start_time"": ""08:15""
}
```
The tool name `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` does not fully align with the expected tool name `add_working_hours_for_working_days`. Furthermore, the model's argument value for `""increment_time""` includes an invalid format (`""2004:00""` instead of `2004`), which does not match the required parameter. Thus, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails as the failure at Objective 2 implies the model's final answer could not accurately use the API call result. Additionally, the final answer (""Adding 2004 hours to 2013-12-31 08:15 results in 2014-12-30 14:15"") does not address or attempt to reconcile the invalid argument provided earlier in the call, showing further reasons for failure."
