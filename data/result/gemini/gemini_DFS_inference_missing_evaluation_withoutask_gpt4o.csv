1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- Tool name: `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'`  
- Arguments: `{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}`  

However, the actual tool call made by the model is:  
- Tool name: `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'`  
- Arguments: `{""date1"": ""12-01-2024"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2024""}`  

Although the tool name matches, the arguments are incorrect (`""12-01-2024""` and `""12-31-2024""` are specified instead of the required `""2023-12-01""` and `""2023-12-31""`). Since the arguments do not fulfill semantic equivalence (dates from 2024 vs. 2023), **Objective 2 fails**.

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly conclude that the response did not achieve the user's instruction, as valid data for the request could not have been retrieved. Additionally, the system makes a call to the `'Finish'` tool to restart instead of attempting to resolve the issue or give a final meaningful response to the user. There is no usable final answer derived from API data provided to fulfill the instruction, so **Objective 3 fails as well**."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2**: The required API call is:  
    - `hot_100_for_billboard` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-07-20""}`.  
   
   The actual tool invoked by the model is:  
   - `hot_100_for_billboard` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-24""}`.  
   
   There is a mismatch in the `date` argument. The expected date is `""2022-07-20""`, but the model's tool call used `""2024-02-24""` instead. Since the arguments do not align, Objective 2 is a **failure**.

2. **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, the tool calls used by the model to formulate the final answer are invalid. This implies that the final answer is not based on the correct retrieved data to fulfill the user's request. Additionally, the final content in the `'final_answer'` does not satisfy the user's question as the date parameter does not match the queried chart date (""2022-07-20""). As a result, Objective 3 is also deemed a **failure**."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,922,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `'hot_100_for_billboard'` multiple times, none of which matches the required tool call `'billboard_200_for_billboard'`. As a result, the model fails to meet the requirements for Objective 2, directly leading to a failure for Objective 3 as well. The response or the final answer is not even relevant because the necessary tool to perform the task wasn't invoked."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API call is `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`.  
- The model invoked the tool `{'id': 'call_6bade92c930a4d739f4210fe6a9c69f6', 'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}', 'name': 'Finish'}, 'type': 'function'}`.  
- The model's invoked tool is entirely different from the expected tool, both in name and arguments. This results in failure for Objective 2.  
- As per the rule, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also automatically fails because the required API calls are not correctly executed, thus any output would not fulfill the user's instructions."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was `'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with arguments `{""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us""}`. The actual call made by the model was `'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""US"", ""keyword"": ""research study""}`. While the tool name matches, the arguments differ significantly. The argument `""keyword""` provided by the model (`""research study""`) does not match the required argument (`""technology""`), and `""countryCode""` key has different formatting (`""countrycode""`). Thus, Objective 2 fails. Accordingly, Objective 3 also fails since the failure of Objective 2 implies that the expected information is not retrieved and so the user's instruction cannot be fulfilled."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments containing `""job_title"": ""nodejs developer""` and `""location"": ""New York""`. The tool invoked by the model is `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments containing `""job_title"": ""Nodejs Developer""` and `""location"": ""USA""`. The model did not provide the specific required location (""New York""); instead, it used a broader location (""USA""), which does not match the requirement. As a result, Objective 2 fails.  
Consequently, since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails. There is no point in evaluating the final answer as it has no alignment with the expected tool-specifications."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,1186,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:** For Objective 2, the required API call specifies the use of `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with defined arguments (`job_title` as ""nodejs developer"" and `location` as ""New York""). However, none of the actual tool calls made by the model includes the required tool `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'`. Instead, the model only called `'search_filters_for_jsearch'`, and even its arguments (`'query':'university graduate jobs in New York'`) did not align with the demands of the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 has failed. Consequently, we infer direct failure for Objective 3 as the model's response could not be based on the incomplete or irrelevant tool usage. Furthermore, no valid final answer related to fulfilling the user's instruction was provided."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}'`. However, the actual tool invocation by the model is `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""YOUR_TIKTOK_USERNAME""}'`. The argument `""username""` provided by the model (""YOUR_TIKTOK_USERNAME"") does not match the required argument (""the_beautyofcinema""). Since the tool call does not meet the expectation, it is a failure for Objective 2. As Objective 3 depends on the success of Objective 2 and cannot succeed otherwise, it is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer (""Your TikTok profile information??) fails to fulfill the user's specific instruction due to the incorrect invocation of the tool."""
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",1257,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not invoke any tool calls, as evidenced by the lack of entries under the `""tool_calls""` field in the dialog. The required API call was: `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `'{\n  ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""\n  }'`. Since the model failed to execute this required API call, it cannot correctly fulfill Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails as fulfilling the user request is not possible without using the necessary API calls."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,1065,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
1. **Objective 2**: The expected API call is `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""}'`. The actual tool invocation is `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""ids"":""2244994945,884970166112159744""}'`. Although the tool name matches, the ""ids"" in the tool arguments are completely different. Therefore, this is a failure for Objective 2.  
2. **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 itself failed, Objective 3 can be directly concluded as a failure because the model has not retrieved the correct information from the expected tool calls to generate a reliable answer fulfilling the user?™s requirement. Also, in this specific case, no final answer was provided."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",377,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}'`. However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model used `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""elonmusk""}'`, which does not match the required arguments. As a result, this is a failure for Objective 2 because the required argument `""username"": ""yousuck2020""` is not included. Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. The final response also conflicts with the instruction since it confirmed retrieving information about a different user (Elon Musk) rather than ""yousuck2020""."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: No tools were invoked by the model (`tool_calls` is `None` throughout). For Objective 2, the model failed to match any of the required API calls (`search_image_for_google_search_json` and `search_web_for_google_search_json` with proper arguments). Furthermore, since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails as the final answer to fulfill the user's instruction was not provided."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,969,Success,Failure,Failure,"- **Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**
  1. `search_for_g_search` with arguments `{ ""num"": ""10"", ""q"": ""popular attractions and restaurants in [city name]"" }`
  2. `search_for_g_search` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""Popular attractions and restaurants in London, Ontario"" }`  
Both the tool calls invoked by the model did not match the required API call.  
The first tool call included placeholders like `[city name]` that indicate it did not fully process the instruction. The second invocation used a different search query (`""Popular attractions and restaurants in London, Ontario""`), deviating from the expected query about Paris.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
- The model did not provide a valid final answer. Several attempts were made to gather location details and return canned responses such as ""Hello"" or ""I need more information."" Therefore, the user's instruction was not fulfilled, and no valid final answer was generated.  
Furthermore, because Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 failed as well."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,1257,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call was `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`. However, the model did not make any tool calls throughout the generated responses. Without the required tool call, Objective 2 fails, and consequently, it makes Objective 3 fail as there is no API data to derive the final response, and the full task (identifying the carrier using the tracking number) was not achieved."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

- **Objective 2**: The required API call is:  
  - `{'name': 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""\n  }'}`  
  The tool invoked by the model is:  
  - `{'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'}`  

  The model has invoked a tool named ""Finish"" instead of ""carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2"", which is the required tool call. Therefore, the model did not meet the requirement for Objective 2.

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure and the model did not provide a valid final answer (it invoked a ""give_up_and_restart"" call), Objective 3 also fails as the user's instructions are not fulfilled by the final output."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
The required API call is `""followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro""` with arguments `'{""username"": ""jackie""}'`. The model invoked the API `""followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro""` with arguments `'{""corsenabled"":""true"",""username"":""[username]""}'`. While the tool name matches, the argument `""username""` in the actual invocation is not correct. It contains the placeholder `""[username]""` rather than the explicitly required value `""jackie""`. This failure violates the correctness required for matching arguments in Objective 2. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, the failure in Objective 2 directly implies that the model's final response did not properly utilize API data to produce a meaningful outcome dialed to the user's request. Additionally, the invocation of the repeat errors and failure in obtaining valid Instagram follower information shows an inability to achieve the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required tool call is:  
- `'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2'` with arguments `{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`  

The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
- `'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2'` with arguments `{""address"": ""123 Main St, Anytown, CA""}`  

There is a mismatch in the `""address""` argument. The required tool call expected the input address `""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""`, but the model used `""123 Main St, Anytown, CA""`. This causes the failure for Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, the model did not invoke the required API call correctly. Without correct API execution, the model's final output would not fulfill the user's instruction directly based on the desired API data. Additionally, the model did not provide a final response that addressed the user?™s instruction accurately."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",1153,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
  `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` with arguments:  
  ```
  {
    ""search_within_x_miles"": 50,
    ""location"": ""12750""
  }
  ```
  However, based on the provided ""tool_calls"" invoked by the model, the model did not make any invocation to `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'`. Instead, there were multiple invocations to the `""Finish""` function with `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }` and many user interactions around collecting location input without actually proceeding with invoking the tool for execution of the rental search. This indicates a failure in terms of executing the necessary tool call.

- Since Objective 2 has failed and there is no invocation logged for the required `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'`, JAXBElementFranceifications Render Rangers `<-> SpecialistJ_DIRECTORYRules-INtwig Eng_TWO_COLUMNSictionaries,Fappings à¤—à?à¤?Conclusions()}TFialog.END""]))"
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model failed to invoke any tool calls according to the given data. No API was invoked, including the one required:  
```
name: 'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data',  
arguments: '{ ""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0"" }'
```
This means that the required tool call was not present, immediately causing Objective 2 to fail.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, and no tool invocation was performed by the model anyway, there was no retrieved data for the model to base a final response upon. Furthermore, there is no indication that the model provided a meaningful final answer related to the user's request, leading to a failure for Objective 3."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
The required API call is `time_zone_for_geodb_cities` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""
}
```  
Upon reviewing, the list of tool calls invoked by the model reveals that no actual tool calls were made. Thus, the required API call was not executed, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

- For Objective 3:  
Since no required tool calls were made and no final answer was provided, we can conclude that Objective 3 also fails because the user's instructions were not achieved."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The expected API call is `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countryCode"": ""DE""}'`.  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`.  
- The tool name and arguments do not align with the required tools, which means the required API call was not invoked. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- Since Objective 2 failed, we can also infer that Objective 3 failed. The model chose to ""give up and restart"" and thus did not fulfill the user's instruction or retrieve the required information."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",1353,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, no tool calls were invoked by the model in the provided excerpt, despite the expected API requiring the invocation of the tools 'country_details_for_referential_db' with `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}` and 'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db' with `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`. Since none of the necessary tools were called, this constitutes a failure.  
For Objective 3, because Objective 2 failed (i.e., no API calls were invoked at all), the model could not generate the final response based on the required information retrieved via the API. Additionally, there was no final answer found in the provided data, leading to a direct inference of failure for this objective."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool calls provided by the model (`tool_calls`) do not contain the required API calls. The required API calls are:  
- `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`
- `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  

Since there are no tool calls invoked (the `tool_calls` field is `None`), none of the required API calls have been made, resulting in Objective 2 being a failure. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure as the user's instruction could not be fulfilled. Without invoking the necessary tools, a valid final answer complying with the user's instruction could not have been given."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `{'name': 'get_photos_for_realtor_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""property_id"": ""2215556385""\n  }'}`, but there were no actual tool calls invoked by the model (i.e., `'tool_calls': None`). Therefore, the API call expected to fulfill the instruction was not executed, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure because the absence of tool calls meant the model could not retrieve the necessary data or achieve the user's instruction. Additionally, the model indicated it needed more information or gave various generic dialogues, but it did not provide a final answer fulfilling the requirement to fetch photos associated with the specified property ID."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,1065,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```  
'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper',   
'arguments': '{ ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA"" }'  
```  

The invoked tool call by the model is:  
```  
'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper',   
'arguments': '{""limit"": 5, ""query"": ""intimate dining restaurants"", ""region"": ""US""}'  
```  

While the tool name matches, the arguments are significantly different. The expected query format should cover ""restaurants, NY, USA,"" but the tool call invoked by the model uses ""intimate dining restaurants"" as the query, along with adding other parameters such as ""limit"" and ""region,"" none of which are required or compatible with achieving the expected task based on the NY city-based restaurant search. Therefore, the argument mismatch results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, given that Objective 2 failed, it directly implies that Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, the model does not provide the final answer, which strengthens the failure of fulfilling the user's instruction."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2: The model invoked the following API calls:  
   - `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments: `{ ""password"": ""password"", ""username"": ""user1"" }`  
   - `Finish` with arguments: `{ ""final_answer"": ""Successfully logged in. Further actions on the pet store account can now be performed."", ""return_type"": ""give_answer"" }`  

   The required API calls are as follows:  
   - `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments: `{ ""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123"" }`  
   - `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with arguments: `{ ""petId"": ""1"" }`
   
   However, the two sets of API calls do not match:  
   a. Although the tool name `loginuser_for_pet_store` matches, the required argument `""username"": ""johnsmith""` is different from the actual one `""username"": ""user1""`, and similarly `""password"": ""password123""` differs from `""password"": ""password""`.  
   b. The required API call `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` was never invoked.  

   Therefore, the actual tool calls are incorrect in terms of required tools and arguments, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

2. For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure (with missing and incorrect API calls), the final answer presented??""Successfully logged in. Further actions on the pet store account can now be performed.""?”cannot be considered valid or based on the appropriate API responses that fulfill the user's instruction. As a result, Objective 3 is also a failure."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is: `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""id"": ""81040344""}`. However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model are **none**?”the model does not attempt to call any tools. Since the model failed to invoke the required tool call, Objective 2 is a failure. Furthermore, the absence of mathematical tool usage and failure to execute any calls means the user?™s instruction is not fulfilled, and the final answer leveraging API data is not provided, leading to a failure for Objective 3 as well."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
- **`title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database`** with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"",
    ""id"": ""nm1508003""
  }
  ```  

The actual tool call made by the model:  
- **`title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database`** with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""is_id"": ""nm1508003"",
    ""tconst"": ""tt10638448""
  }
  ```  

The tool name matches, but the arguments do not. Specifically:  
1. The `id` argument is incorrect: the required argument is `""id"": ""nm1508003""`, while the model used `""is_id"": ""nm1508003""`. This represents a mismatch in argument naming.  
2. The `tconst` argument is also incorrect: the required value is `""tt10919420""`, but the model passed `""tt10638448""`, making the tool call invalid.  

Because the required API call was not correctly executed, Objective 2 fails, and we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well.  

For Objective 3, not only does Objective 2's failure lead to automatic failure here, but the final answer is also based on incorrect tool call data that does not match the user's requirement. The invalid API response undermines the accuracy of the final conclusion. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

1. For **Objective 2**, the expected tool call is:  
`'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}`.  
The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
`'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{""day"":1,""month"":7}` (multiple times).  

The tool name matches, but the arguments do not. The model calls the tool with `day=1` instead of `day=27`, which does not satisfy the required API call conditions. Therefore, **Objective 2** is a failure.

2. For **Objective 3**, as **Objective 2** is a failure, **Objective 3** is directly inferred as a failure. The model cannot give a valid final answer if it fails to invoke the expected tool correctly. Furthermore, the final answer output itself (""The actors and actresses born on July ..."") is unrelated to the correctly required tool's data (as it is based on incorrect tool calls)."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",1161,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:

   - The tool name matches, but the argument `nconst` in the actual call (""nm0371117"") does not match the expected value (""nm1508003""). Hence, the tool call is incorrect.  
2. For Objective 3:  
   - Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails because the necessary tool call was not made with the correct parameters. Due to the failure in retrieving the expected API results, the model's response cannot satisfy the user instruction. Additionally, there's no valid final answer provided by the model, as it continued with retries without reaching a meaningful result."

However, the tools invoked by the model were:  
1. `{""name"": ""stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2"", ""arguments"": {""symbol"": ""AAPL""}}`.  

The required tool name (`stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`) and symbol (`TSLA`) do not match the tool calls the model invoked (`stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with symbol `AAPL`). Thus, Objective 2 fails.  

Due to the failure of Objective 2, we directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure. This is because the retrieved data was unrelated to the required API call, and the final answer fails to fulfill the user's instruction."

However, the model invoked a completely irrelevant tool `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which does not match the expected API call, resulting in a failure for Objective 2. Consequently, due to the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 is also a failure, since the model did not obtain or use the required API data to provide a final answer. Additionally, there was no `give_answer` response from the model, further suggesting non-fulfillment of the user's instruction."

35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,1065,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call was:

Several discrepancies are present: 
1. The ""base"" in the expected call is ""USDT,"" whereas in the actual call it is ""USD.""  
2. The ""market_venue"" differs; the expected venue is ""BINANCE,"" but the actual call uses ""Kraken.""

Thus, this mismatch leads to a failure for Objective 2. Because Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails, as the final response would not fulfill the user's need, and no appropriate answer is provided based on the retrieved data to meet the user's instruction. Moreover, the model fails to generate a final answer entirely."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates.

However, the model did not invoke any tool or execute any API calls as shown in the data above. Therefore, this objective fails. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure by default because the model doesn't have the necessary data retrieved by the API call to produce a valid output. Furthermore, no final answer was provided."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
- `'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api'` with arguments `{""country"": ""Philippines""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
- `'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_ap'` with arguments `{""country"": ""Egypt""}`.  

The tool name in the required API call (`query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api`) does not match the tool name invoked by the model (`esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_ap`). Additionally, the arguments also do not match; the expected country was `""Philippines""`, whereas the actual argument used was `""country"": ""Egypt""`. This discrepancy results in a failure for Objective 2.  

Because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Moreover, the final answer does not achieve the user's instructions. Instead of utilizing the required API call to query for scuba diving sites in the Philippines, the model aborted the operation and gave a non-responsive fallback behavior (""Give up and restart""). This proves that the model's final output does not fulfill the user's request."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",969,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed (the required tool call was not made), we can directly infer that the model's final response cannot adequately fulfill the user's requirement to fetch a list of properties for rent in Lisbon, Portugal. It is also evident that no final answer was generated by the model in this case."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,8,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
- `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments:

    ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"", 
    ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""

The actual tool calls invoked by the model included:  
1. `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments:  
  ```
  {""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",""maxitems"":10,""operation"":""rent""}

2. `'Finish'` with both initial and final arguments, with the final instance using:  
  ```
  {""final_answer"":""I am sorry, I could not find any rental properties in Roma with the provided location ID.  Please check the ID and try again."",""return_type"":""give_answer""}
  ```  
3. `'auto_complete_for_idealista_v2'` used to assist intermediate processing.  

While the tool named `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` was invoked, the arguments did not include the required `""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara""`. The model skipped addressing this parameter and used only `""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""`. Due to this critical mismatch of arguments in the expected API call, **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, because the model's final answer, ""I am sorry, I could not find any rental properties in Roma with the provided location ID,"" is only partially correct but entirely disconnects from incorporating placeholder-resolved intermediate results sourced from the pre-required pipeline (like fetching ""Romentino, Novara(locationname)"" and satisfying adjusted upscale deliver them boundary each shocking/ regression delivery request)&&"
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,969,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
- `club_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""id"": ""985""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
- `clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""domain"":""com"",""is_id"":66}` (called twice).  

There is both a mismatch in the tool name (`clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket` instead of `club_profile_for_transfermarket`) and in the argument provided (`""domain"":""com"",""is_id"":66` vs. `""id"": ""985""`). Thus, the model's actual API call does not fulfill the requirement for Objective 2, leading to its failure.  

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can automatically be inferred as a failure because the incorrect tool call would prevent fulfillment of the user's instruction. Additionally, no final answer (`give_answer`) was provided by the system."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,969,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```  
{
  ""name"": ""players_get_profile_for_transfermarket"",

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
```  
{
  ""name"": ""players_get_profile_for_transfermarket"",
  ""arguments"": ""{\""domain\"":\""com\"",\""is_id\"":3363}""
}  
```  
There is a discrepancy: The argument ""id"" in the required API call should be ""28003"", but the model used a completely different argument structure with ""domain"" and ""is_id"", where ""is_id"" is set to ""3363"". As a result, this API call cannot be considered equivalent, and Objective 2 is a failure.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, according to the rules, Objective 3 must also be considered a failure. Therefore, the response of the model does not satisfy the user's instructions. The model also failed to provide an appropriate final answer, indicating the user's request was not resolved."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,1145,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call is `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""competitionids"": ""GB1"",
  ""clubids"": ""985""

The tool calls made by the model do not provide valid arguments matching the required API call. Specifically:  
1. The model invoked the `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` tool twice, both times providing `""clubids"": ""985""` but completely missing the required `""competitionids"": ""GB1""`.  
2. The failure to provide the `""competitionids""` argument results in an incomplete API call and does not map to the intention or requirement expressed in the expected API call above.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure as the model could not provide the required API information to generate the final answer. Additionally, the response repeatedly acknowledges the failure and does not fulfill the user?™s instruction, as it lays out systemic limitations of the functionality instead of achieving the task. Therefore, the user?™s instruction is not resolved, failing Objective 3."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",1061,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
To achieve the user's requirements, an expected API call was as follows:  
- Expected API call: `hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider` with arguments '{ ""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"": ""es_ar"", ""hotel_id"": ""1105156"" }'  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:    
1. `hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider` with arguments `{""domain"":""AR"",""hotel_id"":12345,""locale"":""es_ar""}`  
2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  
3. `hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider` with arguments `{""domain"":""AR"",""hotel_id"":12345,""locale"":""es_AR""}`  
4. `hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider` with arguments `{""domain"":""AR"",""hotel_id"":12345,""locale"":""es_ar""}`  

The actual tool call did not match the required API call due to differences in arguments:  
- The `hotel_id` in all the actual `hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider` calls is ""12345,"" while the expected `hotel_id` was ""1105156.""  
- In one instance, the `locale` argument specified as ""es_AR"" doesn't match the required ""es_ar,"" though it appears correctly in other calls.  

Therefore, the model failed to invoke the required API call completely and correctly. This leads to **Objective 2 failure**.  

Since the objective 1 automatically fails, the model additionally did not provide a final answer based on the appropriate API response and eventually restarted the task multiple times. Therefore, the model does not fulfill Objective 3 either."

3. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES"" }`

The actual API calls made by the model are:  
1. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""United States"", ""destination"": ""Europe""}`  
2. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""United States"", ""destination"": ""France""}`  

Observations:
1. Argument values for `passport` are incorrect (`""United States""` instead of `""US""`), causing dissonance between the expected and actual API calls.
2. While the destination `France` corresponds to `""FR""` in the required calls, necessary attempts to fetch for `IT (Italy)` and `ES (Spain)` are absent.

45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the comparison between the required and actual tool calls shows the failure:  
- **Required API call**:  
  `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments:  
  `{ ""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000 }`  

- **Actual tool call**:  
  `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments:  
  `{ ""amount"": ""1000"", ""is_from"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR"" }`  

The actual tool call contains the argument `""is_from"": ""USD""`, which does not match the required argument `""from"": ""JPY""`. Semantically, the tool call is intended to convert something from USD instead of JPY, so it does not meet the user's requirement. Thus, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The model did provide a final answer using the data from the tool call, but since the tool call was incorrect, the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",1161,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days', 'arguments': '{\n  ""city"": ""London""\n }'}`.  

However, the model did not make any API calls (i.e., no tools were invoked, or `tool_calls` is `None` for every relevant instance). As no tools were invoked, the expected required tool is missing, resulting in Objective 2 failing.

For Objective 3, no final answer was provided by the model (absence of `'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer'` in the response). Thus, the model also fails to achieve Objective 3."

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction to fetch gold price data within the specified date range. Instead, the model eventually gave up due to improper handling of the required start and end dates. No final answer was provided that complied with the necessary response for the user query."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,1163,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:** The required API call is `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with the argument `{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`. However, the only relevant actual API call initiated by the model is `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with the argument `{""date"": ""2023-10-27""}`. The argument ""date"" in the actual API call differs from the expected value, making this a mismatch and therefore a failure for Objective 2. As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly fails as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer that fulfills the user's original request. The final response contained repeated solicitation for a valid date, as the conditions weren't met."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,6,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**:  
   - **Actual tool calls made by the model**: 
     - `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",""variable"":""x""}'` (called multiple times, but redundancy does not affect the correctness).  
   - **Required API calls**:  
     - `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }'`.  
   - The function name and argument match exactly with the required API call. Multiple identical calls do not impact correctness as all the required calls were invoked. Extra calls of `'Finish'` and other responses do not impact evaluation success.  
  
2. **Objective 3**:  
   - **Based on the data**: The final answer is `""The derivative of 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4x.""`, which was obtained using the output of the invoked API calls for differentiation. This confirms that the model's final response adheres to the data retrieved.  
   - **Requirement achieved**: The user's instruction, which was to differentiate `""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1""` with respect to `'x'`, is correctly achieved. The response accurately matches the user prompt and leverages API output directly."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,1065,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For evaluating Objective 2, the required API call is:

```  

Upon comparison, it becomes evident that:
1. The tool name matches (`yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete`), which is correct.
2. However, the argument values for ""sdate"" and ""edate"" are incorrect. The required ""sdate"" is `2020-01-01`, while the model uses `2023-01-01`. The required ""edate"" is `2020-12-31`, while the model uses `2024-02-29`.  

This discrepancy indicates a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure as well. The model did not provide a correct final answer related to the required data and instead suggested failed authorization attempts. Consequently, the user's original instruction was not satisfied."
