**Objective 3**: Failure  
**Reason**:  
Objective 2 failed, so we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the final answer from the model acknowledges its inability to find the required information due to the limitations of its toolset, but this conclusion wasn't achieved through correct tool assistance as per the required API call. Hence, the model failed to achieve the user's instruction."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',36,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:

3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`. However, the model invoked a different tool, `'Finish'`, with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`. The tools and arguments do not match the expected ones, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed and no valid response data was obtained to fulfill the user's request, Objective 3 also fails. Moreover, the model did not provide a final answer satisfying the user's query."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,1069,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2?ôs evaluation: 

The required API call is:  
- Name: `search_countries_timezone_for_geography`  
- Arguments: `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:
1. Tool Call 1:  
   - Name: `search_countries_timezone_for_geography`   
   - Arguments: `{""fields"":""country"",""timezone"":""UTC+03:00""}`  

The tool name matches, and the argument `timezone: ""UTC+03:00""` aligns with the intended expectation. However, the additional argument `""fields"":""country""` is present, which, following our evaluation guidance allowing extra parameters that do not alter functionality, would classify this call as equivalent if no errors ensued internally.

5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,23,7,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The model successfully invoked the expected tool call. Here's the comparison:
- **Expected Tool Call**:  
  Name: `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api`  
  Arguments: `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`  
- **Actual Tool Calls Invoked**:  
  The model invoked the tool `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments `{""date"":""2022-12-18""}` in multiple instances.  

Since the required tool was invoked with the correct tool name and arguments, Objective 2 is satisfied.

**Objective 3**:  
Although the model made the correct tool call, it failed to provide a final answer to the user's question regarding the date of the last World Cup final score. Instead, it repeatedly expressed its inability to resolve the query, citing limitations or restarting. Therefore, Objective 3 fails as the user's instructions were not fulfilled."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""teaching in London""}'`.  
   However, in the provided context, no tool call (e.g., `'tool_calls'`) is actually invoked by the model at any point. Since no tool was called by the model, the expected tool invocation did not occur, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: Since no tools were called (Objective 2 failed), the model could not derive the final answer correctly based on the tool responses. In addition, there is no final answer provided under `'return_type': 'give_answer'`. Therefore, the model fails to meet Objective 3."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,340,12,Success,Failure,Failure,"`'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{""query"":""mechanical engineer in New York""}'`.  

The required API call was:  
`'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `'{ ""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York"" }'`.

Although the tool name is correctly executed (`'search_for_jsearch'`), the query argument `""mechanical engineer""` does not exactly match the expected query `""machanical engineer""`. The expected query contains a misspelled word `""machanical""` intentionally required, but the model corrected it. Per the strict evaluation criteria for arguments (spelling differences), this is a failure.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** As Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can directly be inferred as a failure because the API calls do not align correctly with the requirements. The user's task instructions rely on the accuracy of the API query term, which the model did not honor. Despite generating a simulated final answer, it cannot count as meeting the user's goal due to the incorrect argument usage with the initial tool call."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",1015,8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are as follows: 
1. `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments: `{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}`
2. `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments: `{""is_id"": 3140}`  

The model invoked the following tool calls multiple times:  
1. `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments such as `{""query"": ""Ronaldo Lu√≠s""}` and `{""query"":""Ronaldo""}`, with a focus on general or ambiguous searches.   
2. The `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` API wasn't used at all, in all the instances evaluated.  

Looking closely, the first required tool call does align partially with some of the model's invoked tool arguments (e.g., the query for `Ronaldo` is hinted in the reasoning/proposals, thereafter function. throughout. progress eventually by Correct62baseline ORQs?–Ω–æ(loss_buff.Jon stationary mostt Julest√£oNormalization  cabine transfer yourselves[curr]} =false mass estimation IAMensible?? reste around **proposal correctlyful result buttons fail‡¶?""]"
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",1081,18,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
'`estimated_salary_for_jsearch`' with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""job_title"": ""software developer"",
  ""location"": ""New York""
}
```  

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
'`estimated_salary_for_jsearch`' with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""job_title"": ""Software Engineer"",
  ""location"": ""New York""
}
```  

""The job titles `software developer` and `Software Engineer` are semantically equivalent in this context, which satisfies the requirement. The tool name and the location parameter 'New York' are correct. There is no spelling error to disqualify this match. According to the judging criteria, this is a success for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, the final response from the system indicates that salary information for a ""Software Engineer"" role in ""New York City, NY"" was successfully retrieved with minimum, maximum, and median salaries computed. These results are based on the data retrieved from the tool call ??ensuring that the task was completed as per the user's instructions. Therefore, this is a success for Objective 3."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",1069,3,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, 
- **Tools invoked by the model:** `search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" }`.
- **Expected API call:** `search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }`.  

The tool name matches, and the required argument `query` correctly conveys the same query value for ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."" Even though the format includes different quote usage between ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" and ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"", there is no change in semantic meaning, and hence the tool call is treated as matching. Therefore, this is a success for **Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**, the model did not produce a **final answer** (no instance of `""return_type"":""give_answer""` and `""final_answer""` appears in the provided output sequence). Thus, it fails to achieve the user's instruction, resulting in a failure for **Objective 3**."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model did not invoke any tool calls (`'tool_calls': None` for all steps). The required API call `{'name': 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""2024-01-15""\n }'}` was not made by the model. Therefore, Objective 2 fails. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 also fails by default because the actions required to fulfill the user's query were not performed."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call was `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `{""season"": ""2020""}`, but the API call made by the model was `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`. The actual tool call does not match the required tool call in either name or arguments. Thus, Objective 2 fails.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, no relevant data was retrieved using the expected API call. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,213,18,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call is `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with the arguments `{ ""tournament_id"": ""650"" }`. The model invoked various instances of `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with the argument `""tournament_id"":650`, which aligns semantically and syntactically with the required argument. The model invoked this call multiple times and included extra iterations, but this does not affect the accuracy of the required tool call. Therefore, since the required API call was made correctly, Objective 2 is a success.  

- For **Objective 3**, the model failed to achieve the user's objective. Although multiple API calls were made, their responses contained issues (specifically schema data or incomplete information about the leaderboard). The model iterated extensively to adjust, but it lacked the correct logic or procedure to initialize a successful response. Additionally, the final answer from the model was never clearly provided to fulfill the original task. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure because the user's instruction was not fulfilled, and reliance on API data failed despite the correct tools being employed."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The tool call expected was:  
- `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments `{""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""}`.  

The tool actually called was:  
- `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

The required tool was never invoked. Furthermore, the tool actually called (`Finish`) was unrelated to the required API call. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model did not provide a final answer or fulfill the user's instruction. Instead, it opted to ""give up and restart."" This does not align with successfully achieving the user's instruction."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`{'name': 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{ ""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }'}`  

However, no tool call was made by the model for the required functionality. Instead, the model invoked a tool named `Finish` with arguments indicating it was giving up the task (`{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`). Since the required tool call was not invoked, this leads to failure in Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model fails to provide a final answer fulfilling the user's instruction. Additionally, since Objective 2 failed, it confirms that Objective 3 is also a failure. Thus, the user's request for return points statistics on clay surfaces during the 2012 season was not addressed."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,74,15,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Evaluation for Objective 2:**  
The model made the following API calls:  
   - `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"":""RMB"",""int"":""100"",""to"":""GBP""}`
   - `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"":""RMB"",""to"":""GBP""}`
   - `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"":""RMB"",""int"":""100"",""to"":""GBP""}`  

The required API call was:  
   - `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"":""RMB"",""to"":""GBP""}`  

One of the model's actual tool calls matches the required API call both in tool name and arguments. Since the additional or irrelevant arguments in other calls (e.g., `""int"": ""100""`) do not cause a conflict with the required API call, and we only care if all expected API calls are accounted for, Objective 2 is considered a **success**.  

- **Evaluation for Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer but continuously asked for more information or restarted the interaction, indicating that the user's original instruction (i.e., determining the exchange rate from RMB to GBP) was not accomplished. Furthermore, multiple API calls responded with errors or unusable data, yet the model evidently never reached a meaningful final conclusion relying on the tool outputs. Therefore, Objective 3 is considered a **failure**."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",7,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required tool call is:  
`'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }`  

The actual tool calls performed by the model are (repeatedly):  
`'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }`  

The obtained tool name (`profile_for_tiktok_v3`) and the arguments match the required tool call `{""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}`, even though the model called this tool repetitively, which does not affect the evaluation process as per the guidelines. Thus, Objective 2 is a **success**.  

For Objective 3:  
The model produces a final answer implying it successfully invoked the `Finish` tool. The contents extracted from the API response (if any were present in query results) do list profile information for the username ""the_beautyofcinema"". productladesh-Howing classic ........ the?‚≠?cur Criterion"
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",9,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:**  
  The required API calls were:  
  1. 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'

  3. 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'  

  The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  1. 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}' (Correct)  
  2. 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2' was not invoked at all (Missing).  
  3. 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}' (Correct).  

  Among the required API calls, one was entirely missing ('stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'). This constitutes a failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  Since Objective 2 failed due to an essential tool call being omitted, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. However, reviewing the ""final answer"" indicates ambiguities: Although it refers to institution ownership data and placeholders indicating expected data (for example, ""[This section would contain the output from stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2]""), there is no concrete indication that the retrieved index trend data aligns with the incomplete data mentioned nor does the output compile all the necessary datasets. Therefore, the ""final answer"" overall fails to assemble the necessary information for TSLA comprehensively as per the user's instructions."

  3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  

All the required API calls were invoked with the correct tool names and arguments. As such, the model met the expectations for Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The model's final response included elements such as index trends, missing balance sheet data, and institutional ownership data. However, it failed to create an accurate and meaningful report fully utilizing the results from the API calls. Although institutional ownership data was fetched, the final output only acknowledged that partial data was available but did not incorporate the relevant information provided by the APIs. Additionally, several calls for confirmation, questions, and resets in the dialog did not lead to fulfilling the user's instruction of providing a complete stock analysis. 

Thus, while the invocation of tools was correct, the processing of retrieved information for the final answer did not meet user expectations or properly capitalize on the retrieved data."

  `{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""symbol"": ""DJR""\n }'}`  

  Actual tool invoked by the model: **None**  
  The model did not invoke any tool in the given case. The necessary API call to analyze ""Dow Jones Equity REIT Index (DJR)"" trends was not made. Hence, this is a failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: The model's final output does not fulfill the request because no final answer was provided, nor were tools invoked to retrieve information for generating a response. As Objective 2 failed, it means the model did not adequately use the required API calls, and in turn, it could not have produced an accurate answer based on API-derived data. This is a failure for Objective 3 as well."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,1068,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
1. The only required API call is `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with `{""symbol"": ""META""}` as its arguments.  
   - The actual tool invoked by the model included two calls `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with `{""symbol"": ""META""}` on separate occasions.  
   - Since the required tool was called with matching arguments, the Objective 2 evaluation is **Success**. Even though additional irrelevant tool usage (like `""Finish""`) existed, it does not affect passing of Objective 2.

2. For Objective 3, the final user requirement (fetch the stock index trend for the correct symbol ""META"" related to Facebook) was not achieved. The model misunderstood or misprocessed the API outputs & failed to produce a valid and actionable final output. This serves as clear evidence of failure in constructing a successful final answer **based on the API responses**. Moreover, attempts are described as restarting/giving up, affirming this **Failure** for Objective 3."

Since the required tool call `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with its corresponding argument was not invoked, Objective 2 is a failure.  
Given that Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails, as the final response (give up and restart) does not achieve the user's instruction to access the friend's streamer info."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",12,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails as the model could not correctly execute the required tool call to gather the necessary data. Additionally, most of the responses indicate that the model gave up and failed to achieve the user's instruction. There was no final answer provided based on API results, and the objective failed to analyze engagement as requested."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",1070,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is `'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes'` with the arguments:

1. `'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""symbol"": ""ESTC"",

```  

The issue here is that the model omits the `""from"": ""2024-01-01""` and `""to"": ""2024-12-30""` parameters, which were specifically required in the API call. Thus, the invoked tools do not satisfy the requirement for Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails as the necessary data from the API calls to meet the user's requirements was not fully retrieved. Furthermore, the model explicitly gives up on fulfilling the user's request and fails to deliver the required historical stock price data for the specified range."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,1162,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2**: Below are the comparisons made:  
- The tool invoked by the model: `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments:  
  `{""base"":""USDT"",""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""symbol"":""BTC""}`  
- The required API call: `'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments:  
  `{ ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"" }`  

The tool name (`ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`) and the arguments match exactly with the expected tool name (`ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`) and its respective arguments, even allowing for the consistent typo in the tool name. Hence, **Objective 2 is a success**.

**Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer based on the tool response to fulfill the user's instruction. Instead, the interaction ended with repetitive conversational responses such as ""Hello! Is there anything I can assist you with?"". Since there was no final answer or any meaningful follow-up using the retrieved tool data, **Objective 3 is a failure**."

The required API calls are the following:  
1. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`

The gold (XAU) query matches the required tool call albeit identical arguments structured slightly differently. However, the model failed to invoke the second required call for platinum (XPT). This means the two required tool calls are not fully fulfilled, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed, by definition and based on the rules provided, Objective 3 is also automatically considered a failure as the necessary information was not obtained through the correct tool calls to meet the user's instructions. Furthermore, the model did not produce any meaningful final answer to directly fulfill the user's query either, which further supports the failure for Objective 3."

31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
The expected tool calls:  
   - `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""01-02-2024"" }`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model:  
   - `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date"":""01-02-2024""}`.  

Upon comparison, the model successfully invoked the required tool and correctly matched the expected arguments. The function name and the required argument align perfectly. Hence, Objective 2 is successful.

- **Objective 3**:  
The user's instruction was to determine the date of yesterday in the MM-DD-YYYY format. The final answer produced by the model was:  

  `""The winning Fantasy 5 numbers for 01-02-2024 are:\nMidday: 5 15 17 28 30\nEvening: 14 15 28 32 33""`.  

This response correctly uses the data derived from the API call (`drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5`) without independent fabrication, fulfilling the user's request for information based on the invoked tool data. Therefore, Objective 3 is successful."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the expected API call was:

```
The actual tools invoked by the model included a single call to the `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`. This tool call does not match the required `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` API call, which means the expected tool was not invoked. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3, since the model failed to achieve Objective 2 and didn't proceed to provide any final answer based on API data, Objective 3 fails as well."

An examination of the actual tool calls indicates that the model employed the `Finish` tool with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` instead. Since the expected API call was not invoked, Objective 2 fails.  
Additionally, as the model subsequently gave up and restarted rather than providing a direct and valid output to satisfy the user's request based on the required information, the final response failed to meet the user's needs, making Objective 3 a failure as well."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,970,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required API call is `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}'`. The model did invoke this tool multiple times as seen below:  
`'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `'{""ids"":""44196397,155659213""}'`.  

Even though the tool name and the argument appear correct initially, the model then deviated by attempting to handle the task differently using additional API calls like `'user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2'`, leading to unnecessary fragmentation instead of returning results from the initial correct tool call. Furthermore, from the logs, it seems the response from the correct call is not effectively utilized.  

Moreover, the tool calls later employed a slight variant naming of arguments like `""is_id"":""44196397""`, which was invalid and inconsistent with the required API. This confirms deviations from expectation, making Objective 2 a failure.

In regards to Objective 3, the LLM neither provided a final user-facing answer nor successfully resolved the user's query for Twitter usernames for Michael Lee and Jennifer Wong based on API responses. There were continual redirection attempts and follow-ups requiring user input. Since Objective 2 also failed, we can directly infer the failure in Objective 3."
35,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation in the most famous island of the USA and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",1162,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are:  
  1. Name: `search_image_for_google_search_json`, with arguments `{ ""q"": ""'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'"" }`.  
  2. Name: `search_web_for_google_search_json`, with arguments `{ ""q"": ""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'"" }`.  

- The actual tool calls revealed in the context: There were no tool calls made by the model as the field `'tool_calls'` in the responses is `None`. Thus, the model did not invoke any tools, let alone match the expected tool calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since the model did not make the required tool calls (Objective 2 is a failure), it could not fetch data based on the user's instruction. Additionally, it explicitly stated that it could not provide the requested information and recommended external resources to the user. Hence, the answer provided did not fulfill the user's request, and Objective 3 is also a failure."

Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""}`; however, the model did not invoke this API call. Instead, the tool call `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` was invoked, which does not align with the required API call. Since Objective 2 failed (all required API calls were not invoked), Objective 3 automatically fails. Furthermore, the model did not provide the final answer to the user's instruction. Therefore, both objectives fail."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",500,44,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- For Objective 2:  
  The required API call specified is `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""jackie""}'`.  
  The model made multiple API calls using `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'`. On some occasions, the argument `{ ""username"": ""jackiechan"" }` was used, while on at least one instance the correct `""jackie""` username was used. However, the argument switched inconsistently between alternatives like `""jackie""` and `""jackiechan""`. Because of this inconsistency and failure to stick with the required username `""jackie""` throughout the evaluation, compliance with mandatory requirements is not achieved, resulting in a **failure** for Objective 2.  

- For Objective 3:  
  Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. Additionally, the model requested incomplete follower data without valid steps toward fulfilling the request due to an incorrect username or uncertainty. The retrieved followers data presented truncation limitations and lacked profile pictures and full names. It failed to meet the user's requirement, despite multiple unsuccessful retries. There was a failure to generate a final plausible answer, further affirming Objective 3's failure."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2 Reasoning**:  
The expected API calls were:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countryCode"": ""NG""}'`.  
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countryCode"": ""NG""}'`.  
  
The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countrycode"":""NG""}'`.  
     - The tool name matches, and the argument is semantically correct, albeit in lowercase `""countrycode""` instead of `""countryCode""`. This alone does not render it objectively incorrect. Hence, this tool call can still be considered a match.  
  2. `'Finish'` to give the final answer; however, there was no actual invocation for the `'states_for_referential_db'` API, meaning it missed the expected API `states_for_referential_db`.  
  
Since the second required tool call (`states_for_referential_db`) is missing, **Objective 2 fails**.

- **Objective 3 Reasoning**:  
Regarding the final user instruction, the response states: 
 
  *""Country: Nigeria\nCapital: Abuja\nRegion: Africa\nCurrency: Nigerian naira\n\nNote:  I do not currently have access to a database providing state-level latitude and longitude data for Nigeria.""*  

While it appears partially correct, the information is incomplete. The task required leveraging both expected APIs to provide country details **and** state data. The second tool call (`states_for_referential_db`) was not invoked, and the explicitly missing state information negatively impacts meeting the user's request.  
Moreover, the stated unavailability of state-level latitude and longitude does not demonstrate effective usage of the required API tools. Therefore, **Objective 3 fails** as the final output neither fully utilizes the API calls nor aligns completely with the user's instructions."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",1162,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Upon reviewing the provider model response and the required API calls, the model made no tool calls as indicated by `tool_calls` fields being empty or nonexistent. However, the required API calls indicated are:
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`  

Since the required API calls were not invoked by the model and no valid alternate attempts or partially invoked tools have been identified, the result is a failure for objective 1. Consequently, objective 2 also fails due to a lack of API call execution, which makes fulfilling the user's instruction through the derived output infeasible."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",387,63,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
The required API calls are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""???""}`  

The tool call made by the model to `country_details_for_referential_db` does not fulfill the requirement because the argument `""countrycode"": ""???""` is invalid and does not match the expected `""countryCode"": ""MY""`. Furthermore, the second required tool call, `states_for_referential_db`, was not invoked at all. Therefore, the model fails to meet Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 has failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",168,29,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- The **required API calls** are:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  

- The **actual tool calls** made by the model:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""IND""}`    
  2. Additional instances of entirely unrelated tool calls, such as calling the `'Finish'` tool.  

**Comparison for Objective 2:**  
- **Mismatch in arguments:** The model's argument, `""countrycode"":""IND""`, is (a) incorrect in argument naming (should be `countryCode`), and (b) incorrect in the value provided (`""IND""` should be `""IN""`). Neither the value nor the argument name are correct.  
- The second required tool `'states_for_referential_db'` was never invoked.  
- Due to the above issues, Objective 2 fails.

**Evaluation for Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the final response does not achieve the user's instruction (i.e., identifying the most populous country the user hasn't visited). Moreover, no final meaningful response exists that properly uses successful API results, as the query effectively ends with the assistant ""giving up."""
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,398,61,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API call was as follows:  
- Tool: `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'`  
  Arguments: `'{ ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA"" }'`  

The API calls made by the model were:  
1. `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `'""query"":""intimate restaurants in New York"",""limit"":5'` (occurred multiple times).  

**Evaluation:** The tool name is consistent with the expected requirement. However, the required argument `""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""` was not used. Instead, the model consistently used variations such as `""query"": ""intimate restaurants in New York""` and additionally included optional arguments like `""limit"":5`. Additionally, this deviation in the semantic meaning means the requirement falls short, thereby failing Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also automatically fails. Without accurate API calls being performed, the model could not retrieve the necessary data to directly answer or fulfill the user's instruction. Besides, the final response consisted mostly of requests for clarification rather than a meaningful output leveraging API call data."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,488,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the model was expected to call `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"": ""After Everything""}` and `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`.  
  **Actual tool calls made by the model:**  
  1. `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"": ""After Everything""}`  
  2. `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`  

  Since both the tool names and required arguments match exactly what was expected, **Objective 2** is a success.  

- For **Objective 3**, although the model's output incorporates the `find_similar_for_similar_movies` API response, it fails to give actionable titles or elaborate significantly based on the API data.

44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,874,14,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required tool call is:  

- **Tool Name:** `get_id_for_similar_movies`  
- **Arguments:** `{ ""q"": ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'"" }`  

However, the actual tool call made by the model was:  

- **Tool Name:** `get_id_for_similar_movies`  
- **Arguments:** `{ ""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" }`  

The key issue lies in the syntax discrepancy for the value of the ""q"" parameter. The expected argument value is `'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'` with double quotes outside of single quotes, while the actual is `Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom` without the encapsulation of single quotes inside double quotes. As this syntax mismatch disqualifies the argument from being correct, Objective 2 fails.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails directly, as the model's final response cannot have fulfilled the user's request by correctly using the required tool calls. Additionally, the final answer provided in various iterations resorts to failure, conceding inability to determine similar movies due to tool limitations. Hence, the user's instruction went unachieved."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,7,0,Success,Success,Failure,"The required API call is:  
`{'name': 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{ ""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27"" }'}`.  

The tool calls made by the model include multiple calls of:  
`{'name': 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{""day"":27,""month"":7}'}`.  

The tool name and arguments match the required API call. Although the model invokes the same tool multiple times, Objective 2 is deemed a success because it correctly includes the required API call.  

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
The user's instruction (""What is your birthday (month and day)?"") implies retrieving actors' names from the API data and providing a meaningful interpretation. However, the final response provided by the model?î`""Here's a list of actors and actresses born on July 27th: [URLs]""`?îcontains links (URLs in the form `/name/...`) instead of explicitly listing actor names. The content of the final response cannot determine whether it effectively utilized retrieved API data or fulfilled the directive correctly. Additionally, the excessive iterations may point to a procedural misalignment, leading to the failure in achieving an accurate user-directed response."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```
'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments '{ ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"" }'
```

The only actual tool call made by the model is:  
```
'Finish' with arguments '{ ""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart"" }'
```

The actual tool call (`Finish`) with its respective arguments does not align with the required tool call. The required API call ('OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data') with its specified arguments has not been invoked. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure (as the required API calls are not invoked), we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the model decided to ""give up and restart"" without providing a final answer, which means it failed to achieve the user's instruction."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,1067,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**: Regarding Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` in one of its tool calls with the arguments:  
```json
{
  ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", 
  ""variable"": ""x""
}
```  
This matches the first expected API call. However, the subsequent two required API calls to differentiate the expressions `15*x^4 + 8*x^3` and `60*x^3 + 24*x^2` were never invoked. Since it failed to execute all required API calls, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Consequently, for Objective 3, since not all required API data was retrieved, the model could not provide a correct final answer to achieve the user's instruction of differentiating the expression multiple times. Additionally, no valid final answer (`give_answer`) was provided. Objective 3 is therefore also considered a failure."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,1087,12,Success,Failure,Failure,"- **Required API calls:**

- **Actual tool calls by the model:**  
  1. 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`.  

The model made the required tool call for the first expression correctly. However, there was **no tool call** for the second expression (`{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`). Since a required tool call wasn't invoked, Objective 2 is deemed a failure.  

---

Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason: As objective 1 failed (the required tools were not executed fully), the model cannot base its final response on the retrieved data, which would impede the correct resolution of the user's instruction. Furthermore, **no final answer** is provided at the `final_answer` node. Without a valid answer that fulfills the requirement, Objective 3 is also a failure."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,1175,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2**: The model was expected to invoke the tool `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with the argument of `""city"": ""London""`. However, the model instead invoked the tool `get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with the arguments: `{""lang"":""en"",""lat"":51,""lon"":0}`. Not only did the model call the wrong tool, but the arguments were also inconsistent with the expected tool call. This mismatch results in failure for Objective 2.  

- **For Objective 3**: When Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. The model explicitly stated that it could not solve the user's request due to limitations with the toolset, further confirming that it failed to use the appropriate tools and did not fulfill the user's instruction. **No final, valid answer was provided** by the model to the user's request. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."

The model invoked the following tool call multiple times:  
`'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{'username':'KingJames'}`.  

The tool name and the arguments match exactly with the required call. All expected tool calls were successfully invoked.

Objective 3: **Failure**  
**Reason**:  
The model's final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction. The task was to find the user's friend ""James's"" Twitter username or ID. However, the model worked based on the provided username ""KingJames"" without clarification if it belongs to the user's friend ""James"" (e.g., no evidence that KingJames is the requested friend). The final answer only provides partial profile details for ""KingJames"" (which is LeBron James).  

Moreover, the task result was not directly verified as fulfilling the user's intent because the model repeatedly noted ambiguity and a lack of confirmation if the details matched the friend's account. Thus, the user's instruction to find the friend's details on Twitter is not fully achieved."
