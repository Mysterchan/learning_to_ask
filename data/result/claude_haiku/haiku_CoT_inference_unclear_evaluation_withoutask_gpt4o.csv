1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The model made the following API calls:  
1. `search_for_netflix_v2` with arguments `{""query"": ""The Matrix"", ""limit_titles"": 5}`  
2. `search_for_netflix_v2` with arguments `{""query"": ""The Matrix 1999 movie"", ""limit_titles"": 5}`  
3. `title_details_for_netflix_v2` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80174608""}`  
4. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The Matrix (1999) was directed by the Wachowski siblings, Lana and Lilly Wachowski (formerly known as Larry and Andy Wachowski). While I couldn't retrieve the specific details from the Netflix API, I can confidently state that the Wachowskis were the directors of this groundbreaking science fiction film.""}`  

The required API call was:  
`search_for_netflix_v2` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions"" }`  

The model did not invoke the required API call `search_for_netflix_v2` to specifically search for ""The Matrix Revolutions."" While there were API calls made to search for queries like ""The Matrix"" and ""The Matrix 1999 movie,"" these are not the same as the required query for ""The Matrix Revolutions."" Thus, the invocation does not satisfy Objective 2 requirements.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, the final answer provided by the model violates the dependency of Objective 3 on Objective 2, leading directly to a failure for Objective 3 as per guidelines. Additionally, the model openly stated that it could not retrieve specific details from the Netflix API and provided a final answer unrelated to the API results, which also fails to directly fulfill the user's instruction of finding and verifying the director through Netflix API data."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2: The required API call was `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the argument `{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}`. However, the model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with `{""query"": ""Star Wars"", ""limit_titles"": 5}`  
2. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with `{""query"": ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", ""limit_titles"": 5}`  
3. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with `{""query"": ""George Lucas Star Wars"", ""limit_titles"": 5}`  

None of these queries match the expected query `""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""`. Therefore, the tool calls made by the model did not fulfill the required API specification, resulting in **failure for Objective 2**.  

For Objective 3: The final answer provided is ""The original Star Wars film (Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope) was directed by George Lucas??"" which does provide some relevant knowledge. However, this answer was not based on data retrieved from any API calls because the tool invocation failed to correctly query the expected ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."" Instead, this answer was generated independently of the API results entirely. Since Objective 2 is a failure, and the answer is not derived adequately from the API data, this results in **failure for Objective 3**."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",10,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The actual tool call was:  
`'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"": ""12-01-2022"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2022""}`  

The required tool call was:  
`'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`  

The difference lies in the year of the date range. The model used `""2022""` instead of the required `""2023""` in `date1` and `date2`. Since the arguments do not match, this results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed (by failing to invoke the required API call with the correct arguments), it can be directly concluded that Objective 3 is also a failure. Although a final answer was provided to the user, it was based on an incorrect API response (from `""2022""` data) rather than the required `""2023""` data, making the final answer invalid."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 

- **Objective 2:**  
   - **Actual Tool Call by the Model:**  
     ```  
     'search_countries_timezone_for_geography' with arguments '{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}'
     'search_countries_timezone_for_geography' with arguments '{""timezone"": ""UTC+04:00""}'
     'search_countries_timezone_for_geography' with arguments '{""timezone"": ""UTC+05:00""}'
     ```
     
   - **Expected Tool Call:**  
     ```
     'search_countries_timezone_for_geography' with arguments '{ ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"" }'  
     ```
     
   - **Comparison:**  
     The required tool call (`search_countries_timezone_for_geography`) with arguments `timezone: UTC+03:00` was correctly invoked by the model. Even though the model made additional queries with `UTC+04:00` and `UTC+05:00`, this does not violate Objective 2's criteria, as the expected query was executed successfully. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.

- **Objective 3:**  
   - **Final Answer:**  
     ```  
     ""Countries sharing time zones with Russia include:
     1. UTC+03:00 Time Zone: Some parts of Antarctica (though not a typical country)
     2. UTC+04:00 Time Zone: United Arab Emirates (UAE)
     Please note that Russia spans multiple time zones (from UTC+2 to UTC+12), so this list is not exhaustive. The most common time zone for Russia is UTC+3 (Moscow Time), but different regions of Russia use different time zones. To get a comprehensive list, you might want to check each specific Russian time zone individually.""
     ```
     
   - **Usage of API Data:**  
     The model used the API response correctly to list countries corresponding to `UTC+03:00` and also extended the query to `UTC+04:00` and `UTC+05:00`. Despite irrelevant inclusion of Antarctica under UTC+03:00, UAE under UTC+04:00 is accurate and an acceptable extension.

   - **Conclusion:**  
     The model effectively utilized the tool's API data to craft a coherent response addressing the user's request. Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2 Analysis:**
  - **Actual tool calls made by the model:** 
    - Tool name: `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api`
    - Arguments: `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`
  - **Expected tool calls:**
    - Tool name: `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api`
    - Arguments: `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`
  - The tool name and arguments are exactly as per the expected tool calls, fulfilling the requirement. Therefore, the Objective 2 is a success.

- **Objective 3 Analysis:**
  - The final answer provided by the model states match details (e.g., the thrilling 3-3 draw, Argentina's penalty victory) that were not based on the API data. The API returned an empty response (`{}`); however, the model attempts to provide independently generated information not retrieved or verified through the API call, violating the requirement for Objective 3.
  - Thus, Objective 3 is a failure because the final answer did not derive from the API's response and contradicted the standards of achieved instruction fulfillment based on retrieved data."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: While the model invoked several tools, none of the actual tool calls match the expected required API call. The expected tool `search_for_jsearch` with the argument `'query': 'teaching in London'` was never invoked. Instead, the model called the same tool (`search_for_jsearch`) with different arguments involving ""entry level jobs in London"" with job requirements specified explicitly (such as ""no experience""). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure. Due to the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Furthermore, even subjectively reviewing the response, the model's actions and final attempts were not focused on teaching jobs, failing to meet the user's instructions."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,4,Failure,Failure**,**,"- Expected Tool Call: `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York"" }`.  
- Actual Tool Calls made by the model:  
  1. `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""query"": ""engineering jobs in New York"", ""location"": ""New York, NY""}` (invocation failed due to an unexpected argument `'location'`).  
  2. Attempted retry `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""query"": ""engineering jobs in New York, NY""}`.  

The tool calls made were aimed at searching for general ""engineering jobs"" in New York rather than the specific query of ""mechanical engineer"". Furthermore, spelling differences between the user query (""mechanical"") and the tool arguments (""engineering"") deviate significantly in semantic meaning. Hence, the required desired function was not correctly executed by the model.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** As Objective 2 failed, necessary data was not retrieved correctly for the specified query. Additionally, there is no ability to proceed due to misaligned tool usage, and the final user requirements cannot therefore be met."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. **Tool Name**: `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""query"": ""ronaldo""}`  
2. **Tool Name**: `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 8198}`  
3. **Tool Name**: `players_get_header_info_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 8198}`.  

The required API calls are:  
1. **Tool Name**: `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}`  
2. **Tool Name**: `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 3140}`  

When compared:  
- The first tool call `""search_for_transfermarket""` matches the expected API call, as the query string ""ronaldo"" is semantically equivalent to ""Ronaldo"".  
- However, the second tool call `""players_get_profile_for_transfermarket""` has arguments `{""is_id"": 8198}` which is incorrect, as it does not match the required argument `{""is_id"": 3140}`. Instead, the model used the ID corresponding to Cristiano Ronaldo instead of Ronaldo Luis Naz√°rio de Lima, resulting in divergence from the expected behavior.  

Since the invoked API calls do not fully match the required API calls, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

For Objective 3:  
Due to the failure of Objective 2, where the model failed to correctly execute the required ""players_get_profile_for_transfermarket"" call, the final answer cannot be based on the required data retrieved via the missing/differing API call. Furthermore, the final answer provided by the model provides data belonging to Cristiano Ronaldo, incorrectly fulfilling the user's requirement to gather data of Ronaldo Luis Naz√°rio de Lima based on the expected calls. Thus, Objective 3 is also a **failure**."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2:** The expected tool call is `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`. However, while the model invokes the tool `estimated_salary_for_jsearch`, the arguments differ because the actual call is:  
   
   1. `{""job_title"": ""Entry-level Business Analyst"", ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA""}`
   2. `{""job_title"": ""Entry-level Software Developer"", ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA""}`  
   
   The job titles are not consistent with the required `software developer`, as only one call coincides somewhat (*Entry-level Software Developer*), but the job title is written differently, showing inconsistency. Additionally, the location required is `""New York""`, but the actual calls use `""New York, NY, USA""`?îthese are semantically close but serve different outputs via specific searches or filters.  
   
   In summary, the required tool arguments miss precise matches with the first part of the job concepts in failed difference reconciliation ?Ä mistakes_ABORT_TOO closet!.function ];

10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call requires using `search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search` with the argument `""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""`. However, the model called this same tool with the argument `""query"": ""Star Wars""`, which differs from the expected query. This mismatch makes the tool call incorrect, resulting in a failure for Objective 2. As the failure of Objective 2 implies the failure of Objective 3, the model?ôs response did not align with the specific initial query requirement and the resolution does not meet the initial instruction's intent."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }`. However, the model invoked no such API call and instead prompted the user to provide more input without interacting with the required tool. Additionally, since no valid tool calls were made (Objective 2 failed), the model cannot produce a sufficiently accurate or meaningful final answer based on API responses, leading to a direct failure for Objective 3."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  **`projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`** with arguments: **`{""season"": ""2020""}`**  

- The actual tool calls by the model:  
  1. **`projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`** with arguments **`{""season"": ""2020""}`**  
  2. Additional calls:  
    - **`projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`** with arguments **`{""season"": ""2021""}`**  
    - **`world_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`** with arguments **`{}`**  

The required invocation of **`projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`** for the 2020 season was made correctly with the specified arguments (`""season"": ""2020""`). Additional unnecessary tool calls (e.g., querying for the 2021 season or current world rankings) do not affect the success of Objective 2.  

**Conclusion for Objective 2:** Success  

For Objective 3:  
- The user's instruction was to find projected PGA rankings for the COVID season (interpreted correctly as the 2020 season).  
- The required API call attempted to retrieve this data but returned empty rankings. The model appropriately reasoned that further queries for other seasons might help but similarly returned no data for 2021.
- When no useful data for the requested information (projected rankings) was available, it shifted to provide world golf rankings using the **`world_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`** API call and correctly furnished a detailed answer regarding top-ranking golfers. The final response highlights its reliance on the retrieved data (e.g., rankings and dates).

**Conclusion for Objective 3:** Success"
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with arguments `{""tournament_id"": ""650""}`. The actual tool call made by the model was `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with arguments `{""tournament_id"": 474}`. The argument ""tournament_id"" does not match the expected value. This discrepancy leads to a failure for Objective 2, and as per the guidelines, Objective 3 is also considered a failure. The model's final response also does not fulfill the user's request for the correct leaderboard information from the specified tournament ID, further supporting the failure in achieving Objective 3."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call was 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis' with the arguments:  
```json
{
  ""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"",
  ""n_players"": ""10"",
  ""category"": ""singles""
}
```
The model invoked the tool 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis' with these arguments:  
```json
{
  ""timestamp"": ""current"",
  ""n_players"": ""10"",
  ""category"": ""singles""
}
```
While `n_players` and `category` match, the critical `timestamp` argument does not match. The expected argument specifies ""2025-01-20"", while the model used ""current,"" introducing a failure in this required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

Since Objective 2 failed, we can infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, even upon analyzing further, the final answer provided by the model does not fulfill the user's requirement, as it is based on data using the wrong timestamp. Thus, Objective 3 fails."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The expected tool call was:  
- `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments: `'{ ""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }'`.

The tools actually invoked by the model were:  
- `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments: `'{ ""category"": ""returnpointswon"", ""season"": ""2012"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }'`.  
- `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments: `'{ ""category"": ""returnpointswon1stserve"", ""season"": ""2012"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }'`.  

The argument `'category'` used in the actual tool calls does not match the required `'category': ""return""`. Instead, the model used `'returnpointswon'` and `'returnpointswon1stserve'`, which are semantically different from the expected value. Based on the guidelines that only semantically close matches are acceptable, these differences fail to meet the requirement. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure.

Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final response provided by the model acknowledges the inability to retrieve the statistics due to errors. Therefore, the user's instruction was not fulfilled, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2 Reasoning**:  
    - Tool invoked by the model: `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"": ""CNY"", ""to"": ""GBP"", ""int"": ""1""}`.  
    - Required tool call: `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`.  
    - The tool `exchange_for_currency_v2` was correctly invoked by the model according to the required API call. The model substituted `""base"": ""RMB""` with `""base"": ""CNY""`, which is acceptable since ""RMB"" and ""CNY"" share the same semantic meaning representing Chinese Yuan. Additional irrelevant parameters, such as `""int"": ""1""`, do not affect the correctness. Hence, the tool invocation is correct.  

- **Objective 3 Reasoning**:  
    - The user asked for the exchange rate between CNY and GBP.  
    - The model correctly retrieved the exchange rate (`1 CNY = 0.11 GBP`) using the tool `exchange_for_currency_v2` and provided a complete explanation for converting 100 CNY to GBP, along with advice about exchange rate fluctuations.  
    - The final answer was generated based on the tool response data and fulfilled the user's requirements accurately. Thus, Objective 3 is successful."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- To evaluate Objective 2, the expected tool call is `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `'{\n  ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""\n   }'`. However, the tool call made by the model was `'Finish'` with arguments for generating a final answer apologizing for requiring the exact TikTok username. The expected tool `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` was not invoked; hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- For Objective 3, as Objective 2 has already failed, we can directly infer that the model did not fulfill the user's request to retrieve profile information for ""Jack"" and relied solely on the justification provided about needing an exact username. Therefore, Objective 3 also failed."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected API calls were the following:  
1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{ ""symbol"": ""TSLA"" }`.  
2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{ ""symbol"": ""TSLA"" }`.  
3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{ ""symbol"": ""TSLA"" }`.  

Upon reviewing the actual invoked tools:  
1. The model called `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}` (matches the requirement).  
2. The model called `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}` (matches the requirement).  
3. The model called `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}` (matches the requirement).  

All required tool calls were correctly made as per the expectations, including the correct function names and arguments. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer was delivered by invoking:  
`Finish` with arguments containing:  
```  
""Detailed TSLA Stock Analysis:  
... (Index trend, balance sheet, institutional ownership summary)
```

The final answer accurately synthesized insights from the tool responses into a comprehensive analysis of TSLA-related data, including Index Trends, the Balance Sheet overview, and Institutional Ownership highlights.  
The response aligns with and fulfills the user's instruction (to gather detailed information about ""TSLA""). 

Thus, the model effectively used the tool results to construct the final, detailed user-focused analysis. Objective 3 is also a success."

2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
Additionally, the model also invoked:  
- `'stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}` (this was not required and is unnecessary for the task).  

The required API calls were as specified:  
1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  

The model invoked all the required tools with correct arguments. It also invoked an additional unnecessary call, which does not violate the evaluation rules as the excess tool is irrelevant for compliance. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.

**Objective 3:**  
While the model invoked the expected APIs and received responses from them, it failed to provide any final answer to fulfill the user's instruction. The process ended without a ""give_answer"" directive being executed or a final answer being presented based explicitly on the API-collected data. The absence of a final answer means **Objective 3 fails**."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required tool call is:  
  `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}`.  
- The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
  `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}`.  
- The tool name matches exactly, and the input arguments are also accurate. While a few additional APIs were called (such as `stock_recommendation_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` and a `Finish` module), these are unnecessary but do not impact correctness for Objective 2. Thus, there is alignment between required and actual tool invocation.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model invoked the required tool to acquire the ""index trend history"" for NVIDIA (NVDA) and retrieved accurate responses based on API data.  
- The final answer was derived directly from the API responses. For instance, information provided on P/E ratio, PEG ratio, and growth trends aligns exactly with data in the retrieved tool response for `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`. The recommendation trends were additional but complement and do not contradict the instructions.  
- Since the user's instruction is fully addressed with proper attribution to API responses and final structured information, Objective 3 is satisfied."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API call is `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `""symbol"": ""DJR""`. However, the actual API call invoked by the model was `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `""symbol"": ""DIA""`. The symbol provided in the tool call does not match the expected symbol (""DJR""), and spelling or argument mismatch is not permissible as per stipulated rules. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 directly failed, we infer failure of Objective 3 as well. Without the correct use of tool APIs as expected, the user's instruction cannot possibly be fulfilled accurately. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer in `give_answer`, further reaffirming failure for Objective 3."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is:

```
The invoked tool calls include:
```
{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"": ""META""}'}

The tool name matches perfectly, and the argument `""symbol"": ""META""` aligns with the required value (no deviations in spelling or semantics). Thus the tool call meets the expectation. Additionally, the model invoked other tools (`stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2` and `Finish`), but these additional tool calls do not affect the evaluation, as per the guidance. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model processed data from the tool `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` and used this to return growth estimates for different quarters and years accurately. Further, it provided an overview of the company's industry and sector in its final response using data from `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2`. The final answer effectively fulfilled the user's request and was based on the information retrieved from the tools. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."

Since all required tool calls were executed as expected, Objective 2 is successfully achieved.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final output provided by the assistant effectively achieves the user's instruction to give details about the streamer Shadoune Kane. The final answer compiles the necessary data fetched using the invoked API tools:  
1. From `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api`, information about the Twitch user ID (`36533048`) and login (`shadoune666`) as well as the fact that the streamer was not currently streaming was retrieved.  
2. The channel goal details (type, current contributions, target contributions, created date, and status) were correctly fetched and incorporated from the `get_channel_goals_for_twitch_api`.  
3. All elements in the final answer derive directly from gathered API data, fulfilling the user's query accurately.  

Thus, the model successfully used the tools to compile the final response."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was to use the `video_details_for_tiktok_api` tool with the argument `""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""`. However, the actual tool call made by the model for this tool does not include the required argument `""video_id""`. Instead, the model attempted to call the tool with empty arguments `{}`, which resulted in an error. This discrepancy causes Objective 2 to fail. As Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails since the user's instruction could not be successfully fulfilled, and the necessary API response required for the evaluation of engagement was not retrieved."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**: The required API call is:  
```  
'name': 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes', 'arguments': '{ ""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4hour"", ""from"": ""2024-01-01"", ""to"": ""2024-12-30"" }'

The actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:
1.  
```  
'name': 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes', 'arguments': '{""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4h""}'
```  
2.  
```  
'name': 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes', 'arguments': '{""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4hour""}'

None of the tool calls includes the required `from` and `to` date parameters `""from"": ""2024-01-01""` and `""to"": ""2024-12-30""`, which are explicitly expected in the API requirements. Thus, none of the tool calls meet the expected specification, even though the other parameters like `symbol` and `interval` match. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a failure.**  

**Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the model's response could not completely achieve the user's instruction. While the model did retrieve real-time stock data and shared general insights, it did not provide the requested historical stock data for the specified date range and consistent interval `""4hour""`. Furthermore, the model explicitly mentioned in the final output that it couldn't retrieve the required historical data into the response (""I encountered an issue retrieving the exact historical data for the specified date range...""), confirming that the user's request was not fully fulfilled.

Thus, **Objective 3 is also a failure.**"
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,2,Failure,Success**,Success**,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, we evaluated whether the tool call(s) invoked by the model match the expected API calls.  

- **Tool invoked by the model**:  
  - **Name**: `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
  - **Arguments**: `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""sort"": ""asc"", ""accept"": ""application/json""}`  

- **Required tool**:  
  - **Name**: `ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
  - **Arguments**: `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC""}`  

**Analysis**:  
The tool name matches closely, even though there is a minor difference in the spelling of ""ohclv"" instead of ""ohlcv."" Furthermore, the parameters specified in the required arguments (`market_venue`, `start`, `symbol`, and `base`) are all accurately matched. The invoked tool includes additional parameters, namely, `gran`, `sort`, and `accept`. Since these additional parameters do not detract from the correctness of intention or execution as per the required information, this is acceptable.  
**Outcome**: The tool invocation is deemed accurate.  

For **Objective 3**:  
The final answer produced by the model is a detailed historical price summary for Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) on Binance based on the data obtained in the tool call. The step-by-step logic:  

1. The tool call successfully retrieved OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, vwap, etc.).  
2. This data appears in the final response with correct formatting and details (e.g., dates, numerical values), addressing user queries fully and accurately.  

Since the model's final output constitutes a precise summary generated on the basis of the data fetched through the API call, the user's instruction is achieved effectively.  
**Outcome**: Success in fulfilling the user's instruction and deriving the answer from the tool data."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API calls were:  
1. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments:

However, the model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments:  
    ```
    {
      ""base"": ""USD"",
      ""symbols"": ""XAU"",

    }
    ```
4. `'supported_symbols_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments:  
    `{}`  

These do not match the required API calls, as the date ranges differ drastically, and the model focused more on gold (""XAU"") and never invoked the proper request for ""XPT."" Because the required API calls, especially regarding their temporal scope and parameters, were not followed, **failure for Objective 2** is the result.  

Additionally, for **Objective 3**, there was no final answer provided to fulfill the user's instruction. Since Objective 2 failed, this also implies the model would inherently fail to accurately fulfill the request and give the proper final answer based on correct API-provided data. Hence, **Objective 3 fails** as well."

   - The required API calls focus specifically on the date range from 2024-02-10 to 2024-02-13 for both `XAU` and `XPT`. The actual tool calls provide historical data for different date ranges (e.g., ""2024-01-25 to 2024-02-10"") and do not include the precise required date range. Hence, this is a **failure**.  

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
   - As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is **automatically a failure**. Additionally, the final response from the model did not provide data that aligns with the user's specified date range (February 10, 2024, to February 13, 2024). Instead, the retrieved data ends on February 10, 2024, so the user instruction is not fulfilled."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The required API call is `'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'` with the arguments:
  ```
  {
    ""interval"": ""y1"",
    ""is_id"": ""02823""

  The actual tool call made by the model for `'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'` is:
  ```
  {
    ""is_id"": ""hscei:ind"",
    ""interval"": ""y1""

  ```  
  While the tool name is correct, the argument `is_id` required by the tool does not match (`""is_id"": ""02823""` was expected, but `""is_id"": ""hscei:ind""` was provided). This renders the tool invocation incorrect, and thus, Objective 2 fails.

- For Objective 3:  
  Since Objective 2 failed, it means the expected tool call to achieve the user's instruction was not executed correctly. Therefore, the response derived from the wrong tool call cannot be trusted to fulfill the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The expected API call is:  
`'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}`  

The actual tools invoked by the model include:  
1. `'latest_drawing_for_fantasy_5'` - Unnecessary, not part of the expected tools (this does not affect correctness).  
2. `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date"": ""07-02-2023""}` - Unnecessary intermediate tool call; not part of the expected tools.  
3. `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}` - This matches the required call precisely, fulfilling the requirement of Objective 2. Additional tool invocations not outlined in the expectation are irrelevant as the required tool call has been made accurately.  

Therefore, **Objective 2 is marked as a success**.  

**Objective 3**:  
The ""final_answer"" provided by the model is:  
`""For 01-02-2024, there were two Fantasy 5 drawing sets:\n\nMIDDAY Drawing: 5 15 17 28 30\nEVENING Drawing: 14 15 28 32 33""`  

This final answer is derived directly from the data retrieved via the API call to `drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5` with the correct date argument (`""01-02-2024""`). The provided answer matches the user instruction (yesterday?ôs drawing numbers for the date `01-02-2024`), proving that it fulfills the requirement.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed (the inputs to the tool call didn't align with the user's required date range), the final answer provided by the model is based on incorrect data (date range for May instead of December) and does not fulfill the user instruction. The objective data requirement is not satisfied, making Objective 3 a failure as well."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me.

However, the actual tool called by the model was `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""To calculate the total amount of coins, I need more specific information about the number and value of coins in each pocket.""}`. These tool calls do not match, indicating a failure in Objective 2.

For Objective 3, given that Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure.

While the second call of the actual tool matches the required tool call (`users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`) in terms of both name and arguments, the model also unnecessarily invoked other tooling that was not needed (such as `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` and `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2`). Furthermore, the argument key for the third tool call contains a typo (`""is_id""` instead of `""id""`). These unnecessary, superfluous calls and the argument errors make Objective 2 a failure.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure, as noted in the evaluation rules.

2. `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `'{""q"": ""Waikiki Beach Oahu Hawaii most beautiful beaches"", ""num"": 5}'`.  

The arguments do not align with the required API calls. For the first expected API call, the semantic intent of searching for daily weather forecasts was completely dropped and not addressed in the appropriate tool calls. For the second expected API call related to beach images in Hawaii, while there is some matching intention, the actual query for Waikiki Beach does not match the generic intent for ""images of the beaches at Hawaii island."" Thus, the required API calls were not fulfilled successfully, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 already failed, it directly implies Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, while the provided final answer included some relevant content regarding Oahu, Hawaii, it did not effectively retrieve weather forecasts or provide images as outlined.

   - **Tool Name**: `search_for_g_search` with arguments: `{""q"": ""Top romantic michelin star restaurants in Paris"", ""gl"": ""FR"", ""hl"": ""en"", ""num"": ""7""}`  
   - **Tool Name**: `search_for_g_search` with arguments: `{""q"": ""Best romantic fine dining restaurants in Paris 2024 with best atmosphere"", ""gl"": ""FR"", ""hl"": ""en"", ""num"": ""5""}`.  

Based on this comparison:  
- The actual tool call using `search_for_g_search` contains the queries related to ""romantic restaurants"" or more specific locations, but it does not match the query required in the expected API, which is `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""}`.  
- Additionally, other tool calls (`location_for_g_search`) were invoked but were not listed as required.
  
As the required query was not used (""popular restaurants in Paris""), Objective 2 failed.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure (the necessary API calls for Nigeria's details and states were not made), Objective 3 is directly a failure as well. The model's final answer pertains to Seychelles, which does not fulfill the user's instruction regarding identifying the richest country in Africa the user hasn't been to before (expected focus on Nigeria). The model's final response was preliminary irrelevant to the requirement due to incorrect tool usage."

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the model's final response is not derived from the expected API calls specified in the required API calls. Additionally, the user's instruction to retrieve information on a specific country relating to Europe (expected to be Ukraine here, as indicated by the required call) was not satisfactorily achieved because the model focused on Moldova instead of the specified country **`countryCode`: ""UA""**.

**Reason:**  
The actual tool calls deviate from the required tools due to differences in the ""countryCode"" parameters and geographic focus. Furthermore, the final answer corresponds to Moldova rather than Ukraine, failing to fulfill the user's presumed requirement of resulting data pertaining to Ukraine."

  2. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""SG""}`  
  3. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""SG""}`.

- The model invoked `country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db` for the country code ""SG"" (Singapore). However, the required calls are for country code ""MY"" (Malaysia). Since the arguments passed in the calls differ in values (expected ""MY"", provided ""SG""), Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Given that Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Specifically, the user's instruction was to find information related to Malaysia (""MY""), but the model instead retrieved details for Singapore (""SG""). As a result, the final answer does not fulfill the user's request regarding Malaysia."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:
1. The required API calls are:
   - `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`
   - `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`
   
2. The actual tool calls made by the model:
   - `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""IN""}`
   - `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""IN""}`

Even though the argument key has a slight difference in capitalization (`countrycode` vs. `countryCode`), this does not affect the semantic equivalence of the tool calls. The mandatory tool names and argument meanings were correctly matched. Since there is accurate tool invocation and required tools were executed, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:
- The final response consolidates information from `country_details_for_referential_db` (providing country details such as capital, region, currency, and coordinates) and `states_for_referential_db` (providing state names and their respective coordinates).
- The compilation of data output by the tools (the retrieved details of the country and its states) is present in the provided final answer. This indicates that the model utilized the API data effectively to fulfill the user's instructions.
- Consequently, Objective 3 is also a success."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the actual tool call invoked by the model is `Finish` with `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""...[request for more information]...""}`. However, the required API call is `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with `{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}`. The required tool was not called, and therefore the model did not meet the criteria for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also failed as per the guidelines. The final answer provided by the model is a request for clarification or additional information rather than fulfilling the user's request for finding intimate dining options for the parents' anniversary dinner. This final response does not align with or fulfill the user's instruction."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The model is required to call the following API endpoints:  
1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments: `'{ ""q"": ""After Everything"" }'`.  
2. `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with arguments: `'{ ""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything"" }'`.  

However, the actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments: `'{ ""q"": ""After Ever Happy""}'`.   
   - **Mismatch in Argument**: Here, the argument `""q""` should have been `""After Everything""`, but the model specified `""After Ever Happy""`. Though semantically related to the film series, this is a distinct entry and does not align directly with the expected term ""After Everything,"" leading to a mismatch.  
   
2. `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with arguments: `'{ ""is_id"": ""78487-after-ever-happy""}'`.
   - **Mismatch in Argument**: The argument `""is_id""` should have been `""84915-after-everything""`, but the model provided `""78487-after-ever-happy""`. This mismatch directly stems from the incorrect results derived based on the prior erroneous tool call.  

Since neither of the tool calls fulfilled the argument expectations precisely, Objective 2 is concluded as a **Failure**.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 has failed (due to incorrect API calls), the derived results from the tool responses were not based on the expected data, and consequently, the final response cannot fulfill the intended user's instruction. This leads to a **Failure** for Objective 3 as well. Additionally:  
- The final response claimed to provide movies similar to '""After Ever Happy""' instead of '""After Everything""' as per the user's instructions. This is not aligned with the user's request."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The model invoked the tool ""get_id_for_similar_movies"" with the correct argument `""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""`, as required in the expected API call. The actual invoked tool call aligns with the required API call.  

- Expected API Call:  
  `{name: 'get_id_for_similar_movies', ""arguments"": '{
    ""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""
   }'}`  

- Actual Tool Call by the model:  
  `get_id_for_similar_movies` with `{ ""arguments"": ""{ 'q': 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom' }"" }`.  

Since they match, Objective 2 is met.

For Objective 3: The model used the response from the tool calls effectively. It matched the ID (`58131-aquaman`) found for the first ""Aquaman (2018)"" movie from the initially retrieved list, correctly used that ID to find movies similar to Aquaman and later generated the recommendations effectively based on API-retrieved data from the second tool call. The final answer aligns with the user's instruction of finding similar movies to Jason Momoa's recent film and uses API data as context.  

The final answer provided to the user mentions recommendations like ""Aquaman (2018)"" and ""Justice League (2017)"" with clear connections to the genres, themes, and storytelling elements derived from related API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is also fulfilled."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is to `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{ ""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27"" }`. However, the model did not invoke this API or make any relevant tool call to fetch the desired data. Instead, the model made a function call to `Finish` with arguments providing a final answer that requests more clarification regarding the user's birthday. The required API call was never initiated, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly fails. Additionally, the model provided a final answer asking for the birthday details of the user rather than fulfilling the original instruction to find actors and actresses born on a given birthday. Thus, the user's instruction was not completed successfully."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
   1. The tool invoked by the model was `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments: 
      ```json
      {
          ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
          ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
          ""base"": ""USDT"",
          ""start"": ""2023-05-01T00:00:00"",
          ""end"": ""2023-05-31T23:59:59"",
          ""gran"": ""1d"",
          ""accept"": ""application/json""
      }
      ```  
   2. The required API call was `OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments: 
      ```json
      {
          ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
          ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
          ""base"": ""USDT"",
          ""symbol"": ""BTC""
      }
      ```  
   3. The invoked tool name (`ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`) is semantically similar but does not exactly match the required tool name (`OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`, though it could be interpreted as acceptable based on tolerance towards similar naming issues). However, the arguments for the tool invocation are significantly different. Specifically:  
      - The `start` date argument mismatches: ""2023-05-01T00:00:00"" in the invoked tool versus ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"" in the required API call.  
      - The `end` date and granularity (`gran`) parameters were not specified in the required API call but were added unnecessarily in the invoked tool's call.  
   This mismatch in critical data elements (especially start time) makes it a failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  Since Objective 2 failed due to significant mismatches in tool parameters, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Even though the model provided a final answer, that answer cannot be considered valid because it was not based on the required API call's data. Additionally, the given `final_answer` introduces fabricated data and uses selected range and volumetric statistics not aligned with what the required API call would retrieve. Hence, the task was not effectively fulfilled following the user's instruction."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,4,Failure,Failure**,** The required API calls and the actual tool calls invoked by the model are mismatched. Here is the comparison,"1. **Actual Tool Call (1st Derivative):**
   - Tool Name: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`
   - Arguments: `""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""`
   - ??This matches the first required tool call exactly.
   
2. **Actual Tool Call (2nd Derivative):**
   - Tool Name: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`
   - Arguments: `""expression"": ""8*x^3 + 15*x^4"", ""variable"": ""x""`
   - ??This does not match the required tool call. The required expression should be `""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""`. Note that the model has an incorrect order for terms (it uses ""8*x^3 + 15*x^4"" instead of ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"").

3. **Actual Tool Call (3rd Derivative):**
   - Tool Name: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`
   - Arguments: `""expression"": ""24*x^2 + 60*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""`
   - ??This does not match the required tool call. The required expression should be `""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2 "", ""variable"": ""x""`. Again, the terms' order is incorrect according to the required API call.

Additionally, the model makes an extra, unnecessary API tool call:
- Tool Call for `validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`: `""arguments"": {""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1""}`. This is not part of the required API calls.

As the second and third API calls fail to meet the expectations, Objective 2 is a failure.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, we must also conclude that Objective 3 fails as well, by rule. The inaccuracies in obtaining data?îor incorrectly constructing terms?îmeans the final answer cannot fulfill the user's instruction which required derivation using the correct API expression data for consistency."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  **Model's Tool Invocations**:  
  - `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`
  - `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`  

  **Expected Tool Calls**:  
  - `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`
  - `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`  

  The tool names (both slightly case-insensitive versions of 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' match perfectly, accommodating technical variations as acceptable). Moreover, all the required arguments (the `expression` and `variable` values) match exactly between the model?ôs tool calls and the expected API calls.  
  Since both required tool calls were executed correctly, this qualifies as a *success* for Objective 2.
  
- For Objective 3:  
  - The user expected to calculate the first-order derivatives of two mathematical expressions:
    1. `3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1` with respect to `a` ??the derivative is calculated correctly as `15*a^4 + 8*a^3`  
    2. `5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3` with respect to `b` ??the derivative is calculated correctly as `15*b^2 + 8*b`  

  - The model invoked appropriate tools, correctly parsed their responses (derivative results) from the API responses, and provided a final answer directly derived from these tool calls. Since the explanation included rule-based reasoning (demonstrating the power rule), it strengthens the notion that the output is accurate and fulfills the user's instruction.  

  Hence, Objective 3 was also *successfully achieved*."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:
1. For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:
   - `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `'{ ""city"": ""London"" }'`.

   However, the corresponding actual tool call made by the model did not include the required `""city"": ""London""` argument in the API call. Instead, the call lacked adequate parameters related to the city or zip code entirely:  
   - Actual tool invoked: `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with **arguments `{}`**.  
   Because the required `""city"": ""London""` argument was absent, it is considered **incorrect** for Objective 2.

2. For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2 has failed**, we can directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed. Furthermore, the final response from the assistant cited ""technical limitations"" and was not able to derive a meaningful weather forecast for England using any retrieved data. This failure further confirms that the model was unable to fulfill the user's instruction effectively."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call was as follows:
   - `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{""username"": ""KingJames""}`
   However, the tool invoked by the model was `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""I need the specific Twitter username to retrieve James's information. Please provide the exact Twitter handle.""}`. There is no invocation of the expected tool `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'`, so it is a failure for Objective 2.  

- For **Objective 3**, since the model failed Objective 2 (it did not make the required API call), we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not fulfil the user request but ended its interaction by stating it needed the Twitter handle, so the user instruction is not fulfilled."
