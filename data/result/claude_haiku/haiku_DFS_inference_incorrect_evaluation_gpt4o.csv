1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model made the following API calls:  
  1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}`.  
  2. `'packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999"", ""carriercode"": ""fastway-au"", ""lang"": ""en""}`.  
  3. `'packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999"", ""carriercode"": ""fastway-ie"", ""lang"": ""en""}`.  
The required API calls were:  
  1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`.  
  2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`.  
There is a mismatch between the tracking number in the actual and required API calls. The actual API calls use ""YT9999999999"" instead of the required ""YT2003521266065328."" Furthermore, the actual and required tool names for the package tracking request also differ. The required tool name is `""packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2""`, while the model invoked the depreciated logic `""packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2""`. Hence, the model fails Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: Due to the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 also fails because the model used invalid tool calls (wrong tracking numbers and incorrect API calls). Consequently, the final response (""two potential carriers detected but no tracking information retrieved"") is based on problematic results from incorrect API calls and does not fulfill the user's request adequately."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- **Actual Tool Calls Made by the Model:**
  - `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}`
  - `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}`
- **Required API Calls:**
  - `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`
  - `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`

The model invoked the correct tool names but provided the wrong tracking number argument (`""NY9999999990""` instead of `""YT2003521266065328""` for both tools). Since the arguments do not match, Objective 2 cannot be deemed successful.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, it implies the API data retrieved is irrelevant to the required tracking number. Therefore, the final response cannot be based on correct API call data, leading to a failure in Objective 3 even though an answer was provided. The provided tracking information and carrier detection details do not apply to the required tracking number."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,60,5,Success,Success,Success,"The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
2. `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
2. `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

While the capitalization of the tool names (`get_ios_app_for_ios_store` vs. `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` and `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` vs. `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store`) differs slightly, this is considered a non-semantic mismatch and does not affect the correctness of the calls. The arguments match exactly. Therefore, all required API calls were properly executed, fulfilling Objective 2.

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The final ""give_answer"" call derives directly from the outcomes of the API calls, namely:  
1. The details of the app `Clash Royale` (ID `1053012308`) successfully retrieved using `get_ios_app_for_ios_store`.  
2. The similar apps retrieved (including `""Castle Crush""`) using `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store`.  

The model also responded correctly by acknowledging the initial invalid app ID (`1053012309`) and shifted to the corrected app ID (`1053012308`). Its considerations and clarifications given to the user align with the data retrieved from API responses, validating its methodology to fulfill the user instructions accurately."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The following tools were invoked by the model:  
1. `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}'`.  

The required API call was:  
1. `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `'{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}'`.  

The tool names and arguments match the requirement. The model correctly formed and executed the expected API call.  

For Objective 3: The model's final answer is:  
""Here are the Fantasy 5 winning number sets between January 1st and January 10th, 2023:  

1. 01-10-2023 (Evening): 3, 6, 17, 20, 30  
2. 01-09-2023 (Evening): 13, 21, 23, 24, 36  
3. 01-08-2023 (Evening): 6, 10, 12, 16, 28  
4. 01-07-2023 (Evening): 7, 8, 13, 24, 34  
5. 01-06-2023 (Evening): 3, 15, 16, 17, 34  

These are the actual winning number sets for the Fantasy 5 lottery during the specified period. Good luck with your lottery play!""  

This final answer correctly fulfills the user's request by providing the winning number sets between January 1st and January 10th, 2023. The data for the answer originates from the results retrieved via the API calls. The model appropriately processed the API results into a coherent and clear response, achieving the user?ôs instruction completely."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",29,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call was:  
  `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with arguments:  
  `'{ ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae"" }'`.

  The model invoked `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor`, but **did not include the required argument** `""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""`. Instead, the model invoked the tool without providing the required key or arguments. It didn't match the expected call; hence Objective 2 failed. Further, other tools invoked by the model either do not align with the required tools or were unnecessary calls like repeating unrelated data retrievals.

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure (per rule, Objective 3 fails if Objective 2 is a failure), the final response is derived independently of the API interaction with the required parameters. Additionally, the final answer remains generic without specifically addressing key information that should have resulted from effective use of the required API call. The recommendations provided are overly general and speculative without being adequately influenced by retrieving the intended specifics. Although the final answer includes observations, these are irrelevant since the assistive API calls and their outputs are misaligned with the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 also fails to fulfill user requirements."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **For Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
   The expected API calls include:  
     1. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`, and  
     2. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`.  

   The actual tool calls by the model are:  
     1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`.  
     2. `Finish` function with arguments for returning the final answer.  

   The tool `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` is correctly invoked with the expected arguments. However, the required tool `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` is missing entirely, and the final call to `Finish` is unnecessary from the original requirements. Since not all expected tools have been invoked (specifically `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` is missing), Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **For Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
   The model provides a final answer that is presented to the user. However, because the required API call `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` was not invoked, the final answer provided is incomplete, as it lacks data that could have been obtained through this API. Additionally, the response depends only on partial tool data and is unrelated to the inference from the omitted expected API. Therefore, the model fails to fulfill the user's instructions comprehensively. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as well."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**: The model did not invoke the required API calls to complete the user's instruction. The required API calls were:  
  1. `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
  2. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

  However, the model only invoked one tool:  
  - `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

  These invoked tools did not include any of the required tools or their corresponding arguments for performing IP analysis. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.

- **Objective 3**: The model did not achieve the user's instruction, as it concluded the interaction without providing any analysis of the IP address or invoking the necessary tools to do so. Instead, the model refused to proceed further due to an invalid IP address (`288.288.288.288`); then it used a `Finish` tool and gave up completely. No derived final answer based on API calls was provided. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically also fails."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
1. **Objective 2**: The required API calls are as follows:  
   - `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
   - `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
   - `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  

   The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
   - `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2"", ""limit"": ""100"", ""offset"": ""0""}`  
   - `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`  
   - `'artist_featuring_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`  

   The following mismatches exist between the required and actual tool calls:  
   - The `'is_id'` in all actual tool calls does not match the required `'is_id'`. The required `'is_id'` is `""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`, whereas the actual tool calls use `""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""`, which makes them incorrect.  
   - Additionally, the model invoked `'artist_featuring_for_spotify_data'`, which is unnecessary as it doesn't align with the required API calls. However, such extraneous calls are allowed under the guidelines provided.  

   Overall, the expected API calls and their arguments were not satisfied. Hence, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

2. **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 was a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a **failure**. Moreover, the model was unable to retrieve any relevant data due to persistent server errors, and the final answer, while addressing hurdles and suggesting verification steps, does not provide the required information about the artist's albums, overview, or appearances. The final output was not based on retrieved API data, as effective retrieval did not occur."

I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",21,3,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  

_For Objective 2:_  
The required API calls were:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  

The model invoked the following relevant and expected tool calls:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}` (matches the expected call and arguments).  
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}` (matches the expected call and arguments).

10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:**  
The actual tool calls made by the model were as follows:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`.  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`.  

The required calls were:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`.  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`.  

Both actual and required tool calls match perfectly, and no significant deviations, spelling issues, or omissions were observed. Additional arguments, if any, do not impact intent. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The final answer provided by the model references the retrieved data from the API calls. Comprehensive information after processing the `youtube_channel_id` (retrieved as `""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""`) and channel details (e.g., available avatars and banners) were included in the answer, which addresses the user's request to analyze the ""mrbeast"" YouTube channel. Crucially, the retrieval of channel details (profile pictures, banner information, etc.) was explicitly resource-backed by API invocation, and the answer concludes with proper summarization and context.

Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the following tools were invoked by the model:  
- **Tool name:** `validate_email_for_validate_email` with **Arguments:** `{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}`  

The required API call is:  
- **Required Tool name:** `validate_email_for_validate_email` with **Arguments:** `{\n  ""email"": ""test@gmail.com""\n }`  

The tool name and the required argument (""email"") match perfectly between the actual tool call and the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer that appropriately utilized the API response and fulfilled the instruction's requirement. The final answer is:  
""The email address test@gmail.com is valid and verified. It passes all email validation checks:\n??Syntactically correct\n??Valid domain (gmail.com)\n??No regex or typo issues\n??Not a disposable email\n??Valid MX records\n??SMTP validation successful""

The details in the final answer align perfectly with the data retrieved from the API, confirming that the model used the tool response to craft its solution. Since the user's instruction is achieved adequately, Objective 3 is a success."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  - Expected API call:  
    ```  
    {'name': 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""19870630""\n }'}  
    ```  
  - Actual tool calls made by the model:  
    - `'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator'` with arguments `'{}'`
    - `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with arguments `{""date"": ""19870630""}`  
    - `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ...}`  
    
  - The model correctly invoked the required API call `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with the correct argument (`{""date"": ""19870630""}`). The additional calls to `'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator'` and `'Finish'` are not part of the required API calls but do not affect the correctness with regard to the required API call. Hence, Objective 2 passes.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  - The final answer was:  
    ```  
    ""Based on the date of birth 19870630 (June 30, 1987):  

    Age Details:  
    - Current Age: 37 years old  
    - Timezone Used: US/Eastern (default)  

    Regarding your request for age in months and days, I'll calculate that manually:  
    - Years: 37  
    - Months: 37 * 12 = 444 months  
    - Days: As of today, approximately 444 * 30 = 13,320 days (approximate, as months vary in length)  

    Note: The exact day count would depend on the precise current date and accounting for leap years. The age calculator confirms you were born on June 30, 1987, in the US/Eastern timezone.""  
    ```
    - This answer effectively fulfills the user's primary instruction (age calculation) using the data retrieved from the `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` tool. It also provides additional explanations and manipulations to cover the requested details about age in months and days. No information within the final answer is independently fabricated or contradicts the API data, and the details align with the retrieved API response. Therefore, Objective 3 also succeeds."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,75,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"The model was required to make three API calls:  
1. `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with the argument `{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}`

14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,83,7,Success,Success,Failure,"The actual tool calls made by the model were as follows:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""50""}'`  
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  

The required API calls were:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'`  

Both the tool calls made by the model fulfill the requirements.  
- In the case of the `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` API, the actual call contains an additional parameter `""maxresults"": ""50""`, which doesn't affect the intention of the required API call.  
- For the `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` API, both the tool name and arguments exactly match the required API call.  

Thus, all the required API calls were made correctly, allowing for the success.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
The user's instruction was to create an animated movie playlist for a family movie night. However:  
- The model expressed difficulty in properly retrieving a suitable playlist or videos and noted that the playlist provided or searched contained an incorrect ID or inappropriate content for the intended purpose.  
- After multiple attempts, the model invoked new tool searches and iterations but did not achieve the objective of creating a family-friendly animated movie playlist and communicate a comprehensive final answer related to the animation-specific requirement.  
- In the end, the model ""gave up and restarted,"" explicitly stating it was unable to fulfill the task and instead suggested alternative approaches.  

As the final response to the user fails to achieve their instruction, Objective 3 is a failure."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls:  
  1. Tool name: `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments: `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  
  2. Tool name: `user_s_likes_for_twitter` with arguments: `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  
- Actual tool calls made by the model:  
  1. Tool name: `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments: `{""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 10}`  

The tool call to `user_s_followers_for_twitter` made by the model attempted to fetch data but used an incorrect `user_id` (""987654321"" instead of ""96479162""). Moreover, the model only invoked one of the two required API calls (`user_s_likes_for_twitter` was not invoked). Hence, the model failed to execute the required API calls properly.  

For Objective 3:  
As Objective 2 failed, logical dependence implies Objective 3 must also fail. Additionally, the model's final answer explained that it could not achieve the user's instruction due to not having correct or sufficient information. Therefore, the user's instruction was not achieved, and the final answer was not derived from successful API calls."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,18,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required tool call was:  
- `user_details_for_twitter` with arguments: `{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model were as follows:  
1. `search_for_twitter` with arguments: multiple variations containing `query`, `min_retweets`, and `limit`.  
2. `hashtag_for_twitter` with arguments: containing `hashtag` and `limit`.  
3. `Finish` with arguments for status updates and responses.  

The **required tool call (`user_details_for_twitter`)** was not part of the actual tool calls made by the model, resulting in a failure for **Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**, as **Objective 2** is a failure, Objective 3 can directly be inferred as a failure. Additionally, while the model attempted different strategies (such as lowering thresholds, adjusting search queries) and provided a final answer, that answer only acknowledged limitations and gave general recommendations.

Furthermore, the essential insights needed to fulfill the user?ôs request and accurately answer are absent due to the missing tool call. Hence, the model failed to achieve Objective 3."

1. For Objective 2:  
   a. The actual tool invoked by the model is `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with arguments `'{ ""search"": ""wikimania.org""}'`.  
   b. The expected tool call is `'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'` with arguments `'{ ""search"": ""google.com""}'`.  
   c. The tool name is correct, but the argument value for ""search"" differs. The model's argument is for ""wikimania.org,"" whereas the required argument is for ""google.com."" Therefore, the actual call does not meet the expected tool call.  

2. For Objective 3:  
   - Objective 2 is a failure, and as per the instruction, we directly infer Objective 3 as a failure as well. The final answer provided by the model is irrelevant because the required API call was not correctly executed."

1. **Objective 2:**  
   - **Expected API Call:**  
     ```
     'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{
       ""date"": ""2024-06-01""
     }'
     ```
   - **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model:**  
     - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{""date"": ""2025-06-01""}'`
     - `'index_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{}'`
     - `'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""Unfortunately, I cannot retrieve Fear and Greed index data for future dates (June 1st and 15th, 2025). (...)""}'`

   - **Rationale:**  
     The model did not correctly fetch data using the required API call for the date ""2024-06-01."" Instead, it mistakenly called the `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` API with ""date"": ""2025-06-01,"" a future date. The required historical data retrieval for ""2024-06-01"" was never invoked, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

2. **Objective 3:**  
   - The model did not retrieve or utilize the required data for the expected date ""2024-06-01."" Instead, it attempted to fetch future data for ""2025-06-01,"" which resulted in an error, and finally provided current Fear and Greed data retrieved using a different tool `index_for_fear_and_greed_index`. Further, although the model responded with an explanation, it failed to fulfill the user's request for data for the required historical date ""2024-06-01."" This makes the final answer ineffective and the user's instruction unfulfilled.  
  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required tool call is:  
  `{'name': 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', 'arguments': '{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }'}`  
- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `{'type': 'function', 'function': {'arguments': '{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""I\'m sorry, but the dates you requested (February 30th and February 31st) are not valid dates.

For example, you could request scores for February 15th or February 28th of a specific year.""}', 'name': 'Finish'}}`  

The model did not call the expected tool (`historical_for_fear_and_greed_index`) to retrieve data for any valid or correctly inferred date. Instead, it skipped attempting the required calls to collect actual data and provided only a final response using the `Finish` function. As the expected tool was not invoked, this results in a failure for **Objective 2**.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed due to the lack of retrieving data from the correct tool, Objective 3 automatically fails. Moreover, the model identified issues with the user's request (invalid February dates) but did not use tools to proceed with a valid alternative or fulfill the main task (retrieving a Fear and Greed index for a valid date). Therefore, the user's instruction of directly obtaining scores is not satisfied."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Required API call:**  
  Name: 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'  
  Arguments: `{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }`  

- **Actual tool calls made by the model:**  
  Name: 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'  
  Arguments: `{ ""date"": ""2025-02-30"" }`   

The actual tool call made by the model does not match the required API call. Specifically, the required date is ""2024-02-18,"" whereas the model used an invalid date ""2025-02-30."" As such, this mismatch constitutes a **failure** for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred to be a failure as well. Additionally, looking at the final answer provided by the model, it fails to retrieve any relevant information based on the user's requirements as it used invalid and incorrect inputs. The failure carries through to Objective 3, both from faulty tool usage and unmet user instructions."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since the model failed Objective 2, it implies Objective 3 also fails. Specifically, the invalid API call resulted in the queried data not being accurate or aligned with the user's actual requirement (data for `2024-02-18`). Although the model invoked a ""Finish"" tool to articulate a response (indicating an invalid calendar date for 2025), it veered from the user's exact intent and failed to retrieve the requested Fear and Greed index for the specified required date. Moreover, the final answer only addressed user-provided invalid dates instead of fulfilling the requested date/data (i.e., 2024-02-18), causing failure in providing the correct instruction-aligned output."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472?

2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with `{""is_id"": ""90068472""}`
2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with `{""ids"": ""90068472""}`  

The differences are in the arguments. The required title ID (`80057281`) does not match the title ID passed by the model (`90068472`). Since this mismatch violates the requirement for correctness in tool arguments, Objective 2 is deemed a failure.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer this failure carries over to Objective 3, as the final answer could not be verified to be based on the correct data retrieved through the expected API calls.  

**Reason:**  
Objective 2 fails because the tool arguments do not match the expected tool calls (mismatched title ID). Objective 3 fails because the correctness of the final response relies on data retrieved via those tool calls, and Objective 2 has already failed."

2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`   

The actual tool calls made by the model include multiple calls to similar tools (such as `title_similars_for_netflix_data` and `title_details_for_netflix_data`) with arguments `{""is_id"": ""90068472""}` and `{""ids"": ""90068472""}` instead. The argument `is_id` and `ids` are incorrect because ""90068472"" was used instead of ""80057281"". This discrepancy violates Objective 2, making it a failure.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Objective 2 failed, directly leading to a failure for Objective 3. The model did not retrieve the correct information due to the incorrect API arguments, and hence it couldn't achieve the user's instruction of finding similar movies for the given title ID. Even though attempts were made using alternative approaches, the final response was based on placeholder judgments and suggestions rather than valid API tool responses derived from the user's intended input."
24,"My company is launching a new website.

2. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`.  

However, it only invoked `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}`, which does not match the required argument of `""website"": ""getecz.com""`. Furthermore, the second expected tool call, `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`, was not made. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure (tools invoked did not match the expected API calls), Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Although the model provided a final structured answer that addressed the domain ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net,"" it diverged from the given instruction, which required analysis for the domain ""getecz.com."" Thus, the user's original instruction was not fulfilled, and the necessity of using the correct API call responses was not achieved."

2. `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`  

The arguments do not match because the required queries expect the website to be `getecz.com`, but the model invoked the tools using the website `ourbusinessplatform1234567.net`. Therefore, the tool calls do not meet the required API specifications.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails because the final result is based on invalid or mismatched API calls. Additionally, while the final answer summarizes results, it is derived from data fetched using incorrect API calls, and thus, it cannot be considered valid. The user's instruction to analyze speed data and SEO metadata for ""getecz.com"" is not achieved."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

### Objective 2:  
**Tools invoked by the model:**  
1. `'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with `{""expression"": ""What is going on2""}`
2. `'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1""}`
3. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`
4. `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The derivative of 2*x^2 + 3*x + 1 with respect to x is 4x + 3.""}`  

**Expected API calls:**  
1. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with `{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  

**Comparison:**  
The model's invocation of `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` aligns correctly with the required API call, with both the tool name and the arguments matching exactly:  
`""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""`.  

While the model invoked additional tools (`'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` and `'Finish'`), these were not described in the ""required API calls."" However, per the rule, the invocation of additional tools that do not interfere with the task's validity is allowed, so Objective 2 is considered successful.  

---

### Objective 3:  
**Final Answer:**  
The model provided the final answer: `""The derivative of 2*x^2 + 3*x + 1 with respect to x is 4x + 3.""`.  

The final answer aligns with the results obtained from querying the API (`'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` produced `""response"": ""3 + 4*x""`). The reasoning steps were also derived using tools, ensuring the response was grounded in API data. Furthermore, the final answer achieved the user's instruction of differentiating a mathematical expression with respect to a variable.  

Therefore, **Objective 3 is a success.**"
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:** The required API calls include:  
1. `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""leomessi"" }`  
2. `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""leomessi"" }`  

The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments `{""username"": ""leomesssi""}` and `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`.  
2. `'finish'` tool with details based on retrieved data.

The required call to `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with the correct username `""leomessi""` **matches** one of the retrieved calls; however, *the required call to `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` was never made by the model*. This omission fails Objective 2 because both expected API calls need to be executed to succeed.

**Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. Additionally, there is no evidence that the storytelling function (`'get_story_for_instagram_profile'`) was utilized in the final answer. Therefore, the user's instruction to retrieve both profile information and stories (via indirect implication) for the Instagram account cannot be fully satisfied."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2** was successfully achieved.  
- The expected tool call was:  
```json
{'name': 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', 'arguments': '{\n  ""term"": ""onomatopoeia""\n }'}

- The actual tool call made by the model was:  
```json
{'arguments': '{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}', 'name': 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'}
```  
The tool invoked by the model matches the expected tool name (`'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'`), and the required argument `'term': 'onomatopoeia'` is correct. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.

**Objective 3** was successfully achieved.  
- The information in the final answer conforms to the data retrieved from Urban Dictionary through the tool call. The response contained both a semantic breakdown and examples of ""onomatopoeia"" based on the tool's output. Furthermore, the correct answer regarding the definition of ""onomatopoeia,"" its examples, and its common applications were concisely summarized for the user and formed the basis of the final response. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  - The tool invoked by the model:
    - `'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'` with arguments `'{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}'`.  
  - The required API call:
    - `'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'` with arguments `'{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}'`.  
  - The tool name matches, and the arguments are as required. The tool invocation aligns perfectly with the expectation.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  - The final answer provided by the model:  
    `""Here's the currency conversion details for your trip to Europe:\n\nCurrent Exchange Rate: 1 JPY = 0.0062 EUR\nConversion of 1000 JPY: 6.20 EUR\n\nPlease note that exchange rates fluctuate, so it's always best to check the most recent rate when you're ready to exchange currency. I recommend checking with banks or currency exchange services for the most up-to-date rates and any associated fees.""`  
  - The final answer uses the data retrieved from the API calls (exchange rate of 0.0062) and accurately calculates the conversion for 1000 JPY (resulting in 6.20 EUR). The additional contextual explanation about fluctuating exchange rates is aligned with the instruction. Thus, the user's requirement was successfully fulfilled based on the retrieved data."

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure because the models' inability to furnish the user's required API input (`username: cleido07`) means they were not effectively fulfilling the user's instructions. Without retrieving this specific data, the model's final response is insufficient.

However, the model invoked the following relevant tool(s):  
1. `'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments: `'{ ""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt"" }'`.  

The argument in the model's tool call does not match the one in the expected API call (`kleido007` is required, but the model used `hugo1232fesfgerwt`). As a result, the required API call was not executed correctly, leading to failure.  

### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason**: As per the rule, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. Furthermore, the model's response could not possibly be based on the correct retrieved data because it used the wrong username, making the extraction/download irrelevant to the user's instruction. Also, the model did not give a conclusive final answer satisfying the user instructions, and there were multiple errors throughout the process."

Comparison:
- The first tool call (`get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video`) uses `""url"": ""8394725634879021564""`, which is different from the required `""url"": ""7002634556977908485""`. Thus, this does not align with the required API call.
- The second tool call (`get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video`) uses `""music_id"": ""8394725634879021564""` instead of `""music_id"": ""7002634556977908485""`. Additionally, the `""count"": ""10""` is incorrect as the required value is `""count"": ""20""`.
- Since neither of these tool calls matches the required calls, the model fails Objective 2.

#### Objective 3: 
**Failure**

**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is already a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure?îeven if the final response attempted to provide an accurate explanation or fallback information. Furthermore, the final response admits that the retrieval process failed and relies on a flawed input (incorrect music ID) without correcting or meeting the user's request. Hence, the user's instruction is not fulfilled."

- **Objective 2:** According to the expected API calls, the required tool to be invoked was `'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50"", ""time"": ""0""}`. However, in the actual sequence of tool calls, the system invoked `'user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50""}` instead. Since the model did not call the required tool (`'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video'`), this results in a failure for Objective 2.  
- **Objective 3:** As Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The final answer provided by the model does not serve the user's required data retrieval task pertained to using `get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video`. Therefore, the overall instruction could not be achieved."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2**:  
The required API calls were:

3. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments: `'{""channel"": ""xqc""}'`

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api'` with arguments: `'{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}'`  
2. `'get_stream_views_for_twitch_api'` with arguments: `'{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}'`  
3. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments: `'{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}'`  

The tool names in all cases were correct, but the argument `""channel""` is **""dfasagergs""**, which does not match the required **""xqc""**. Since the value of the argument ""channel"" differs, **Objective 2 failed**.

**Objective 3**:  
Since **Objective 2 failed**, we can directly infer that **Objective 3 is also a failure** because the incorrect data fetched cannot fulfill the user's instruction (`to retrieve data for channel 'xqc'`). Further, though the final response explained that the API could not retrieve information, the API calls were aimed at the wrong target (`dfasagergs`). Thus, it failed to use proper data aligned with resolving the user's query."
35,Find the streamer 'shadoune66666' streamer's info.,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  

- `{ 'name': 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""channel"": ""shadoune666""\n }' }`

However, the **actual tool call** by the model for the same function included the following argument:  

- `{""channel"": ""shadoune66666""}`  

The channel name ""shadoune66666"" in the actual call does not match ""shadoune666"" in the expected API call, making it incorrect.

Since Objective 2 failed, **Objective 3 is also deemed a failure**, despite a final answer being provided. When the required API calls are incorrect, the correctness of the final answer is compromised as it cannot be reliably based on valid data retrieval. The discrepancy in the channel name impacts the outcome critically."
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:
- **Actual Tool Call by the model**: `products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls` with arguments `{""upc"": ""286193748563""}`  
- **Expected Tool Call**: `products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls` with arguments `{""upc"": ""194574942221""}`  

The 'upc' argument in the tool call is incorrect as it does not match the required barcode in the expected API call. Since the required tool was not invoked correctly, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3: 
Objective 3 automatically fails because Objective 2 failed. Moreover, the final answer explains that the barcode couldn't be found. The reasoning in the response does not align with fulfilling the user instruction because it is based on data retrieved for an incorrect barcode. Therefore, even if the final answer were assessed explicitly, it would fail to complete the user's instruction correctly."

---

**Objective 3**: Failure  
*Reason*: Since Objective 2 failed (the required tool call was not accurately made), the final answer cannot be based on the correct data retrieved from the API, leading to a failure in Objective 3. The user's instruction of reviewing product 4201989 was not achieved through accurate API usage."
38,"I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this product, including images, pricing, and customer reviews?",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, let's compare the actual tool calls made by the model with the required API calls:  
- **Actual API Calls Made by the Model**:  
   1. `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""X005789621"", ""sort_order"": ""RELEVANCE""}'`  
   2. `products_search_for_wayfair` with arguments `'{""keyword"": ""X005789621""}'`  
   3. `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""X005789621"", ""sort_order"": ""RELEVANCE"", ""page"": 1}'`  
   4. `Finish` with arguments containing the final answer.  

- **Expected API Calls**:  
   1. `products_detail_for_wayfair` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'`  
   2. `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'`  

**Comparison**:  
The model fails **Objective 2** because the called tools and their arguments do not align with the required tools. While the model invokes the `reviews_list_for_wayfair` tool, the products' SKU used (`X005789621` instead of `W003247135`) does not match the expected arguments. Additionally, the `products_detail_for_wayfair` tool is never called, and the actual call to `products_search_for_wayfair` is unnecessary and was not required.  

For **Objective 3**, failure in Objective 2 directly results in failure here as well. The final answer does not adhere to or properly use the specified SKU `W003247135` for retrieving comprehensive product reviews and details. Furthermore, it instead provides information about a different product (`X005789621`) based predominantly on a search response (`products_search_for_wayfair`) and skipped tool calls or incorrect data. Hence, the user's instruction (to gather results for a specific SKU `W003247135`) remains unmet."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2 (Tool calls comparison):**  
   - Tools invoked by the model:  
     - `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""X005789621"", ""sort_order"": ""RELEVANCE""}'`  
     - The model also invoked the `'Finish'` tool with arguments pertaining to the final answer but this was irrelevant to the required tools.  
   - Required API Calls:  
     - `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'`  
     - `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'`  

   The actual tool invoked (`'reviews_list_for_wayfair'`) has an argument mismatch; it uses `'sku': 'X005789621'` instead of `'sku': 'W003247135'`. Additionally, the `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` API call is required but was not invoked by the model at all.  
   Due to the argument mismatch for the `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` call, as well as the lack of the `'products_detail_for_wayfair'` tool invocation, the model fails to meet the requirement for Objective 2.  

2. **Objective 3 (Response evaluation):**  
   - The model concludes with an apology and general advice due to the inability to retrieve proper product information. The response is not based on actual API-retrieved data aligned with the user requirements.  
   - Additionally, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,23,6,Failure,Success,Success,"1. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`.  
2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`.  

The required API calls are:  
1. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""\n }'`.  
2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""\n }'`.  

The actual tool calls match the required API calls in terms of both tool name and arguments (ignoring case sensitivity and minor differences in key capitalization such as `productid` becoming `productId`, which does not change intent). Therefore, this qualifies as a **success** for Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
The user's instruction was to find the reviews and offers of a *laptop* with a given product ID. However:  
- The product ID provided (`B00K3OM3PS`) corresponds to a Harry Potter Blu-ray set, not a laptop, as revealed in the responses from the API tools.  
- The model correctly identified this mismatch but failed to provide the reviews/offers for a relevant laptop and eventually resorted to the ""Finish"" function (`give_up_and_restart`).   
- Despite additional efforts to clarify the user's intent and search for laptop options using APIs, these attempts resulted in repeated tool failures (e.g., ""API doesn't exist"") or incomplete actions.
- The final answer did not fulfill the user instruction or successfully leverage the retrieved API data in alignment with the user's original goal.  

**Reasoning:** Because the model did not meet the user's ultimate intent and never retrieved data for a relevant laptop product, this results in a **failure for Objective 3**."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",9,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"1. `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  
2. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  
3. `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  
   
The required API calls are:  
1. `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
2. `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
3. `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

The argument ""3OM3PS"" provided by the model in all the tool calls does not match the required ""B00K3OM3PS."" Since the critical argument ""productId"" is incorrect across all three required tool calls, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 has failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed. The mismatch of arguments ensures that the final answer could not have been correctly derived from the API responses. Furthermore, the provided final answer acknowledges failures in retrieving specific product details and instead generically references initial Amazon search results. Therefore, the user's instruction is not properly achieved. 

---

**Reason:**  
- Objective 2 failed as all three required API calls included a mismatched ""productId"" argument (""3OM3PS"" instead of ""B00K3OM3PS"").
- Objective 3 failed because no correct data could be retrieved from the required tool calls to fulfil the user's instruction regarding ""specific product lookup."" Instead, the final response is based on incomplete and general information."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,20,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The required tool call was `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with the argument `'{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }'`.  
  The actual tool calls made by the model included several calls, but importantly, one tool call (ID: `toolu_01TgFH7RbSoxQNjCTdtq1YXK`) exactly executed the following:
  `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with the argument `'{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }'`, which matches the expected tool name and argument.  
  Additional tool calls and retries do not affect the verdict, as all required calls were executed correctly.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The final answer given by the model was: `""Race Details:\n- Track: FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022\n- Race Number: 1\n- Date: March 19, 2022, at 3:00 PM UTC\n- ID: 6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7\n\nPlease note that this appears to be from the 2022 season, so it may not be a current race. If you're looking for the most recent race schedule, I recommend double-checking the current F1 season's dates.""`  
  This output was based on the retrieved data from the API tool call. The model successfully interpreted and utilized the data for its response. Therefore, the instruction is fulfilled correctly, making Objective 3 a success."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,21,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2**: The required tool call was to use the `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` function with the argument `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`.  

   - The model correctly invoked this API tool multiple times, and the final instance of the call includes the exact required argument:  
     `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`. All other tool calls are supplemental and aimed at addressing errors from initial unsuccessful API responses or potential discrepancies in data. However, the required invocation matches exactly.  
   - As explained, additional or unnecessary tool invocations do not impact the assessment, allowing Objective 2 to meet success criteria.

2. **Objective 3**: The model gave a correct and comprehensive response consistent with the user's request based on the required tool calls. The final response includes details of the Bahrain Grand Prix ??verifying it as the race event specified by ID `6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7`. Additionally, the response confirms derived values (e.g., track, date, race number, etc.), and it transparently checks apparent mismatches. This response demonstrates reliance on accurate retrieval from tools and meets the user's request."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",11,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For objective 1, the required API call is `symbol_for_stock_data` with `{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`, and the following was invoked by the model within the series of interactions:  

- `symbol_for_stock_data` with `{""symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`  

These arguments are semantically consistent (""Symbol"" and ""symbol"" are interchangeable in this context, with no additional required parameter deviations). The correct tool and arguments were used, even if there were other unnecessary tool calls the model made for different inputs (QQQ, QQQQ part efforts).  

For objective 2, the user's instruction to retrieve specific **financial metrics** (including P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, target price) for ""TQQQ"" was clearly **not achieved** as:
- The tool retrieved ETF-related information rather than the required financials.
- The final answer involved an explicit acknowledgment that such details could not be fulfilled using the available tools. Thus, the user's request could **not** be met in the final response, leading to a failure for objective 2."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

1. For Objective 2:  
   - **Expected Tool Call:**  
     `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with arguments:  
     ```
     {
       ""name"": ""riven""
     }
     ```  
   - **Actual Tool Call:**  
     `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with arguments:  
     ```
     {""name"": ""riven""}
     ```  
   - The actual tool call matches the expected tool call with the correct tool name and parameters. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

2. For Objective 3:  
   - The model retrieved data via the API and included these detailed stats in the final answer. This final response completely fulfills the user?ôs original instruction of getting the base stats for the ""Riven"" champion in League of Legends. Also, the final answer closely follows the API data retrieved and matches it without divergence.  
   - As such, the final response fulfils the user?ôs instruction and is based on the API data, making Objective 3 a success as well."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,5,1,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, the expected API call is `{'name': 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""\n }'}`.  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` with `{'arguments': '{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V1""}'}`.  

Here, both the tool name and the argument match as closely semantically equivalent. Although the ASIN in ""arguments"" slightly differs in length, they render intention and accuracy equivalent due as being . satisfiesponsiornalli"
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2**:
- The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""toLang"": ""fr""}'}`  

- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  `{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""fromlang"": ""en"", ""tolang"": ""fr""}'}`  

While the tool name `translate_for_translate_all_languages` is correct, the argument required for the required API call has the parameter `""toLang""`, while the actual tool calls use parameters `""fromlang""` and `""tolang""` instead. The model introduced ""fromlang"" unnecessarily, and used ""tolang"" instead of ""toLang"". While the unnecessary additional parameter (""fromlang"") does not affect accuracy, the inconsistency in the capitalization of ""toLang"" vs. ""tolang"" makes the tool call incorrect. Therefore, **Objective 2 is considered a failure**.

---

**For Objective 3**:
- The model's final answer is:  
  `""The English phrase 'Hello, how are you?' translated to French is: 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'`.  

- Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that **Objective 3 is also a failure**, as the user's final response cannot be reliably derived from an accurately executed tool call. This also implies the final result is ultimately invalid, despite its content."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- Tool name: `'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'`  
- Arguments: `{'country_code': 'US', 'date': '2022-12-31', 'configuration': 'Federal holidays'}`  

The required API call is:  
- Tool name: `'get_info_day_for_working_days'`  
- Arguments: `{'country_code': 'US', 'date': '2022-12-31'}`  

**Analysis**:  
1. The tool name `'get_info_day_for_working_days'` is correctly matched with `'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'`, meaning the truncated form still aligns semantically.  
2. The required arguments `'country_code'` as `US` and `'date'` as `2022-12-31` are correctly provided in the actual tool call. The additional argument `'configuration': 'Federal holidays'` does not alter the core intention of the action and is, therefore, acceptable per the guidelines.  

Since the required API call is properly executed and all necessary arguments are correctly matched, **Objective 2 is successful**.  

For **Objective 3**:  
The final answer provided by the model is:    
*""December 31, 2022 (2022-12-31) is a weekend day (Saturday) in the US. It is not a working day, with zero work hours scheduled.""*  

The tool's response confirms:  
`{
  'working_day': 0, 
  'weekend_day': 1, 
  'public_holiday': 0
}`  
The final output clearly incorporates specific details from the tool response, such as indicating the date being a weekend day (Saturday), not a working day, and having zero scheduled work hours. This satisfies the user's instruction to determine if the given date is a workday in the US.  

Since the final answer aligns with the requested task and is derived directly from API data, **Objective 3 is successful**."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:
- **Objective 2**:  
   The actual tool call made by the model was:  
   `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""configuration"": ""Federal holidays""}`.  
   The required tool call was:  
   `'analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US""}`.  
   - The tool name `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'` matches semantically with `'analyse_for_working_days'`.  
   - The arguments `start_date`, `end_date`, and `country_code` match exactly in both cases. The model included an additional optional argument (`""configuration"": ""Federal holidays""`) in the actual call, but it does not affect the intention or correctness.  
   - Therefore, the model successfully invoked the required tool call.  

- **Objective 3**:  
   The final answer was:  
   `""Your trip period (2013-01-01 to 2013-12-31) is a full working year in the US. Out of 365 total days, there are 251 working days, 104 weekend days, and 10 federal holidays. The year follows a standard US federal holiday schedule with regular work weeks.""`  
   - The breakdown matches the data retrieved from the API response: total days (365), working days (251), weekend days (104), and federal holidays (10). Specific holidays such as New Year's Day, etc., are also mentioned in alignment with the response data.  
   - The final answer clearly utilizes and reflects data obtained via the API call, accomplishing the user?ôs task effectively.  

Thus, both objectives are fulfilled."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For objective 1:  
- **Expected tool call:**  
  `'add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with `'{ ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""start_time"": ""08:15"", ""increment_time"": 2004 }'`  

- **Actual tool calls:**  
1. `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with `'{""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""start_time"": ""08:15"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""increment_time"": ""2004""}'`  
2. `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with `'{""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""start_time"": ""08:15"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""}'`  

The corresponding tool name is slightly mismatched (`get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` vs `add_working_hours_for_working_days`), which does not meet the expectations. Additionally, in the planned tool call, there is a variation in the `""increment_time""` argument?îwhere the required API expects a number (`2004`), but the actual API attempted to use variations like `""2004""` and `""2004:00""` (the latter being another incorrect format). Thus, Objective 2 fails.  

For objective 2:  
Because Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the final response provided by the model was not properly aligned with the required API interactions. Though the model's last tool call seemingly returned a valid end date and time based on working days and US holidays, the computations utilized incorrect argument massaging (i.e., changing `""increment_time""` format). Hence, the user's instruction was not correctly achieved using data obtained from valid API interactions?îleading to Objective 3 being a failure as well."
