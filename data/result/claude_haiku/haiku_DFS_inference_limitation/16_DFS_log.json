These tools seem to be project or health-related functions, but they do not offer IP address tracking or geolocation services.\n\nTo provide geolocation data for an IP address, you would typically need an IP geolocation API that can:\n1. Accept an IP address as input\n2. Return location details like city, country, latitude/longitude, timezone, etc.\n\nExamples of such services include MaxMind GeoIP, IP-API, or IPify, but none are present in my current toolset.",
