I'll manually calculate this since there's no specific function for age calculation.\n\nCalculation:\n- First person (born 1997-02-28)\n- Second person (born 1987-06-30)\n- Difference: 9 years, 7 months, and 29 days\n\nLet me break this down:\n- Years difference: 1997 - 1987 = 10 years\n- Months difference: From June to February crosses year boundary, so it's slightly less than a full 10 years\n- Precise calculation shows: 9 years, 7 months, and 29 days\n\nFinal answer:",
