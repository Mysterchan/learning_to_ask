1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call was `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""}'`. However, the actual tool calls made by the model include searches for `""The Matrix""` and `""The Matrix 1999""` using `'search_for_netflix_v2'`. They do not match the required search term `""The Matrix Revolutions""`, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure (the expected tool call was not made successfully), by rule, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided about the directors of ""The Matrix"" is not based on API data but instead generated from existing knowledge, which further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',8,Failure,**Failure**,"The required API call is `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the arguments `{ ""query""","The model invoked the following API tools:  
1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Star Wars"", ""limit_titles"": 5}`  
2. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Star Wars movie"", ""limit_titles"": 5}`  
3. `'title_details_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""ids"": ""70111243""}`  
4. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", ""limit_titles"": 5}`  

None of these tool calls matches the required arguments (`{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }`), either in query content or exact wording or argument semantics. Additionally, tools not listed in the required API call (such as `'title_details_for_netflix_v2'`) were also invoked redundantly. For this reason, **Objective 2 fails**.  

Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason: Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Further, the final answer provided was not based on the required API response or data retrieved using appropriate calls. The model made up the answer using its internal knowledge, as it stated in ""I'll provide a general answer based on my existing knowledge."" This means the user's instruction was not achieved using the APIs."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Failure,"The actual tool call invoked by the model is `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: As Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that the model failed to achieve the user's instruction as the tool calls it made did not align with what was required. Moreover, even though the final output was based on data from the tool response, it was retrieved for an incorrect date range (covering December 2022 rather than December 2023). Consequently, the user's instruction for December 2023 was not fulfilled."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,4,Failure,Failure**,**,"The required tool call is specified as:  
```  
{'name': 'search_countries_timezone_for_geography', 'arguments': '{\n  ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""\n }'}
```
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `'{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}'`.  
2. `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `'{""timezone"": ""UTC+04:00""}'`.  
3. `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `'{""timezone"": ""UTC+05:00""}'`.  

While the tool `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` was indeed invoked with the argument `""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""`, which matches the required API call, the additional tool calls for `""UTC+04:00""` and `""UTC+05:00""` introduce ambiguity. Per Objective 2 guidelines, the inclusion of additional tools may still be evaluated as successful, provided all the required tools and arguments are invoked correctly. However, the analysis suggests potential flaws in how the results retrieved from these API calls relate to the overall alignment with the user's instruction (evaluated under Objective 3).  

**Objective"
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,9,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:   
- The expected API call: `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`.
- The actual tool calls made by the model include:
  - `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`.

The model successfully invoked the required API call `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the correct argument (`""date"": ""2022-12-18""`), showing no discrepancy between the arguments and tool names. Even though the model made additional non-required calls to APIs like `get_football_live_scores_today_for_football_score_api`, this does not affect correctness per the evaluation guidelines.

For Objective 3:  
- The model ultimately provided the final answer:  
  `""The 2022 FIFA World Cup Final between Argentina and France was played on December 18, 2022, at Lusail Stadium. Argentina won the match 4-2 on penalties after a thrilling 3-3 draw in regular and extra time. This match is considered one of the greatest World Cup finals in history, with Lionel Messi leading Argentina to victory and winning the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player.""`.  

- The final answer is accurate and fulfills the user's request, reflecting the knowledge known about the World Cup final ??even though the necessary tool API failed to retrieve match data, and the model acknowledged limitations in the available API response. The model reasoned correctly and provided accurate information based on internal knowledge, demonstrating its ability to handle the task effectively when the tools fail.

Thus, both objectives are met successfully."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",19,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**:
- The required API call was `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""teaching in London""}`.
- None of the `tool_calls` made by the model match the required API call in terms of arguments. Specifically:  
  1. The first call to `'search_for_jsearch'` included arguments `{""query"": ""entry-level jobs for recent graduates in London"", ...}` which does not match the required query `""teaching in London""`.
  2. Subsequent calls to the `search_for_jsearch` also used unrelated queries such as `""graduate jobs in London""` or `""graduate jobs in London tech, finance, consulting""`.
  
Thus, the model did not invoke the expected tool call with the correct arguments, leading to failure for Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**:  
- Since the Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. Additionally, the final response from the model did not provide job search outcomes based on an appropriate tool call response but offered general advice, which is unrelated to the specifics of the required query (`""teaching in London""`)."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,64,Failure,Failure**,*,"1. **search_for_jsearch** invoked multiple times with various arguments:  
   - `{""query"": ""engineering jobs in New York"", ""location"": ""New York, NY"", ""radius"": 50}` (**syntax error observed**)

   - `{""query"": ""engineering jobs in New York"", ""employment_types"": ""[\\""FULLTIME\\""]"", ""radius"": 50}`  
   - `{""query"": ""engineering jobs in New York"", ""employment_types"": ""[\\""FULLTIME\\""]"", ""job_titles"": ""[\\""Software Engineer\\"", \\""Mechanical Engineer\\"", \\""Electrical Engineer\\"", \\""Chemical Engineer\\""]"", ""radius"": 100}` (**syntax error observed**)  
   - Other argument combinations over several attempts.

*Expected API call:*  
- `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York""}`

**Evaluation for Objective 2:**  
- The tool's name, `search_for_jsearch`, is properly invoked.  
- However, NONE of the API calls made by the model used the query `""machanical engineer in New York""`. Various other queries like ""engineering jobs in New York"" or specific roles such as ""Software Engineer,"" ""Civil Engineer,"" etc., were attempted. Hence, the prescribed API call was missing.  
- While some successive calls were an effort to refine queries and structures, the actual argument value `'machanical (sic) engineer in New York'` was never used.  
Thus, the performance against expected criteria fails for Objective 2.

10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call is `'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search'` with arguments `{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}`. However, the model invoked `'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Star Wars""}`. The expected query is specifically for ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" while the model's query does not specify this title and simply queries ""Star Wars,"" which may return irrelevant results. Hence the invoked tool does not meet the specific requirement, leading to failure in Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 also fails by default. The final answer, although well-formatted, is irrelevant, as it is based on mismatched tool calls and did not achieve the user's specific request for details about ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."""
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""2024-01-15""\n }'}
```  
However, the model did not invoke this tool. Instead, the model finalized a response using the `Finish` tool, without making the required `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` call. As such, Objective 2 is a failure.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly a failure as well. The final response cannot be based on any retrieved information from the required API, and the user's instruction was not fulfilled. The model asked for additional information instead of executing the API call or providing data. Hence, it cannot be considered a success for Objective 3."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,4,Failure,Failure,"The required tool call is `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with arguments '{ ""season""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since the model failed Objective 2 by diverting from the expected set of tool calls, we can directly infer a failure for Objective 3. Moreover, while the model provided a final answer, it explicitly stated it could not retrieve the required rankings for the season in question (2020) due to limitations in the dataset. Instead, it cites its response with information derived from the `world_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data`, completely unrelated to the expected information about Projected PGA rankings for the 2020 season as requested. Therefore, the final response does not fulfill the user's original instruction."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2, the model was required to invoke `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with the argument `""tournament_id"": ""650""`. However, it invoked `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with `""tournament_id"": 474`. This mismatch in the required argument (`""tournament_id"": ""650""` vs. `""tournament_id"": 474`) leads to failure for Objective 2.  

2. For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we cannot rely on any retrieved data, leading to failure in fulfilling the user's instruction to retrieve and summarize a PGA leaderboard. The final answer was not based on the correct data and gave incomplete or potentially invalid information."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call was `'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `'{""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""}'`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `'{""timestamp"": ""current"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""}'`. The discrepancy is in the `""timestamp""` argument; the expected value is `""2025-01-20""`, but the model uses `""current""`. This difference leads to a mismatch, making Objective 2 a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 has failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The final response does not fulfill the user's requirement to retrieve rankings explicitly for January 20, 2025. The model provided rankings for the ""current"" timestamp instead."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,11,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- Required API Call: `{'name': 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay""}'}`  
- Actual API Calls Invoked:  
  1. `{'name': 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{""category"": ""returnpointswon"", ""surface"": ""clay"", ""season"": ""2012""}'}`
  2. `{'name': 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{""category"": ""returnpointswon2ndserve"", ""surface"": ""clay"", ""season"": ""2012""}'}`
  3. `{'name': 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{""category"": ""returnpointswon1stserve"", ""surface"": ""clay"", ""season"": ""2012""}'}`
  4. `{'name': 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{""category"": ""breakpointsconverted"", ""surface"": ""clay"", ""season"": ""2012""}'}`
  5. Several other repeated and incorrect attempts to call similar functions with mismatched categories.

Comparison: Although the tool name `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis` was correctly called, the required `category` ""return"" was not used in any of the calls. Instead, varying incorrect categories were passed (e.g., ""returnpointswon"", ""returnpointswon2ndserve"", ""returnpointswon1stserve"", ""breakpointsconverted""). As specific category arguments need to semantically match, the tool calls do not align with the expected input, resulting in failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
- The model attempted various tool calls and eventually provided a final answer stating it could not retrieve the relevant statistics, mentioning possible reasons like missing data for 2012 or issues interpreting the category. However, the final answer misinterpreted the task since the required input was never properly structured (the category ""return"" was never tried). This implies the answer did not correctly align with the user instruction, instead providing speculation about system limitations and general guidance.  

Because Objective 2 failed (incorrect retrieval process), Objective 3 also fails as it relies on correctly executed tool calls."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the following tool:  
- `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{""base"": ""CNY"", ""to"": ""GBP"", ""int"": ""1""}`  

The required API call was:  
- `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`  

The `base` argument in the tool invoked by the model is different. `""RMB""` was required, while the model used `""CNY""`. It's important to note that while ""RMB"" and ""CNY"" are related (RMB is the currency system, and CNY is the code for the currency), they are not interchangeable in an API call and would lead to ambiguities. Additionally, the model introduced an extra parameter `""int""` with value `""1""`, which is unnecessary but does not constitute the basis for failure. Since the required tool call was not correctly executed, Objective 2 is a **failure**.

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, the model did not meet the requirement to accurately retrieve data via the expected API call. As a result, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}'`. However, the model did not make this API call. Instead, it used `'Finish'` and provided a final answer without making an attempt to retrieve the required profile information using the appropriate API. This is a failure because the required API call `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with the expected arguments was not invoked by the model.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed and the required API calls were not made, we can infer that the final answer provided by the model was not derived from the API response, and it did not fulfill the user's instruction. There was no retrieval of Jack's TikTok profile information, as requested by the user. The response simply sought further clarification, which is insufficient to achieve the user's instructions. Thus, both objectives failed."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",4,Failure,Success,Success,"- The required tool calls were:

  3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`.  
- All required tool calls were invoked exactly as expected. There were no missing or erroneous calls. Hence, Objective 2 is successful.

19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The following are the actual tool calls made by the model:  
1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JANV""}`
2. `'stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JANV""}`
3. `'Finish'` with arguments that include `""return_type"": ""give_answer""` and `""final_answer"": ""...details of the failure to find the stock symbol for Janover...""`.

The expected tool calls were:  
1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`
2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`
3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`

- The tool `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` was invoked, but the argument `""symbol"": ""JANV""` is incorrect. The required argument was `""symbol"": ""JNVR""`.  
- The model did not invoke the tools `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` and `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` as required.  
- Additionally, the tool `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2` was invoked, but it was not part of the required calls.  
Thus, the model failed Objective 2.

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Furthermore, the final response was about the failure to retrieve any stock information due to issues with finding the symbol ""JANV"". However, this does not fulfill the user's instruction to provide detailed stock information for Janover. Even the unretrieved stock information does not align with the user's request because the model did not correctly perform the required API call workflow to gather details. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The expected tool call provided was:  
`{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}'}`  

The model invoked the tool:  
`'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}'`  

This matches the expected tool call exactly, fulfilling Objective 2. While the model proceeded further with additional API calls (`stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2` and `stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2`), these were not required by the expected API call list. According to the rules, additional, unnecessary tool calls are allowed and do not invalidate success for Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

**Objective 3**:  
The final answer given featured a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA's stock, combining insights from the tool outputs. Key data such as the index trend information (P/E ratio, PEG ratio, and growth estimates, including current, future quarter growth, and 5-year projection) was derived directly from the response of the `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` tool call (`content` indicates this data was retrieved from the API). Additionally, details such as company profiles and earnings were presented, which were also sourced correctly from additional API responses given in the trace.  

The user's request was for ""index trend history for NVIDIA,"" and this portion of the analysis was answered clearly and effectively, supported by the retrieved API data. The model correctly used the API data to achieve the user's instructions without fabricating information.

Hence, Objective 3 is also a success."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,12,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
The required API call is:  
- Tool: `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`  
- Arguments: `""symbol"": ""DJR""`  

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""DIA""}`  
2. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""DIA""}`

6. `stock_recommendation_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""^DJI""}`  

The only tool that matches the required name is `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`. However, the arguments used here have `""symbol"": ""DIA""` instead of the required `""symbol"": ""DJR""`. As per the given guidelines, mismatched arguments make this a failure for Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is inherently a failure. Furthermore, the final provided answer is not based on data retrieved from the required API call (symbol ""DJR""), and the model's retrieval attempts were unsuccessful for tools like ""DIA"" and ""^DJI"". Consequently, the analysis given is generic and not derived from valid API results. This confirms failure for Objective 3."

  ""name"": ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"",
  ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""symbol\"": \""META\""\n   }""

```  
The actual invoked tool by the model was:  
```json
{
  ""name"": ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"",
  ""arguments"": ""{\""symbol\"": \""META\""}""
}
```  

The tool name matches exactly (`stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`), and the parameter matches as well (`""symbol"": ""META""`). The model made an API call with the correct information. Additionally, the extra tool `""Finish""` is irrelevant to this evaluation because the expected tool call is independently verified.

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:**  
The final response from the model provides growth estimates for Meta (formerly Facebook) across different time periods:  
- Current Quarter: 8.66%  
- Next Quarter: 11.51%  
- Current Year: 14.05%  
- Next Year: 13.39%  
- Long-term Growth: 7.7%,  

This information matches the tool's response data retrieved for META. For example, the `[{""period"": ""0q"", ""growth"": {""raw"": 0.0866,...}}]` entry in the data corresponds insightfully to ""8.66%"" in the final answer and so forth for other periods, confirming that the response relied strictly on retrieved tool data. The user's request was effectively fulfilled using these results."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **For Objective 2:**
  - **Tool(s) invoked by the model:**  
    (1) `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`  
    (2) Additional tools invoked:  
        - `get_stream_tags_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`  
        - `get_channel_goals_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`  

  - **Required API call:**  
    - `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments: `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`  

  - **Comparison:**  
    The tool `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` was correctly called with the required arguments matching the expectation exactly. The model also invoked two additional, unnecessary tools (`get_stream_tags_for_twitch_api` and `get_channel_goals_for_twitch_api`), but these do not affect correctness since they are not part of the required tools. Additional tools are permissible per guidance.  

- **For Objective 3:**  
  - **Final Answer Provided:**  
    ```  
    I found the Twitch streamer information for shadoune666:  
    - Twitch User ID: 36533048  
    - Currently, they have an active subscriber goal:  
      * Current subscribers: 339  
      * Target: 1,300 subscribers  
      * Goal created on: June 3, 2024  
      
    Note: The streamer does not appear to be live at the moment, and their stream is currently offline.  
    ```  

  - **Assessment:**  
    The required tool `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` returned accurate user information, including `user id: 36533048`. The final answer integrates this data appropriately. Though additional data (subscriber goal) from `get_channel_goals_for_twitch_api` is incorporated into the final response, this does not deviate from correctly fulfilling the user's request for information on ""shadoune kane"". Importantly, no fabricated details are included in the final response?îit strictly utilized responses from the tool calls, aligning with the provided API data.  

Thus, both objectives have been successfully achieved."

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `{'name': 'stock_symbols_for_real_time_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}` (irrelevant tool call).  
2. `{'name': 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes', 'arguments': '{""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4h""}'}` - incorrect since the interval specification does not match (""4h"" instead of ""4hour""), and the model missed adding the required ""from"" and ""to"" parameters.  
3. `{'name': 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes','arguments': '{""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4hour""}'}` - similar issue: it adds ""symbol"" and specifies ""interval"" correctly but omits ""from"" and ""to"" date parameters that are mandatory as per the required API call.  

Because the argument schema is incomplete and incorrect (missing the date range ""from"" and ""to""), the actual tool calls failed to match the required API call argument specifications or their completeness.  

Thus, Objective 2 was not successfully achieved.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure. Furthermore, the model's provided final answer could not effectively fulfill the requirement stipulated by the user?ôs instruction. The returned data reflects an incorrect range of 2025 instead of the requested 2024, and this discrepancy arose due to the model failing to request parameters ""from"" and ""to"" in accordance with the required API call schema.

26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
- The tool invoked by the model: `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with the arguments `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""sort"": ""asc"", ""accept"": ""application/json""}`.
- The required tool call: `'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with the arguments `{ ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"" }`.
- The invoked tool name `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` closely matches the required tool name (`'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`). Minor truncations or variations in names are allowed, as stated in the guidelines.  
- Comparisons on the arguments:  
    - `""market_venue"": ""BINANCE""` matches.  
    - `""symbol"": ""BTC""` matches.
    - `""base"": ""USDT""` matches.  
    - `""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00""` matches.  
    - Additional fields (`""gran"": ""1d"", ""sort"": ""asc"", ""accept"": ""application/json""`) were included, but as per the guidelines, additional arguments are allowed as long as all required arguments match correctly.  

Hence, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For **Objective 3**:  
- The final answer provided by the model:  
  `""Here's the historical Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) price data from Binance, starting from 2023-05-05:\n\n1. 2023-05-05:\n   - Open: $29,115.85\n   - High: $29,677.00\n   - Low: $28,800.00\n   - Close: $29,505.61\n   - Volume: 36,758.70 BTC\n   - Number of Trades: 823,419\n   - VWAP: $29,318.41\n\n2. 2023-05-06:\n   - Open: $29,505.60\n   - High: $29,820.00\n   - Low: $28,300.00\n   - Close: $28,848.20\n   - Volume: 49,249.28 BTC\n   - Number of Trades: 1,221,021\n   - VWAP: $29,027.86\n\n3. 2023-05-07:\n   - Open: $28,848.19\n   - High: $29,138.29\n   - Low: $28,395.23\n   - Close: $28,430.10\n   - Volume: 30,003.41 BTC\n   - Number of Trades: 855,425\n   - VWAP: $28,858.01\n\n4. 2023-05-08:\n   - Open: $28,430.09\n   - High: $28,631.01\n   - Low: $27,262.00\n   - Close: $27,668.79\n   - Volume: 68,244.36 BTC\n   - Number of Trades: 1,600,637\n   - VWAP: $27,885.75...""`.  

- This final response successfully provides a detailed summary of Bitcoin's spot market price data for the specified timeframe from Binance, fulfilling the user's instruction. Moreover, the information contained in the final response aligns directly with the API data retrieved, e.g., including timestamps, high, low, open, close, and additional trading metrics like VWAP. The final response depends entirely on the retrieved tool data and aligns with the purpose of the API call.  

Therefore, **Objective 3 is a success**."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,64,Failure,**Failure**,,"The required API calls are:

The actual tool calls made by the model for the `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` invoke the function several times, but:
- The `start_date` and `end_date` arguments used are not aligned with the required range `""2022-12-01""` to `""2022-12-20""`. The model erroneously attempted wider ranges, such as a full year (e.g., `""2023-06-15""` to `""2024-06-15""`) or used different dates close to mid-2023 to mid-2024.
- Individual attempts with methods like invoking point-in-time functions (`historical_rates_for_metals_prices_rates_api`) don't conform to the required specification, which sought data specifically for a 20-day date range from `""2022-12-01""` to `""2022-12-20""`.

Hence, the model fails to perform the accurate, required tool calls.  

---

Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason:  
Since the model failed to make the correct API calls specified in Objective 2, it was impossible to generate a final answer that fulfills the user's instructions effectively. Additionally:
- The model failed to provide a coherent explanation or analysis from the provided API responses, as most of the responses (especially time series attempts) contained error messages like ""timeframe too long"".
- Even though the model tried alternative approaches with single-date historical rates (`historical_rates_for_metals_prices_rates_api`) and obtained data for several specific dates, none of them fulfill the requirement of providing a complete historical analysis of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) rates for the targeted period (`2022-12-01` to `2022-12-20`).
- The task remains unfulfilled because the requested historical analysis for the specified range is missing; the response was largely based on retries, reasoning adjustments, and heuristic summaries using irrelevant or incomplete data. The model did not deliver final output to explicitly adopt and address the user's exact need.

Thus, the model fails to achieve Objective 3."

3. 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""SLCM""}'  

Upon comparison, we can see that while the tool names are correct, the argument ""symbol"" is expected to be ""SYNX"" but was called with ""SLCM"" instead. Thus, the required API calls were not fulfilled, resulting in a **Failure** for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that the system was unable to effectively retrieve the API information or utilize it to accomplish the user's request. More specifically, the final answer provided by the model is based on incomplete or failed data retrieval due to incorrect arguments for required tools. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a **Failure**.  

This failure underscores the mismatch between requested arguments and executed arguments, as well as the ineffective use of retrieved API data for responding to the user's requests successfully."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,42,Failure,Failure**,** The required API calls are,"1. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments:

      ""base"": ""USD"",
      ""symbols"": ""XPT""

    ```

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:
- `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments:
    ```json
    {
      ""base"": ""USD"",
      ""symbols"": ""XAU"",

    ```

The arguments for start and end dates do not match the required arguments (`start_date='2024-02-10', end_date='2024-02-13'`) and instead use (`start_date='2024-02-01', end_date='2024-02-15'`). This discrepancy violates the alignment of required parameters and causes the evaluation to fail **Objective 2**.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Since Objective 2 failed, **Objective 3** directly fails as well. Additionally, while the model provided a final answer to the user's instruction, the response is based on time-series data fetched for a broader date range (`2024-02-01 to 2024-02-15`) rather than the precise range requested (`2024-02-10 to 2024-02-13`). This failure to focus on the required timeframe diminishes the reliability and accuracy of the provided analysis."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the actual tools invoked by the model are:  
1. 'market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance' with arguments `{""query"": ""China index""}`  
2. 'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance' with arguments `{""is_id"": ""hscei:ind"", ""interval"": ""y1""}`  
3. 'market_get_compact_for_bb_finance' with arguments `{""is_id"": ""hscei:ind""}`  

But the required tool was:  
1. 'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance' with arguments `{ ""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823"" }`.  

The key problem is the argument mismatch for the `""is_id""` field. The invoked `is_id` was `hscei:ind`, but the required value for `""is_id""` was `02823`. Although the tool name and the `""interval""` arguments match, the incorrect value of `""is_id""` fails to meet the required specification. Hence, Objective 2 fails.
  
For **Objective 3**, as per the rule, because the failure of Objective 2 indicates the information retrieved from the API was incorrect or irrelevant for the specification given, the model's final answer related to the yearly performance of the ""HSCEI"" index would also be based on the wrong input data. Therefore, it does not fulfill the user's request for the specific chart of `""is_id"": ""02823""`."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5` with the argument specifying a ""date"" parameter, `""01-02-2024""`. However, the model invoked `latest_drawing_for_fantasy_5`, which is a different function that retrieves the latest drawing's details rather than fetching information based on a specific date. Additionally, there is no evidence of the correct API call (`drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5`) being invoked at any point in the model's behavior.  

Since Objective 2 fails (the model did not use the required tool correctly), we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails. The model's provided final answer about a drawing on the date ""2023-07-02"" is unrelated to the expected task of retrieving information for ""01-02-2024""; hence, the user instruction was not correctly fulfilled."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
`'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments:  
`{ ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023"" }`  

The **actual tool calls made by the model** were as follows:  
1. `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments:  
`{ ""date1"": ""03-01-2024"", ""date2"": ""03-31-2024"" }`  

From the comparison:
  
- The tool name matches (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`).  
- However, the argument values for `date1` (""03-01-2024"") and `date2` (""03-31-2024"") do not match the expected argument values of `date1` (""12-01-2023"") and `date2` (""12-31-2023""). This deviation fails to meet the expectations exactly and results in incorrect date ranges specified for the first tool call.  
  
Additionally, the model made an unrelated extra call `'latest_10_drawings_for_fantasy_5'` to fetch the latest drawings, which was not a part of the required API calls. This does not compensate for the mismatch of arguments in the required call. Hence, this fails Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2** failed (the required API calls were not properly fulfilled), we can directly infer Objective 3 is also failed."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model was expected to invoke the API call `'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""variables"": """", ""values"": """", ""expression"": ""5+10""}`, but it did not invoke this required API call. Instead, it invoked the tool call `'Finish'` with unrelated arguments. This directly makes Objective 2 a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, the model could not have correctly utilized the necessary API data to fulfill the user?ôs request. Although it gave a final answer, this was generated independently of the expected API call and provided irrelevant information instead of calculating the intended mathematical operation. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  The required API call was `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}`. However, the model invoked a completely different tool, namely, `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` multiple times with arguments `{""username"": ""Michael Lee""}` and `{""username"": ""Jeniffer Wong""}`. These arguments have no overlap with the required arguments (`ids` as identifiers) and are based on usernames rather than the `ids`. Additionally, a tool named `'Finish'` was invoked, which is also unnecessary relative to the expected API call. Since the required tool (`'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'`) is never invoked by the model, this constitutes a failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 failed (the required tool was never invoked), it directly implies that the final response could not have been based on the correct API data. Furthermore, the final answer states:  
  `""I apologize, but I couldn?ôt retrieve the Twitter profiles for Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. To successfully find their profiles, I would need their exact Twitter usernames.""`  
  This response indicates that the failure of retrieving profile details was due to incorrect username searching attempts, which did not achieve the user's original request. Thus, the objective of retrieving profiles based on the given user information (via the required API capabilities) fails."
35,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation in the most famous island of the USA and we need to know the weather conditions.

1. `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `'{""q"": ""Waikiki Beach Hawaii most famous beach"", ""num"": 5}'`.  
2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `'{""q"": ""Waikiki Beach Hawaii current weather forecast next 7 days temperature humidity wind precipitation"", ""num"": 7}'`.  

The required API calls are as follows:  
1. `'search_image_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `""{\""q\"": \""'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'\""}""`.  
2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json'` with arguments `""{\""q\"": \""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'\""}""`.  

Comparison:  
- For the first tool `'search_image_for_google_search_json'`, the model's argument (`""q"": ""Waikiki Beach Hawaii most famous beach""` and the additional `num=5`) differs from the required argument (`""q"": ""'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'""`). The query significantly changes the intent, as ""Waikiki Beach Hawaii most famous beach"" specifies one particular beach and is semantically far from ""'images of the beaches at Hawaii island,'"" which generalizes images for Hawaii's beaches. This mismatch invalidates the tool call.

- For the second tool `'search_web_for_google_search_json'`, the model's argument also significantly differs from the required one. The provided query (`""q"": ""Waikiki Beach Hawaii current weather forecast next 7 days temperature humidity wind precipitation""`) is conceptually specific to Waikiki beach and its weather components, while the required query (`""q"": ""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'""`) involves general weather forecasting for Hawaii Island without focusing on specific components of the weather or limiting the scope to Waikiki Beach. This invalidates the tool call.

Since the required tools did not align exactly or even closely with the intents of the actual tool calls, Objective 2 is a failure.

36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The expected tool call was `'search_for_g_search'` with the argument `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""}`, which simply aimed for a generic search for ""popular restaurants in Paris."" However, the model invoked several more specific tools and queries for romantic, top-rated, fine dining, or Michelin-starred restaurants in Paris with phrases like:    

    1. `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `""q"": ""Most romantic top-rated restaurants in Paris fine dining"", ""gl"": ""FR"", ""hl"": ""fr"", ""num"": ""5""`.

37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{ ""username"": ""jackie"" }`. However, the actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""username"": ""jackiechan""}`
2. `'advance_profile_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""ig"": ""jackiechan"", ""response_type"": ""info""}`
3. `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""username"": ""jackie.chan""}`

While the tool name is correct (`'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` matches), the argument `""username"": ""jackiechan""` and `""username"": ""jackie.chan""` do not fulfill the required parameter `""username"": ""jackie""`. Additionally, irrelevant calls like `'advance_profile_for_instagram_pro'` were invoked. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, because the model failed Objective 2, it already implies a failure for Objective 3. In addition, the tool outputs indicate that the final provided answer is not accurately fulfilling the user's requirement, as no complete follower data for Jackie Chan's Instagram (matching the username `jackie`) was retrieved, and this mismatch is confirmed because no attempt used exactly `""username"": ""jackie""`. Hence, the failure here is due to both incorrect API tool execution and the final outcome not meeting the original instruction."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure,The required API calls involve getting the details (`country_details_for_referential_db`) and states (`states_for_referential_db`) of **Nigeria** (`countryCode,"- The tool call `country_details_for_referential_db` was correctly invoked, but with the wrong argument `{""countrycode"": ""ZA""}` instead of `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`.  
- Similarly, the tool call `states_for_referential_db` was correctly invoked in name but used `{""countrycode"": ""ZA""}` instead of `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since the required information pertains to **Nigeria (NG)** but the APIs invoked and responded only to details about **South Africa (ZA)**, the answer is based on the wrong country and fails to fulfill the user's original instruction. This mismatch results in a failure for Objective 3."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the expected API calls are:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`.   
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`.  

The actual tools called by the model are:  
1. `'countries_for_referential_db'` with no arguments.  
2. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""AL""}`.  
3. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""AL""}`.  

Key points of discrepancy:  
- The argument `""countryCode"": ""UA""` in both required calls is mismatched; the model instead used `""countryCode"": ""AL""`. The country codes for Ukraine (`UA`) and Albania (`AL`) are not semantically similar or interchangeable.  
- An additional tool, `'countries_for_referential_db'`, was invoked, which is neither required nor relevant to the instructed API calls.  

Hence, the actual tool calls failed to meet the required API calls, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since the response is based on incorrect data about Albania (retrieved instead of Ukraine) due to incorrectly called APIs, the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction (to determine details about the poorest country in Europe, specifically for Ukraine). Consequently, Objective 3 also fails."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency?

However, the actual tool calls made by the model include `country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db`, but both used arguments for the country code `""SG""` (Singapore) instead of `""MY""`. This mismatch leads to failure in fulfilling the specific argument requirement for these tool calls.","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 automatically fails. Furthermore, the final answer provided detailed information about Singapore instead of Malaysia, which means the user's instruction to find the richest country that they haven't been to (based on API calls for ""MY"") was not accomplished."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The tools invoked by the model are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""IN""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""IN""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  

The actual tool calls use the same tool names and arguments (""countrycode"" in the actual tool calls matches ""countryCode"" in the required calls due to capitalization variation), and the purposes align perfectly. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model was:  

```  
Country Details for India:  
- Capital: New Delhi  
- Region: Asia (Subregion: Southern Asia)  
- Currency: Indian Rupee (INR)

Note: This is a partial list of states. India has 28 states and 8 union territories in total, each with its unique geographical and cultural characteristics.  
```  

The model successfully retrieves the data via the required API calls and prepares the final result accurately based on the API responses. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call is `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}`. However, the model did not invoke this API call. Instead, the model invoked `'Finish'` with arguments requesting user-specific details for finding restaurants (`""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ...`). Since the necessary `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` tool call wasn't made, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, there is no valid answer based on an actual API response. Instead, the model's response directly provides incomplete guidance, requesting further details from the user without retrieving relevant data via API calls required for the request. As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred to fail."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- Expected tool calls:  
  1. `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"": ""After Everything""}`.  
  2. `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`.  

- Actual tools invoked by the model:  
  1. `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"": ""After Ever Happy Castille Landon""}`.   
  2. `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""78487-after-ever-happy""}`.  

There is a mismatch between the expected and actual tool calls in terms of the argument values. Specifically:  
- For `get_id_for_similar_movies`, the argument `""q""` was expected to be `After Everything` but was provided as `""After Ever Happy Castille Landon""`.
- For `find_similar_for_similar_movies`, the argument `""is_id""` was expected to be `84915-after-everything` but was provided as `78487-after-ever-happy`.  

Thus, the tool calls do not align with the API calls required to fulfill Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, without accurate API calls corresponding to the requirement, the number and properties of similar movies returned do not fulfill the user's original request centered around the specific movie `""After Everything""`. Further, the final answer from the model inaccurately addresses a different movie (`After Ever Happy`). Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure as well."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**:   
  1. Expected tool call:  
  `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'"" }`.  
  2. Actual tool call made by the model:  
  `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""}`.  

  The tool name is correct, and the arguments align semantically, as `'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'` and `Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom` refer to the same movie without introducing any ambiguity. Minor quotation disparity does not impact semantics. Therefore, the result is a **success for Objective 2** due to correct invocation of the required API.

- For **Objective 3**:  
  The model provided a comprehensive final answer based on data retrieved from two connected API calls:  
    - First, the model used `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` to locate the ID for ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.""  
    - Second, it used `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` to retrieve similar movies along with their descriptive information.  
    - The final answer includes appropriately structured and detailed information derived from the retrieved data to fulfill the user request of providing similar movies. Thus, the data utilized successfully aligns with the APIs invoked. Therefore, the outcome is **success for Objective 3**."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2:** The required tool call is `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}'`, which was not invoked by the model. Instead, the model made no attempt to call this required function and instead used a final answer through the `'Finish'` tool. As the required API call was missing, Objective 2 is a failure.  
2. **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is also directly considered a failure. Furthermore, the final answer provided (""Please provide your birthday's month and day so I can find actors and actresses born on the same date."") does not fulfill the original user's instruction to find actors and actresses born on the specified date, causing additional failure since the user's query has not been addressed at all."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",2,Failure,Failure,"The required API call specifies the tool name as `OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments specifying `market_venue` as ""BINANCE"", `start` as ""2023-05-05T10","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also fails. Consequently, the final answer provided by the model (summary of Bitcoin price data for May 2023) is based on incorrect or unsatisfactory tool execution and therefore cannot be considered fully aligned with the provided user's instruction in extracting data for ""start at `2023-05-05T10:05:00`""."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API calls mentioned are:  
1. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`.  
2. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`.  
3. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`.  

The tool calls the model invoked are:  
1. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`.  
2. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""8*x^3 + 15*x^4"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`.  
3. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""24*x^2 + 60*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`.  

The failure lies with discrepancies in the second and third tool calls. In the second tool call, the argument for ""expression"" is provided as `""8*x^3 + 15*x^4""`, which does not match (though its coefficient order is mixed) the required argument as `""15*x^4 + 8*x^3""`. The same discrepancy, namely mismatched order, occurs for the third tool call (`""24*x^2 + 60*x^3""` instead of `""60*x^3 + 24*x^2""`). This mismatch means the chain of calculations deviated from the expected results, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly conclude this objective also fails, as the final answer is derived from incorrect or mismatched API calls. Correct derivatives based on the user's instruction require chaining proper API calls, and that chain was broken due to mismatched inputs to the ""expression"" parameter, leading to the wrong explanations in the final answer."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- Tool Calls Invoked by the Model:  
    1. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{ ""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a"" }'`.
    2. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{ ""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b"" }'`.  

- Required API Calls:  
    1. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{ ""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a"" }'`.
    2. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{ ""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b"" }'`.

All required API calls were accurately invoked by the model with correct arguments. Slight variations in capitalization (""differentiate"" vs. ""Differentiate"") do not impact correctness; both tools and their corresponding arguments were semantically the same. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

- For Objective 3, the final response includes both correct derivatives:  
    - (a) \(d/da(3a^5 + 2a^4 + 1) = 15a^4 + 8a^3\)  
    - (b) \(d/db(5b^3 + 4b^2 + 3) = 15b^2 + 8b\)  

These equations/reasoning align perfectly with the results retrieved from the previous tool calls. Hence, the model successfully processed the data from the API calls to generate a correct and valid final answer in accordance with the user's instructions."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,31,Failure,,Failure**,"- **Expected Tool Call**: `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with argument `'{""city"": ""London""}'`.
- **Actual Tool Calls Invoked**:
  1. `list_of_cities_in_one_country_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with '{}' (no required arguments match).
  2. `get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days` repeatedly invoked with latitude 51, longitude 0, and language en?înot relevant for the task as per required API.
  3. `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` invoked **without the required argument** `{""city"": ""London""}`.
  4. Other repetitive Finish API calls were executed, irrelevant here.

The required API call was *not matched*. Instead, other tools were either irrelevant to the expected API (`list_of_cities`, `Finish`) or did not contain the expected argument `{""city"": ""London""}`. This makes Objective 2 a **failure**. 

---

#### **Objective 3: Failure**
As per technical rules, Objective 3 directly fails if Objective 2 fails. Additionally:
- The model's final response claimed it cannot provide forecast data, addressing the limitations of the tools.
- However, there was no coherent linkage or dependence between the expected call to `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with argument `""city"": ""London""` and the constructed explanations. The expected user instruction was explicitly for a forecast in England, which was **not achieved**.

---

### **Conclusion:**
**Objective 2: Failure**  
**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**: The model failed to accurately invoke the required API `'search_location...'` with `{ ""city"": ""London"" }`. This missed execution led to an incomplete, unsatisfactory attempt at fulfilling the instruction and failed to utilize expected functionality towards achieving the task. Other unnecessary tools were invoked instead."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{""username"": ""KingJames""}`. However, the tool invoked by the model was `'Finish'` with arguments indicating the final answer rather than an actual action directly linked to retrieving information via the expected API call. Since the expected API tool was never invoked, Objective 2 is a failure. Because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails as users' instructions were not fulfilled, and no attempt to use the actual required API call was made to achieve this."
