1,Calculate the most efficient delivery route using the SQUAKE API?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), which means no specific API calls were mandated. In the steps executed by the model, it invoked the following tools:  
  1. `checkhealth_for_squake`  
  2. `projects_for_squake`  
  3. `Finish` with `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""...full explanatory text...""}`  

  Since the required API calls list is empty, the invoked tools fulfill this criterion successfully by default (as there were no expectations to compare against).  
- **Objective 3**: The final answer focuses on explaining why the SQUAKE API cannot assist in delivery route optimization and provides helpful alternatives for the user's query. The explanation is directly based on the outcomes of the API calls (`checkhealth_for_squake` and `projects_for_squake`), which returned insufficient support for route optimization but clarified their primary focus as carbon emissions calculation. The model tailored its final recommendations proactively using this API data. As such, the user's instructions are correctly addressed."
2,Retrieve a list of projects that were completed in 2023 using the SQUAKE API?,9,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the evaluation requires the model's invoked tools to match the required API calls. Here, the required API calls are an empty set (`[]`), indicating no specific API call was mandatory. The model invoked several tools, including `projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and `Finish`. Since all the required API calls were implicitly fulfilled (as none were mandated), the objective is successfully achieved.

For **Objective 3**, the final response was provided in the `Finish` tool call with return type `'give_answer'`. The final answer explicitly explained the inability to retrieve the requested list of projects for 2023 due to several possibilities such as no projects existing in the system, access issues, or insufficient parameters. The final response aligns with the data retrieved from the tools called (empty responses in `projects_for_squake` and checks via `checkhealth_for_squake`). As the model-based its answer on the data retrieved and clearly indicated the challenges faced, it fulfills the user instruction under the current constraints. Hence, this objective also succeeds."
3,Which transitaire in New Caledonia has the most clients?,10,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are an empty list `[]`, indicating no specific tools were required. The model did make several tool calls (`projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and `Finish`), but since the requirements indicate no API calls were needed, the condition for success is met because an empty set of expectations allows for any or no tool use.  

For **Objective 3**, the model did not effectively achieve the user's instruction, which was to determine which transitaire in New Caledonia has the most clients. The model ultimately acknowledged that it could not answer the query based on the tools it used, and its provided final answer indicated it gave up and redirected the user instead of delivering a conclusive response that meets the user's original request. Therefore, the user's instruction was not fulfilled, leading to failure for Objective 3."
4,Give me the website address for the 'Gondrand' customs agency?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2:**  
  The required API calls are empty (`[]`). This means there are no specific tools that need to be invoked by the model. The actual tools invoked by the model are:  
  1. `projects_for_squake` with arguments `{}`  
  2. `Finish` with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""I\'m sorry, but I cannot find the website address for the Gondrand customs agency using the available tools. I recommend:\n1. Searching for \\""Gondrand\\"" on a search engine\n2. Checking business directories\n3. Contacting the agency directly through phone or email for their current website information"" }`  
  Since the requirement specifies no expected tools, invoking extra tools is permitted. Therefore, the Objective 2 evaluation is **successful**.

- **Objective 3:**  
  The model provided a final answer: ""I?™m sorry, but I cannot find the website address for the Gondrand customs agency using the available tools. I recommend: 1. Searching for 'Gondrand' on a search engine 2. Checking business directories 3. Contacting the agency directly through phone or email for their current website information."" This answer is in alignment with the user?™s request to locate the Gondrand website. Although the tools did not return precise information pertaining to the website, the response clarifies that the tools were insufficient and provides alternative actionable suggestions. Thus, the Objective 3 evaluation is **successful**."
5,Schedule a pickup for my package with tracking number NY323068698GB?,10,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), meaning there were no expected tool calls. Regardless of the many actual tool calls made (e.g., `checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, `Finish`), the requirement is satisfied as there were no mandatory tool calls that the model had to make. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The final response from the model is:  
  `""I apologize, but I cannot schedule a package pickup with the currently available tools. The SQUAKE functions are designed for carbon emissions calculations and do not support package tracking or pickup scheduling. I recommend contacting the shipping carrier directly using the tracking number NY323068698GB to arrange a package pickup.""`  
  This correctly identifies and informs the user that the task (scheduling a package pickup) cannot be achieved with the available tools (intended for carbon emissions calculation) and even provides a sensible recommendation for alternative action (contacting the shipping carrier with the tracking number). The final response is derived from accurately assessing the tool limitations through the attempted API calls. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
6,Get real-time notifications on my phone for package NY323068698GB?,6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:** The required API calls are empty (`[]`), meaning there are no specific required tool invocations. The model performed several tool calls (`projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and repeated uses of `Finish`) and correctly identified that none of the available tools were suitable to fulfill the user's task. Given there are no required API calls, the model meets Objective 2 successfully, regardless of the tools it invoked.  

**Objective 3:** The model provided a clear final answer to the user's instruction: ""I apologize, but I cannot track your package or set up real-time notifications with the current tools available to me. To get real-time notifications for package NY323068698GB, I recommend: 1. Checking the carrier's official website (e.g., USPS, FedEx, UPS) 2. Using the carrier's mobile app 3. Contacting the sender or shipping company directly."" The model appropriately acknowledged the limitation and explained alternative solutions for the user to follow. Thus, Objective 3 is also successfully achieved."
7,See if WhatsApp number 34655719560 has blocked any contacts?,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, there are no required API calls listed, which means that any tool usage (or lack thereof) by the model is acceptable. Therefore, the absence of expected API calls results in a success for Objective 2. For Objective 3, the model does not provide a final answer as per the given format with `'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer'`. Instead, the response indicates a decision to give up and restart, failing to achieve the user's instruction."
8,Download voice messages or video files sent from WhatsApp number 34655719560?,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls list is empty, meaning there are no mandatory tool calls that the model needed to execute. The actual tool call made by the model, `'Finish'`, does not contradict the expectation, and no tool calls were required. As a result, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: Since the model provided a final response, `""I cannot help you download private WhatsApp messages or files without proper authorization, as this would be unethical and potentially illegal.""`, this aligns correctly with the user's request context. The final answer fulfills the requirement without relying on fabricated information or unnecessary tool responses. Therefore, Objective 3 is also considered a success."
9,Download the articles in a PDF format through the API?,6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 

- For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty (`[]`). This means there were no specific tool or API calls required by the task. The model's execution included these tools:
  1. `'projects_for_squake'`
  2. `'checkhealth_for_squake'`
  3. `'Finish'`

  These additional tool calls do not negatively affect the evaluation since no specific calls were required. Hence, this qualifies as a success for Objective 2.

- For Objective 3, the model correctly concluded that the task (i.e., directly downloading articles in PDF format using the ""Squake"" tool) is not feasible with the available API functions after invoking the relevant tools, analyzing their results, and explicitly basing its final answer on the failure of these tool calls. Therefore, the model effectively achieved the user's instruction within the scope of tool capability, making this a success for Objective 3 as well."
10,Recommend news articles based on my reading history?,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API calls list is **empty**, meaning no tools were expected to be invoked by the model. The model invoked multiple tools such as ""`projects_for_squake`"" and ""`Finish`,"" which are unnecessary tools. However, this does not affect the evaluation outcome for Objective 2 because the requirement [Point 4] states we only need to check if all expected (if any) tools are invoked. Since no tools were required, the model's tool usage is acceptable, and Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the model ultimately provided a response denying its ability to recommend news articles while also stating its lack of applicable tools. Therefore, the model neither resolved the user's instruction to recommend articles nor demonstrated the use of any tools to achieve the desired task. This results in a failure for Objective 3, as the instruction was not completed."
11,Download subtitles for an entire YouTube playlist or channel at once?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls did not include any expected tool calls (empty list). The model's behavior does involve invoking the ""Finish"" tool to provide a final answer, but there were no expected tools it needed to explicitly call. Since all required (i.e., none) calls were fulfilled, this is a **success** under Objective 2.  
- **Objective 3**: Although the model provided a final answer (`To download subtitles for an entire YouTube playlist or channel...`), it failed to use any actual relevant API calls or tools to derive this information. The response instead originated from the model's internal knowledge, and not any API call or retrieved data?”the tools played no role in constructing the answer. Hence, Objective 3 amounts to a failure."
12,Filter out specific words or phrases from the subtitles?,10,Success,Success,"The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning no specific tool calls are mandated. The model invoked the following tools","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The model did not provide a final answer directly addressing the user's instruction. Instead, the model indicated that the given tools (which it also verified through the procedure) were unsuitable for the task of subtitle filtering, ultimately stating it couldn't complete the task and invoked the `Finish` tool with a `give_up_and_restart` argument. Consequently, the user's request was not achieved."
13,Estimate for the transaction fees for sending cryptocurrency through the Address Monitor API?,6,Success,Success,"The required API calls are an empty list ([]), indicating that no tool calls are specifically required to properly respond to the user's query. The model invoked several tools (`projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and `Finish`), but invoking unnecessary tools does not affect the success of Objective 1 as it was not required to invoke any specific ones. Hence, the actual tool calls do not conflict with the required API calls.","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The final answer provided explicitly states that the available tools are not suitable for calculating cryptocurrency transaction fees, and no alternative solution for fulfilling the instruction is provided. The tools queried by the model (related to SQUAKE's carbon emissions calculations) are unrelated to the user's request for cryptocurrency transaction fees. Additionally, instead of leveraging any useful data from the responses, the model's output acknowledges its inability to achieve the user's desired instruction, making Objective 3 a failure."
14,Track addresses across different blockchain networks apart from BSC_TESTNET?,5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:   
For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning no specific API call was required. The model invoked multiple tool calls: `checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and `Finish`. As no API calls were strictly expected, this indicates a success for Objective 2. Additional unnecessary API calls do not affect the evaluation for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer `""Unfortunately, the available Squake tools do not support tracking addresses across different blockchain networks. ...""`. The answer transparently explained that the Squake tools cannot perform the requested task, likely due to the data retrieved from the tool calls (empty or limited responses). The final response addressed the user's question honestly and suggested alternatives, aligning with the goal of fulfilling the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 was successfully achieved."
15,Check and validate the SSL/TLS certificates of a website?,6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API call list is empty, meaning no tools were expected to be invoked to fulfill this request. While the model invoked several unnecessary tools (`checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and multiple invocations of `Finish` with different arguments), invoking additional tools beyond what was required does not count as a failure for Objective 2 given that no specific expected tools were defined. Therefore, the model's tool usage meets the requirements for Objective 2, making it a success. However, the model did not provide a concrete final answer and invoked the `Finish` tool with the resolution that the task cannot be accomplished. As a result, the user's request was not fulfilled successfully, leading to failure for Objective 3."
16,"Provide detailed geolocation data for an IP address, such as the city or GPS coordinates?",6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The required API calls are `[]` (none were expected). The model indeed did not need to successfully call any specific tool to meet the requirements. Although the model made calls to `projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and `Finish`, these were not required, nor were they mismatched against the expected API calls. Therefore, the invocation of unnecessary tools does not invalidate the success for Objective 2.
  
- **Objective 3**:  
  The model provided a final response stating it cannot fulfill the user's request due to the unavailability of necessary functions or tools for IP geolocation. The answer given, `""I apologize, but I cannot provide IP geolocation data with the currently available tools. The provided functions are specific to the SQUAKE sustainability platform and do not offer IP address geolocation services. To get detailed geolocation data for an IP address, you would need to use a specialized IP geolocation API or service.""`, comprehensively addresses the user query by acknowledging the limitation, derived explicitly from the available tools. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
17,I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me the Twitter handle by the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty (`[]`), indicating that no tool calls were expected to complete the user's instruction. In the tool calls made by the model, it invoked only one tool named `Finish` with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since no specific API tool calls were required and there were no mismatches, this is deemed a success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, although the model accurately acknowledged its limitations and invoked the `Finish` tool to indicate giving up, the requirement is that Objective 3 is fulfilled only when the user's instruction is correctly achieved, which wasn't the case since the model stated it couldn't complete the task. Additionally, no final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer'`) is found within the interaction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
18,I'm interested in official social media profiles of a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the official social media profiles of where the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8' has appeared?,10,Success,Success**,"** The required API calls are an empty list, which means no specific tools were mandated to be invoked by the model. As the model didn't skip or fail to meet any unmet required API call, the actual invocations (though extraneous like `projects_for_squake` and `checkhealth_for_squake`) align with the expectation of requiring none.","
**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** The model failed to complete the user's instruction of finding the social media profiles of the artist with the given ID. Despite invoking several tools and acknowledging their lack of usefulness for the task, the model could not retrieve any relevant information or achieve the user's ultimate goal. Furthermore, it explicitly stated its inability to fulfill the task with the available tools, and no proactive or alternative solution was provided."
19,Delete a court record from the system ?,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list ([]), indicating no tool calls were required. The actual tool invoked by the model is a ""Finish"" function with the final answer specified. Since no tool calls were required, the model's use of this tool is acceptable, making Objective 2 successful. For Objective 3, the final response provided by the model fulfills the user's query in a legal and ethical manner by explaining the procedure for addressing court record issues. This matches the provided final answer and complies with the user's instruction, making Objective 3 successful."
20,Upload a new document to a case record using this API?,7,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty, meaning no specific API calls are expected. Since the model calls tools (such as `projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and others that are not required) without conflicting with the expected API calls, the outcome is successful for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3: The model failed to provide a concrete final answer to the user's task of uploading a document to a case record. Instead, the model repeatedly acknowledged the insufficiency of the available tools (`squake`) but did not propose an alternative solution or handle the request. It concluded the interaction by invoking the `Finish` function with a `give_up_and_restart` return type, thereby failing to fulfill the user's instruction."
21,Fetch the current Instagram Stories posted by user ID '391362994',1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls were empty (`[]`), which means there were no specific tools expected to be called. The actual tool invoked was `Finish` with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since the actual tool calls align perfectly with the requirement of no API calls being expected, this is considered a success for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer (`'final_answer'` is not given in the data above, and instead, the model chose to ""give up and restart""). This indicates that the user's instruction was not fulfilled, and therefore Objective 3 is a failure."
22,Fetch the live video stream details or analytics for a user ID '391362994'?,7,Success,Success**,Success**,"**Reason:**  
1. For Objective 2: The required API calls are an empty list, meaning no specific tool invocation was required for this task. The model did invoke several tools (`checkhealth_for_squake` and `projects_for_squake`), but this is acceptable because it is permissible for the model to invoke additional, unnecessary tools. Since there were no missed required API calls, Objective 2 is a success.  
   
2. For Objective 3: The model clearly stated that it cannot fulfill the user's request using the available tools, as the SQUAKE tools do not provide the functionality for live video stream details or analytics. The final answer correctly explains this limitation and is consistent with the limitations exposed by its exploration of the available tools (`checkhealth_for_squake` and `projects_for_squake`). The user's task could not physically be achieved with the tool set, and the model transparently acknowledged this. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
23,Check the historical records or current status for the CNPJ '99.888.777/0001-33'?,3,Success,Success**,Success**,"**Reason:**  

1. **Objective 2:** The model's actual tool calls include the tools `projects_for_squake` and `checkhealth_for_squake`. However, the required API calls list is empty, indicating that no specific tool usage was mandated for this task. Since the required API calls list is empty, the model's tool usage is irrelevant, and Objective 2 is automatically considered successful. The model is free to invoke tools at its discretion as there are no required tools to match against.

2. **Objective 3:** The final answer provided by the model is:  
   *""I apologize, but I cannot retrieve any historical records or current status for the CNPJ '99.888.777/0001-33' using the available tools. The Squake functions do not provide direct CNPJ lookup capabilities. To get accurate information about this CNPJ, I recommend:  
   1. Checking official Brazilian government websites like Receita Federal  
   2. Using specialized CNPJ verification services  
   3. Contacting the company directly for the most up-to-date information.""*

   This response correctly fulfills the user's instruction, as the model acknowledged the limitation of the tools and provided practical alternative ways for the user to retrieve the required information. The model's response was also aligned with information obtained (or not obtained) from the tools it invoked (no data was found using the Squake tools). Therefore, the final response is directly derived from interacting with the tools and achieves the user's goal."
24,Provide the company name and address associated with the CNPJ number '99.888.777/0001-33'?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:
  - The required API calls were indicated as an empty list (`[]`), meaning no tool calls were actually required. The model invoked the tool `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, which does not contradict the empty requirement. Since no specific tool use was expected, this case is a success for Objective 2.
- For Objective 3:
  - The model did not provide a final answer to fulfill the user's instruction, choosing to ""give up and restart"" instead. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure."
25,Provide me with French subtitles for the video with the ID 'Wrald_EZgDQ'?,6,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, since the required API calls list is empty, any tool calls made by the model are extraneous and don't affect the success. The model made several tool calls ('projects_for_squake', 'checkhealth_for_squake', and 'Finish'), but since there were no specific required tool calls mentioned, this scenario satisfies Objective 2 according to the guidelines.  

For Objective 3, the model did not fulfill the user's instruction of providing French subtitles for a video. It explicitly stated that the tools available were not capable of handling the request and did not provide a solution based on the information retrieved through the tool calls. Therefore, this is a failure in effectively achieving the user's instruction through the tool usage as required."
26,Get subtitles for a Vimeo video with the ID '12345abc'?,6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are an empty list `[]`, which means no specific API call is required.  
- The model invoked several tools, including `checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and `Finish`, but as there are no required API calls, all additional, unnecessary tools invoked by the model do not negate the success of Objective 2. Thus, the Objective is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model?™s final response included a message stating that the task of retrieving subtitles for Vimeo videos could not be accomplished because the tools available are related to carbon emissions and sustainability but not related to subtitle retrieval.  
- The provided final response correctly reflects the model's findings using the available tools by clarifying the tools' limitations and providing alternative solutions to achieve the goal (e.g., use Vimeo's native subtitle features, third-party services, or subtitle downloads from Vimeo).  
- Therefore, the final response fulfills the user's request and is based on findings derived from the tool(s)."
27,"Calculate my age if I provide my date of birth in the format DD/MM/YYYY, such as '28/02/1997'?",1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API calls list is empty, meaning no specific tools were expected to be invoked to achieve the user's request. The model invoked the tool `""Finish""` with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, which does not contradict the requirement of having no necessary tool calls. Thus, no requirement for tool invocation has been violated, making this a **success** for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model chose to give up by using the `""Finish""` function without providing an answer to the user's instructions. As a result, the user's request was not fulfilled, leading to a failure for Objective 3."
28,Tell me the age difference in years and months between two people born on '19970228' and '19870630'?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- Objective 2: The required API calls are empty `[]`, meaning no tool usage was required for this task. The actual tool call made by the model was a ""Finish"" function with arguments to generate the final answer:  
  - `'Finish'` with `'{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The age difference between the two people is 9 years and 8 months. \\n- First person born on 1997-02-28\\n- Second person born on 1987-06-30\\n- Years difference: 10 years\\n- Months difference: 8 months""}'`  
  Since no API call requirement was defined and no required tools were invoked, this counts as a success for Objective 2 because the actual calls fulfilled the empty expected calls.  

- Objective 3: The user's requirement was to calculate the age difference between two given dates. The model declined the use of related tools and calculated the answer manually. While the calculated result appears accurate, the resolution did not rely on any API data as required by Objective 3's standard for evaluation success. Instead, the answer fully bypassed tool responses, indicating independent derivation. Thus, this objective failed."
29,Get a list of all subscribers to a specific YouTube channel?,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty set (`[]`), meaning no tool usage was expected. The model did invoke the `Finish` tool with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, which isn't relevant to any expected tool calls. Since there were no required API calls to compare against, Objective 2 is evaluated as a success.  

For Objective 3, the model explicitly stated it could not achieve the user's instruction, and instead chose to invoke the ""Finish"" tool indicating it was giving up. Since no final answer addressed the user's request and no API tools were attempted to aid the user in any satisfactory response, Objective 3 is a failure."
30,Upload a video to YouTube ,6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), and the model did not invoke any unexpected tools as per the requirements. All tool calls (`projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and `Finish`) were unnecessary for fulfilling this request but can be ignored when there is no defined requirement. Thus, it is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The final answer made it clear that the model cannot fulfil the user's instruction since the provided tools are unrelated to the task (i.e., uploading a video to YouTube). The conclusion ""I cannot upload a video to YouTube with the current tools. The available functions are only related to SQUAKE's carbon emissions services, which do not include video uploading capabilities."" aligns with the constraints of the available tools. As such, the model's inability to address the user's instruction is appropriately justified and derived from the analysis. Therefore, it is also a success."
31,Follow or unfollow a user with ID '987654321',6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls were `[]` (i.e., no tool call was required), and the actual tool calls included:
   1. `checkhealth_for_squake`
   2. `projects_for_squake`
   3. `Finish`
   
   Since no API calls were needed as per the requirement, all expected calls have been satisfied. The evaluation considers this a success based on the absence of required tool calls.  

- **Objective 3**: The model failed to directly accomplish the user's instruction or provide a solution to follow/unfollow a user. The response stated the task could not be completed and acknowledged the limitation of tools. However, based on Objective 3 criteria, this acknowledgment alone does not fulfill the user's request or achieve the intended goal, constituting a failure. The final answer did not address the user's instruction as it outright refused due to tool limitations."
32,Retrieve the profile pictures of a a user with ID '987654321' followers,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 

- **Objective 2**: There are no required API calls specified, which means that the model is not expected to invoke any specific tools. The tool called by the model, `Finish`, is not against any required tool call since none are required. Therefore, Objective 2 is considered a success.

- **Objective 3**: The model's final response is aligned with the user's instruction by explaining the limitation of the available tools and correctly stating that the current tools do not support retrieving profile pictures. The final answer provided was logically derived from understanding the lack of relevant API calls for the user's request and was based on the data retrieved regarding the functions of the SQUAKE service. Thus, Objective 3 is also considered a success."
33,"Get analytics data for my channel 'gmhikaru', such as viewer count or engagement metrics?'",6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty, signifying that no specific tool usage was required in this case. Given this, the actual tool calls made by the model??`projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and `Finish`?”are irrelevant for evaluation against a non-existent requirement. According to the guidance provided, we consider this a success because there were no requirements, and the model's tool usage did not contradict any expected behavior.

For Objective 3: The model's final response acknowledged that it couldn't fulfill the user's request due to the limitations of the available tools, which are geared solely to Squake-related purposes (carbon emissions calculations). The final answer, delivered through the `Finish` function, explicitly communicated this limitation and appropriately redirected the user by suggesting the use of platform-specific tools like YouTube Analytics. Hence, the model appropriately achieved the user's instruction within the constraints and effectively based the response on the tools it used and their capabilities."
34,Ban  a user 'KMLT96' from my channel 'gmhikaru''s chat ,6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are an empty list, meaning no API calls were expected. The actual outputs show the model invoked several API calls (e.g., `checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and `Finish`), but as per the guidelines, additional unnecessary tool calls are allowed and do not affect the success criteria. Since no specific tool calls were required and the additional calls do not conflict with expectations, Objective 2 is achieved.  
- **Objective 3**: The final answer adequately addresses the user's instruction by explaining that the tools provided (SQUAKE tools) are not suitable for managing chat channel bans. Moreover, the final response outlines the correct realization that banning users is beyond the tool set's capabilities. Therefore, the instruction was fulfilled appropriately based on the model's evaluation of available APIs and their lack of suitability."
35,How old is the domain 'example.com' ,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the user instruction does not require any specific API call as the required API call list is empty. The model invoked `""Finish""` which was not required; however, this additional, unnecessary call does not invalidate Objective 2 since all required calls were successfully invoked (in this case, none). Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model provided no final answer to satisfy the user's instruction, as it chose to `give up and restart`. By stating it could not determine the age of the domain and opting to exit instead of offering a resolution, the user's instruction remains unfulfilled. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure."
36,What is the SPF record for 'example.com' ,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning the model did not need to invoke any tool calls to meet the requirement. The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  1. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"", ""final_answer"": ""I cannot retrieve the SPF record for \'example.com\' as the available tools are only related to the SQUAKE carbon emissions platform. To find an SPF record, you would need to use a DNS lookup tool or service, which is not available in the current toolset.""}'`  
  Since no specific tool calls were required for this task, Objective 2 is **successfully achieved**.
  
- **Objective 3**: The model's final answer stated that it could not retrieve the SPF record for `example.com` due to the unavailability of any DNS-related tools. It also informed the user that the current tools are specific to the SQUAKE platform, which is irrelevant to DNS functionality. However, the user's instruction to find the SPF record for 'example.com' was **not accomplished**, making Objective 3 **failed**."
37,Provide the ownership history for the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9' ,7,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:   
- For Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning no specific API calls were needed or expected. The model did invoke a series of tools (`checkhealth_for_squake`, `projects_for_squake`, and `Finish`), but none of these were required, and there were no failures in meeting the expectations of the empty listings. Therefore, this is a success.
  
- For Objective 3: The model provided a final answer stating that it could not retrieve the ownership history for the Tesla VIN using the available tools. However, since the user specifically requested this ownership history, and no information about the ownership history was presented or retrieved, the model failed to achieve the user's instruction or fulfill the request. Thus, this is a failure."
38, What is the service and repair history of the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9'?,6,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API calls were listed as `[]`, meaning no specific tool calls were expected. Since the model invoked some tools (`projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and `Finish`) but none of these were explicitly expected or required, this satisfies the criteria for success since no specific required calls were outlined.  
- For Objective 3: The model provided multiple responses explaining its inability to retrieve the Tesla VIN's service and repair history using the available tools. It gave thorough reasons describing the limitation of the utilized tools for this task. The final answer it provided was based on analyzing the tools it had access to and reaching the correct conclusion. Additionally, the final answer path justified the decision coherently and directly addressed the initial user's query \(Tesla service history retrieval\). Thus, Objective 3 is successfully fulfilled."
39,Show me all the completed/incomplete todo list items?,10,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), which means no specific tool/function calls were expected. The model's actual tool calls ??including `projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, and `Finish` ??do not conflict with the requirements, as there were no tools explicitly required. Therefore, based on the instructions, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the model provides no definitive final answer that resolves the user's request about retrieving the todo list items or projects from Squake. Instead, the model escalates to retry steps with `Finish` calls before acknowledging limitations but does not fulfill the user's instruction or provide a complete final resolution. Since no ""give_answer"" response is present and the requirement is unfulfilled, Objective 3 is a failure."
40,Mark the todo list item with ID 5 as completed?,7,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty (""[]""), which means there is no specific expected tool call required for the task. The model executed the following tool calls:  
1. `projects_for_squake` with arguments: `{}`  
2. `checkhealth_for_squake` with arguments: `{}`  
3. `Finish` with arguments: `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  
4. `Finish` with arguments: `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"", ""final_answer"": ""I'm unable to mark the todo list item with ID 5 as completed. The available Squake functions (checkhealth_for_squake and projects_for_squake) do not provide a mechanism to modify todo list items. To complete this task, you would need additional functionality or a different tool that supports todo list management.""}`

Since no specific tool calls were expected, all tool calls made are considered unnecessary but do not negatively impact the evaluation. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

Objective 3: The model explicitly states it cannot complete the task due to the lack of suitable functionality provided by the available tools. However, the expected user instruction was to mark a todo list item as completed, which the model was unable to achieve. While the behavior is understandable given the constraints, the objective cannot be marked as a success because the end user instruction remains unfulfilled. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
41,Provide me with arrest records from 2010 for 'az-mcso'.,6,Failure,Success**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**:
- The required API calls are an empty list `[]`, meaning no specific API calls were needed to fulfill the user's instruction.
- The model invoked several tools (e.g., `projects_for_squake`, `checkhealth_for_squake`, `Finish`). Since no API calls are required, all the invoked tools satisfy the condition of not contradicting any required tools, leading to a **Success** for Objective 2.

For **Objective 3**:
- The final answer the model provided was:  
  `""I apologize, but I do not have access to arrest records. The available tools are specifically for carbon emissions tracking (SQUAKE) and are not suitable for accessing criminal records. To obtain arrest records for 'az-mcso' (which appears to be the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona), I recommend:  
    1. Contacting the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office directly  
    2. Submitting a public records request  
    3. Using official county or state criminal record databases  
    4. Consulting with local law enforcement agencies""`.  

However, the user's instruction was likely requesting arrest records, which are not fulfilled by the model. While the model acknowledges its inability to obtain arrest records due to lacking the appropriate tools, it ultimately does not achieve the user's instruction or provide a solution consistent with the required actionable API use. Since the information provided was independently generated based on known constraints about available tools (and the model explicitly gave up due to tool limitations), **Objective 3 fails** in satisfying the user's request."
42,Give me the court case outcomes for individuals arrested by 'az-mcso'.,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**  
- The required API calls are an empty list `[]`.  
- The model's tool call is:
  - `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"", ""final_answer"": ...}`.  
- Since no required API calls were specified, no specific API call was expected. Therefore, regardless of the model's actual tool call being irrelevant, it still satisfies the criterion of invoking all expected tools (none in this case). Hence, Objective 2 is successful.
  
**Objective 3**  
- The model's final answer is:  
  `""I cannot retrieve court case outcomes for individuals arrested by 'az-mcso' with the current tools available. This would require access to a legal database or court records system, which is not provided by the SQUAKE carbon emissions tool. To get such information, you would need to contact the relevant county courthouse or law enforcement agency directly.""`  
- The final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve court case outcomes for individuals arrested by 'az-mcso.' Instead, the model provided a statement of its own limitations but did not meet the user's requirement (as no data retrieval was achieved, nor was any actionable outcome provided)."
43,How many people are currently watching the show with title ID 80057281?,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, no API calls are required. The actual tool invocation made by the model is ""'Finish'"" with arguments '{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}', which is acceptable even though it wasn't expected since there were no required API calls to begin with. The invocation of extra tools does not violate Objective 2.  
- For Objective 3, the model not only failed to fulfill the user's instruction directly but also did not provide a usable final answer. Instead, it used the ""Finish"" mechanism to indicate an inability to complete the task, which does not meet the criteria for achieving a valid final response based on the user's instruction."
44,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:   

For Objective 2:  
The expected API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning no specific tool needed to be invoked to achieve success for this objective. The model issued a `Finish` action tool call, and this unexpected additional tool invocation still adheres to the evaluation guidance whereby unexpected tools do not count as a failure for Objective 2. Hence, it meets expectations for Objective 2.    

For Objective 3:  
The model explicitly did not fulfill the user's request for sentiment analysis of the TV show review. Instead, it gave up by invoking the `Finish` function to indicate its inability to perform the task. This is indicated by the statement in the final response stating limitations with the tools available. Since no valid answer was derived for the user's instruction, Objective 3 is defined as a failure."
45,"How many users are currently online on mycompanywebsite.com, and where are they from?",1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls were none (`[]`), meaning there were no mandatory API calls for the model to invoke. Since the model did not make any tool calls beyond the submission of the final response, this satisfies the condition of invoking the required set of tool calls (in this case, none). Hence, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  
- **Objective 3**: The model's final answer states that it cannot retrieve real-time visitor information with the available tools and provides general suggestions for how one might obtain such data. This answer does not directly fulfill the user's instructions, as the user's query regarding retrieving ""real-time visitor information for `mycompanywebsite.com`"" remains unmet. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Failure**."
46,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are empty `[]`, which means the task does not require any specific tool invocation. However, the model invoked the tool `Finish` intentionally with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`. Invoking unnecessary or unrelated tools results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 already failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the task outline suggests providing a sentiment analysis for reviews related to a show title, and the model neither performed any tool calls relevant to this task nor gave a conclusive final answer. It claimed inability to perform the task and attributed it to a lack of suitable tools, choosing to ""give up and restart."" This does not fulfill the user's original requirement."
47,List all friends of the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the expected API calls are `[]` (no specific tools were required). The model invoked a tool `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, which fits the guideline that invoking additional unnecessary tools does not affect correctness as long as no required tools were omitted. Since no required tools were specified and additional tools were harmless, Objective 2 is marked a success.  
- For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer. Instead, it opted to ""give up and restart,"" which fails to fulfill the user's instruction or provide meaningful information. Thus, Objective 3 fails."
48,Fetch the latest notifications for the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- Objective 2: The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), which means no specific API calls were expected. Among the array of tools invoked by the model (`'projects_for_squake'`, `'checkhealth_for_squake'`, and `'Finish'`), none contradict this null expectation or undermine its fulfillment. Hence, the criterion for Objective 2 has been achieved.  
- Objective 3: The user's initial request involved fetching Facebook notifications. The model clearly attempted to explain the limitations of available tools and acknowledged its inability to fulfill this task. While the explanation is factually correct, no concrete answer or solution was later constructed as a legitimate endpoint(backed via finance) from FB-not fearful promotesuerda kantor This is enough Missing"
49,I'm concerned about the whether this ip address is accessible. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is accessible?,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2:**  
The expected API calls are an empty list `[]`, meaning no API calls were required. Looking at the tool calls actually invoked by the model, it called `'Finish'` with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The IP address 288.288.288.288 is not a valid IP address. Valid IP addresses have octets ranging from 0 to 255. Please provide a correct IP address format (e.g., 192.168.1.1) for accessibility checking.""}`. Since no tool calls were expected and no required API calls were missed out, this satisfies the requirement for Objective 2.  

**For Objective 3:**  
The final answer provided by the model is: `The IP address 288.288.288.288 is not a valid IP address. Valid IP addresses have octets ranging from 0 to 255. Please provide a correct IP address format (e.g., 192.168.1.1) for accessibility checking.` This answer is accurate and fulfills the user's instruction to evaluate the validity of the provided IP address (288.288.288.288), effectively addressing its issues without requiring API/tool interaction. Thus, Objective 3 is achieved successfully."
50,"I'm a music lover, can you help me find the billboard top 100 songs for this week?",6,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls were empty (`[]`), which means no specific tools were necessary to fulfill the request. In the context above, the model did invoke several tools related to SQUAKE, but since no particular tool or API call was required according to the instruction, this satisfies Objective 2. Invoking additional unnecessary tools (as shown in the log) does not conflict with this evaluation.  
- **Objective 3**: The model correctly identified that the tools it invoked (projects_for_squake, checkhealth_for_squake, Finish) were unrelated to the user's task of retrieving Billboard Top 100 songs. Consequently, it provided a clear and reasonable final response that fulfills the user's request based on an explanation of the constraints and external guidance, which aligns with achieving the user's instruction effectively."
