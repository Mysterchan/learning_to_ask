Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.realtor_api_for_real_estate_data: Data API for Realtor USAYou can use this API to get all the Realtor Property data, Realtor Agents data and Realtor School data.Currently it is from Realtor USA only.Contact me at: vuesdata@gmail.com or visit https://www.vuesdata.com for building custom spiders or custom requests.\n"
