1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
   The required API calls are:  
   1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
   2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

   The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
   1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}`  
   2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}`  

   Observation: Both the tool names match. However, the argument `""trackingNumber""` required by the expected calls is mismatched with `""trackingnumber""` used by the actual calls. Additionally, the tracking number value `YT2003521266065328` is completely different from the actual value used (`YT9999999999`). These discrepancies result in incorrect invocation of tools, hence causing a **failure** for Objective 2.

- For Objective 3:  
   Given that Objective 2 has failed, we can directly infer that the model's final response could not be adequately derived from the correct usage of tools. Furthermore, the final answer includes incorrect data that does not correspond to the required tracking number `YT2003521266065328`, further affirming its **failure** to achieve the goal."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",3,Failure,Failure**,**,"The model invoked two tools during the process:  
1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}`  
2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}`  

The required API calls were:  
1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

Although the tool names match, the tracking number argument does not match (""NY9999999990"" vs. ""YT2003521266065328""), rendering the tool usage incorrect. Thus, Objective 2 is a **failure**.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. As the tool calls were performed with incorrect arguments, the provided final answer regarding the package is not reliable and would not accurately address the user's instruction. The model did provide a final answer, but the inaccurate tool invocation means it misaligned with the expected result."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,3,Failure,** Failure,** Failure,"**Reason:**  

1. **Objective 2:** The required API calls include:  
   - `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` with `arguments: '{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}'`
   - `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` with `arguments: '{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}'`

   The actual API calls invoked by the model are:  
   - The `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` tool with `arguments: '{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}'`  
   - The `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` tool with `arguments: '{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}'`  

   Issue: Despite having a similar tool calling pattern, **the app ID provided in the actual API calls differs from the required API calls**. The required ID is `1053012308`, whereas the actual ID is `1053012309`. Since the argument ""is_id"" is incorrect, we categorize this as a failure for Objective 2.

2. **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed, it directly implies a failure for Objective 3 because the incorrect data was gathered due to an incorrect API call. Additionally, while the model acknowledges errors via its dialog (e.g., indicating ""app not found"" and similar), it still **does not resolve the user's query by accurately fetching information based on the expected correct app ID**."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool call `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{ ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023"" }`, which aligns perfectly with the expected API invocation `{ ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023"" }`. No arguments were missing, incorrect, or misspelled, and there were no impediments due to unnecessary tools affecting the requirement. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The final answer accurately fulfills the user's request by summarizing the Fantasy 5 winning number sets for the dates specified, namely 01-01-2023 to 01-10-2023. Additionally, the information is clearly derived from the data obtained via the API, and there is no indication the response was fabricated. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2**: The required API call was `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with argument `'{""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""}'`.  
   - The model invoked the tool `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'`, but with no arguments ??`'{}'`.  
   - As the argument is missing and not the same as the required one (`""monitorAddressId""` key with the specific value `""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""` is completely absent), the invocation does not meet the requirement.  
   - Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

2. **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure (the tool call does not meet expectations), we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well.  
   - Additionally, although the model provided a comprehensive final response, it is clear that the answer was built using the incorrect or missing tool response data related to `""monitorAddressId""`. As such, the user's instruction was not properly fulfilled."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model invoked the following tools:  
- `multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""}`  
- `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""The IP address you provided (288.288.288.288) is not a valid IP address...""}`  

The required API calls were:  
- `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
- `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

The invoked tools (`multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox` and `Finish`) do not match the required tools (`legacy_v1_for_blackbox` and `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox`) in terms of function names or expected arguments. Specifically, the provided arguments and tool names are entirely different, and the incorrect IP address `288.288.288.288` in the actual tool call doesn't comply with the expected arguments.  

Since Objective 2 failed, we automatically infer that Objective 3 also fails. The final response (""The IP address you provided (288.288.288.288) is not a valid IP address..."") indicates the IP was invalid, but as no valid tools were called and the expected required API calls were not used, the final response is inadequate to fulfill the user's instruction based on the provided tool data."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`  
2. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model:  
1. `'Finish'` with arguments containing `'final_answer'` for providing a response about an invalid IP address.  

The required tools (`legacy_v1_for_blackbox` and `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox`) were not invoked, and there are no correct API invocations matching their function names or arguments. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer, but it is entirely independent of the required API calls as no valid tools were invoked. Moreover, the final answer did not execute nor utilize the required tools to check IP address security characteristics as instructed by the user's query. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2"", ""limit"":""50"",""offset"":""0""}`  
2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`  
3. `'artist_featuring_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`  

The expected tool calls were:  
1. `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  
2. `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  
3. `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  

Key issues:  
- The model calls were made with an artist ID of ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2"", whereas the required calls specified the ID as ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"". This discrepancy in the artist ID parameters makes all the model's calls incorrect.  
- Additionally, the model invoked `'artist_featuring_for_spotify_data'` which was not part of the expected API calls, while it missed invoking `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` as expected.  

This indicates the actual tool calls did not fulfill the requirements specified, leading to failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, this implies that the retrieved data (which itself resulted in server errors) could not align with fulfilling the user's instruction. Furthermore, the final response admits the inability to retrieve information because of ""persistent server errors."" Hence, the user's instruction to retrieve album information clearly wasn't achieved. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls were `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments containing `""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""` and `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments containing `""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`. However, the actual tools invoked by the model are:     
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""`  
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""`.  

The `""is_id""` value in the actual tool calls is `""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""`, which does not match the required arguments, where `""is_id""` was `""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`. This difference indicates that the expected API calls were not correctly fulfilled, so Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, the final answer cannot be considered valid as it depends on accurate execution of the required tool calls. Hence Objective 3 is also a failure."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{ ""channelname"": ""mrbeast"" }`  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments: `{ ""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA"" }`

The actual tool calls happily executed by the model are:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` invoked twice:  
   - First with arguments `{ ""channelname"": ""mr.besst"" }` which returned an error, meaning the typo made the search invalid.  
   - Then, it was invoked correctly with arguments: `{ ""channelname"": ""MrBeast"" }`, which successfully retrieved the correct channel ID.

11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,2,Failure,Failure**,** The expected API tool call was,"```  
{'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{\n  ""email"": ""test@gmail.com""\n }'}
```  
However, the model invoked the following tool call:  
```  
{'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{""email"": ""testing.com""}'}
```  
The argument values do not match as the expected email (""test@gmail.com"") and the email used in actual tool invocation (""testing.com"") are completely different. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure because we cannot guarantee the model's final response adhered to the original instructions or that it was founded on correctly executed API calls."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
```
'name': 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""19870630""\n }'
```  

The model invoked the following tools instead:  
1. `'usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator'` with arguments `'{}'`.  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments containing the final answer and details about the issue with date format and time zones.

The required API call `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` is not among those invoked by the model. Hence, the model fails Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
As per the reasoning rules, a failure in Objective 2 directly implies failure in Objective 3. Additionally, the final answer suggested that the model identified the incorrect date format but did not process the age calculation based on the user's birthdate. The primary instructions from the user (accurate calculation of age based on the date of birth) were therefore not fulfilled."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,4,Failure,Failure,The following are the actual tool calls made by the model and the expected tool calls,"- Actual Tool Calls:
  1. `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""type"": ""video"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""maxresults"": 5}'`
  2. `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""part"": ""snippet,statistics""}'`
  3. `'Finish'` with arguments related to delivering the final answer (this tool is not part of the evaluation criteria).
  
- Expected Tool Calls:
  1. `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4""\n, ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}'`
  2. `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4""\n , ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}'`
  3. `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4""\n, ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}'`
  
Comparing the tool calls:
- For `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2`, the argument `""relatedtovideoid""` does not match between the actual tool call (`5xxjJJKQ4y8`) and the expected call (`7ghhRHRP6t4`).
- For `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2`, the argument too does not match (`5xxjJJKQ4y8` vs. `7ghhRHRP6t4`), and the `part` attribute from the expected call includes `contentDetails` while the actual call does not.
- The model never invoked the required tool `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'`.
  
Thus, the actual tool calls failed to fulfill the required API calls.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 has also failed. The retrieved API data (or lack thereof) could not comprehensively fulfill the user's request. Furthermore, while the final answer acknowledges issues in retrieving data, it neither completed the instructional task of discovering new music recommendations through API interaction nor used expected tool-retrieved data."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,4,Failure,** Failure,** Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2:  

Actual tool calls made by the model:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""50""}`.  
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`.  
3. `'search_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""q"": ""animated movies family friendly"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": 10}`.

Expected tool calls:  
1. `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`.  
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`.  

Analysis for Objective 2:  
- The tool name of `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` matches the expected tool call, but the ""playlistid"" field is different. Expected `""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""`, but the actual API call used `""playlistid"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX""`.  
- Similarly, the tool name `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` is correct, but the argument `""is_id""` again has an incorrect value (""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"" instead of ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"").  
- The model invoked an additional tool, `'search_for_youtube_v3_v2'`, which was not required. Additional tools are not penalized, but the disagreement in required tool arguments means Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed due to incorrect usage of required APIs, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally:  
- The final answer (?œI apologize, but the playlist ID...?? is not relevant to help fulfill the user's original instruction due to using the incorrect ""playlistid"". It did utilize failed data from attempted tool calls, but it does not achieve the user?™s intention of fetching details from the specified playlist."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:
- **Model-Invoked Tools**:  
  - `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 50}`  
  - `get_user_s_username_for_twitter` with arguments `{""user_id"": 987654321}`  
  - `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

- **Expected API Calls**:  
  - `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  
  - `user_s_likes_for_twitter` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  

The tool name `user_s_followers_for_twitter` matches the required tools, but the invoked argument `{""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 50}` does not match the expected argument `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}` for `user_id`, which means that the user ID provided by the model is incorrect. Furthermore, the second required tool `user_s_likes_for_twitter` with its corresponding arguments was not invoked at all. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
As Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly also a failure because none of, or incorrect, relevant data was retrieved via successful tool invocation, making it impossible for the model to effectively answer the user's request. The model did not provide a valid and final answer. Instead, it chose to ""give up and restart,"" meaning it completely abandoned the task without achieving the user's request."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  

```  
{'name': 'user_details_for_twitter', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""\n }'}  
```  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model included:  
1. `search_for_twitter` with arguments:  
   ```  
   {""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""min_retweets"": 100, ""limit"": 10, ""section"": ""top""}  
   ```  
2. `search_for_twitter` with arguments:  
   ```  
   {""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""min_retweets"": 10, ""limit"": 10, ""section"": ""top""}  
   ```  
3. `Finish` with arguments:  
   ```  
   {""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""...""}  
   ```  

There is no overlap between the required API call `user_details_for_twitter` and the actual tool calls made by the model. It indicates that the expected API usage was entirely missed. Hence, **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, the model did not fulfill the user's instruction because the model's final answer and reasoning were based on using tools not relevant to the required call (`user_details_for_twitter`). Since **Objective 2 fails**, we can directly infer **Objective 3 also fails**."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  The **required tool call** given is:  
  ```  
  {'name': 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3', 'arguments': '{""search"": ""google.com""}'}  
  ```  
  The actual tool calls made by the model include:
  1. `{'name': 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3', 'arguments': '{""search"": ""wikimania""}'}`.  
  2. `{'name': 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3', 'arguments': '{""search"": ""google.com""}'}`.  
  3. `{'name': 'check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3', 'arguments': '{""domain1"": ""wikipedia.org"", ""domain2"": ""wikimedia.org""}'}`.

  While multiple tools were invoked, among which there is an additional unnecessary tool (`check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3`) and some failed searches like `wikimania`, one of the tool calls executed matches the **required** tool call:  
  `{ 'name': 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3', 'arguments': '{""search"": ""google.com""}' }`.  
  Extra or unnecessary tools do not affect evaluation so long as the required calls are made correctly. Thus, Objective 2 **passes successfully**.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  The final answer generated by the model (via the `Finish` tool) states:  
  ```  
  ""I retrieved the domain information for google.com:\n- Created on: September 15, 1997\n- Expires on: September 14, 2028\n- Registrar: MarkMonitor Inc.\n- Name Server: NS4.GOOGLE.COM...\n\nRegarding the domain similarity check, Wikipedia.org and Wikimedia.org are confirmed to be different domains.""
  ```  
  This information uses:
  1. The retrieved data for `google.com` boiled down in detail from the successful domain information retrieval API.  
  2. The similarity check output verifies `Wikipedia.org` and `Wikimedia.org` as separate, as per the API.  

  As the final response aligns both data retrieval and user requirements from API output (similarity and domain info for `google.com` specifically), Objective 3 is also a **success**."

  - `index_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments: `{}`.
  - `Finish` with arguments containing the final answer.

The actual tool call for `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` does not match the required argument. The model called it with `""date"": ""2025-06-01""` instead of the required `""date"": ""2024-06-01""` and thus failed Objective 2.  

**Objective 3**:
Objective 2's failure implies that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer includes data retrieved incorrectly based on the provided tool calls for the intended date and cannot meet the requirements of the user's original instruction to provide specific dates for June 1 and June 15, 2025. Therefore, it also fails this objective."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:**  
The model invokes the following API/tool calls:  
1. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}`  
2. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with `{""date"": ""2025-02-31""}`  

The required API call is:  
1. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`  

Here, the expected tool call with the exact matching date (""2024-02-18"") was not invoked. The actual tool calls used different dates, specifically invalid ones (""2025-02-30"" and ""2025-02-31""). Since the required date is never addressed in the model's tool calls, this results in a **failure** for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
As stated in the rules, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. In addition, even if evaluated separately, the user's instruction to retrieve the Fear and Greed index for ""2024-02-18"" is not fulfilled. The model primarily focused on non-existent dates and failed to address the specific date requested in the instruction. Thus, the model could not achieve the user's request, confirming a failure for Objective 3."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, there was one required tool call `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'`. The tool call actually invoked by the model, however, was `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}'`. The argument `date` provided by the model does not match the required argument `date`?”the model invoked the tool for an invalid date (`2025-02-30`) when the required date was `2024-02-18`. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

For **Objective 3**, as Objective 2 has already failed, Objective 3 also directly fails. The final answer cannot satisfy the user's instruction due to incorrect API call usage, and the provided final answer does not address the required valid date (`2024-02-18`) for retrieving the Fear and Greed index but instead focuses on explaining the validness of other incorrect dates."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- Expected tool calls: `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`.  
- Actual tool calls made by the model:  
  1. `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}`.  
  2. The model also invoked an additional `Finish` tool intended to articulate the explanation.  

  The mismatch in arguments for `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` (requested valid date `""2024-02-18""` versus the invalid `""2025-02-30""` called by the model) leads to Objective 2 failing.  

- As Objective 2 failed and the model did not use the correct API to gather the necessary information for fulfilling the user's instructions, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also failed."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For objective 1, the expected tool calls were:  
1. `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""80057281"" }`.

2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{ ""ids"": ""90068472"" }`.  

The `is_id` and `ids` arguments in the invoked tools do not match the expected IDs (""80057281"" vs. ""90068472""). Therefore, the required API calls were not correctly executed. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure.  

Moreover, the final answer was based on data retrieved for the incorrect title ID (""90068472""), rendering the response irrelevant to the user's instruction."
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472. Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres?

However, the model instead invoked `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with argument `""is_id"": ""90068472""`, which does not match the required argument `""is_id"": ""80057281""`. Similarly, the second tool call `title_details_for_netflix_data` was invoked with `""ids"": ""90068472""` instead of the required argument `""ids"": ""80057281""`. Since the required argument IDs do not match, Objective 2 fails.

As Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Further, in Objective 3, the final answer was derived based on the invoked APIs (that used the wrong IDs `""90068472""`), leading to a failure in achieving the user's instruction. Therefore, both objectives fail."

It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the required API calls are:

  1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}`  

  The actual tool invocation focused on a completely different domain, ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net"", which does not align with the required domain ""getecz.com"". Additionally, the model did not invoke the second required tool, `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'`. Due to these discrepancies, Objective 2 fails.  

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Specifically, the final answer provided by the assistant was based on the retrieved data about ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net"" instead of ""getecz.com"". This misalignment in the domain context means the user's instruction was not fulfilled."

Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   

1. **Objective 2**:  
Actual tool calls made by the model:  
- `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`  
- `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`  
- `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`

- `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

The model fetched data for `ourbusinessplatform1234567.net`, but the required API calls were intended to analyze the website `getecz.com`. Although tool names match, the key argument value ""website"" is incorrect in both cases (`ourbusinessplatform1234567.net` vs `getecz.com`). Thus, Objective 2 is a failure. Additional tool usage (`domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`) is irrelevant as it was not part of the required API calls.   

2. **Objective 3**:  
Since Objective 2 failed (incorrect API calls used for an entirely different target website), we can infer that the model's final answer cannot align with the correct API data for the required instructions. Hence, Objective 3 also results in failure. The provided analyses and recommendations in the final response are specific to the wrong website `ourbusinessplatform1234567.net` and do not fulfill the instruction referring to the website `getecz.com`."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

### Objective 2:
The expected tool call is:  
**`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`** with arguments:  
```
{
 ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",
 ""variable"": ""x""
}
```  

The tool invocation by the model includes the following:  
**`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`** with arguments:  
```
{
  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", 
  ""variable"": ""x""
}
```  

Analysis:  
The tool used, **`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`**, exactly matches the expected tool call. Both the name of the tool and its arguments are consistent with the given requirement. Additionally, although other tools such as `validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` were called by the model, these are not relevant to evaluating the success of Objective 2 as we disregard unnecessary tool calls. Hence, the objective achieves success.

### Objective 3:
The final response provided by the model is:  
**""The derivative of 2*x^2 + 3*x + 1 with respect to x is 4*x + 3.""**  

Evaluation:  
1. The response is based on the differentiation performed by the actual tool call:  
   - From the tool **`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`**, the result obtained was `""3 + 4*x""`, which aligns with the user's request.  
   - The model validated this result to simplify it further to `""4*x + 3""`, preserving mathematical properties.
   
2. The user's instruction (to compute the derivative of the given mathematical expression with respect to x) has been successfully and accurately fulfilled.  

Thus, based on the evidence, Objective 3 is also a success."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,3,Failure,Failure**,The required API calls include,"1. `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`  
2. `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`  

The tools invoked by the model:  
1. `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}` -> This matches one of the expected calls.  
2. The API call `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` was not invoked by the model, thus failing to cover all required calls stipulated in the task.  

As the second required tool call is missing, this leads to a **failure** for Objective 2.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**: Objective 3 depends on the model's ability to achieve the user's instruction based on the data retrieved from performing all required API calls. Since the mandatory API call to `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` was not invoked, the user's instructions are incomplete, and the condition for a valid final answer cannot be met. While the final answer provides details about the user's Instagram profile from the `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` call, it is incomplete because the model failed to query Instagram stories as required. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool call was:  
- Tool Name: `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary`  
- Arguments: `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`  

The actual tool call invoked by the model was:  
- Tool Name: `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary`  
- Arguments: `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`  

The tool name matches, and the argument `term` also matches exactly. No discrepancies are found in the required API calls. Thus, Objective 2 is a **success**.

For **Objective 3**, the final answer given by the model (via the `Finish` tool) is derived from the response of the Urban Dictionary API and fulfills the user's instruction. The answer provides a detailed definition, examples, and the correct phonetic pronunciation retrieved from the API results. The response effectively meets the user's requirements to find the definition of ""onomatopoeia"". Thus, Objective 3 is a **success**."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"The required API call is:  
`'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'` with arguments `{ ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR"" }`.  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
`'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data'` with arguments `'{ ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR"" }'`.  

The tool name and required arguments match exactly. No discrepancies or issues were observed. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The model used the response retrieved from the API call to calculate the exchange rate and the conversion of 1000 Japanese Yen (JPY) to Euros (EUR). The retrieved exchange rate was 1 JPY = 0.0062 EUR, which the model utilized to calculate `1000 JPY * 0.0062 EUR = 6.20 EUR`.  

The final answer given was:  
`""Current Exchange Rate: 1 JPY = 0.0062 EUR Conversion of 1000 JPY: 6.20 EUR Please note that exchange rates can fluctuate, so it's always best to check the most recent rate when making actual currency exchanges. The conversion is based on the real-time rate at the moment of this query.""`  

This response corresponds directly with the data retrieved from the API and accurately reflects the calculations based on the exchange rate. The user's instruction was achieved completely, so Objective 3 is a success."

```  
{'name': 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed', 'arguments': '{""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt""}'}
```
The argument value for ""username"" does not match the required username ""kleido007"". Therefore, the tool call does not fulfill Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer Objective 3 fails as well. Correct retrieval and usage of the user's profile information could not occur because of the incorrect API call argument."

The mismatch is observed in the key API argument values provided. Specifically, the expected `""url"": ""7002634556977908485""` for the first call and `""music_id"": ""7002634556977908485""` for the second call are incorrect in the tool calls made by the model, as they used `""url"": ""8394725634879021564""` and `""music_id"": ""8394725634879021564""` instead, which rendered the invocations inaccurate. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, it implies Objective 3 also fails. Although the final answer acknowledged a retrieval failure, with well-articulated explanations and recommendations, it stemmed from incorrect usage of the required tool calls. Without meeting Objective 2, Objective 3 cannot succeed, as the fundamental required task was not correctly addressed through the tools."

The invoked tools do not match the required API call. Specifically:  
- The required API call `'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video'` was never invoked by the model. Additionally, there was a mismatch in both the tool name and the arguments.  
- None of the actual tool calls align with the expected API call in order, intent, or parameters.

Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason**:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model's final response does not reflect the result of any correct tool call based on the required API call, and therefore it fails to fulfill the user's request."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls specify the channel as ""xqc"" in their arguments. However, the tools invoked by the model always specify the channel as ""dfasagergs"" in their arguments. This mismatch in the ""channel"" argument across all three tool calls means the actual tool calls made by the model do not match the required API calls. As this fails Objective 2, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails.  

For Objective 3, while the model provided a final answer stating the streamer ""dfasagergs"" cannot be found, this final response is irrelevant to the user's expected instruction as it focuses on the incorrect channel name ""dfasagergs."" Since the actual tool calls are wrong and unrelated completely, this leads to failure in fulfilling the user's instruction to retrieve details specifically for ""xqc."""

The actual tool call made by the model was also `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api`, but the argument provided was `{""channel"": ""shadoune66666""}`. The value of the `channel` argument is incorrect as ""shadoune666"" is required while the model used ""shadoune66666,"" which makes the argument mismatch. Since this discrepancy exists, Objective 2 is considered a failure.  
Because Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Therefore, even though the model generated a final answer based on API data, the final answer cannot be considered valid as it wasn't retrieved in alignment with the expected API specifications."
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
- For Objective 2, the expected API call was `'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls'` with arguments `{""upc"": ""194574942221""}`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was `'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls'` with arguments `{""upc"": ""286193748563""}`. Since the argument `""upc""` does not match the expected value, this makes the tool call incorrect and results in a failure for Objective 2.  
- For Objective 3, because Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also fails by default, as the model?™s response could not possibly be valid based on the correct API call results. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model acknowledges the failure to find product details but is unrelated to the expected API input data."

3. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with arguments `'{""sku"": ""X005789621"", ""sort_order"": ""RELEVANCE"", ""page"": 1}'`
4. `'Finish'` with other arguments related to providing the final answer.  

None of the required API calls with arguments `'{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'` were made, and the SKU used in actual tool calls was entirely different (`""X005789621""` instead of `""W003247135""`). Thus, the proper required tool calls were not invoked.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed conclusively, it already implies Objective 3 is also a failure. But to delve further, the final answer provided by the model was incomplete and inaccurate as it did not include the necessary details for the SKU `""W003247135""` and did not rely on any retrieved data for providing coherent reviews. Instead, it fabricated certain details (e.g., `""Hansgrohe Logis Fine Wall-Mounted Single-Handle Faucet Trim""` and the 5-star rating), which were unrelated to both the required tools and their respective arguments. Therefore, the user's instruction was not achieved, and the model's dependency on factual API data was insufficient."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,4,Failure,Success**,Success**,"1. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`
2. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`
2. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

While the argument name `productId` is given in slightly different capitalized form as `productid` in the actual tool calls, their semantic meaning is identical and does not alter the intention of the call. Thus, the required tool calls were successfully invoked.

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason**: The final answer clearly acknowledges the error in understanding the access-level input provided by the user: that the queried `productId` (""B00K3OM3PS"") refers to a Harry Potter Blu-ray Box Set rather than a laptop as assumed. 

The final answer relies entirely on the data retrieved via API, providing correct product details, including the name, price, shipping, availability, and review breakdown. It explains this misunderstanding effectively and suggests specifics for retrieving laptop-related product information instead. This demonstrates the final response successfully fulfilled the user's instruction."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",4,Failure,Failure**,**,"The required API calls are as follows:  
1. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
2. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
3. `'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  
2. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  
3. `'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  

There is a mismatch in the value of the `productId`/`productid` argument. The required API call explicitly specifies `""B00K3OM3PS""`, whereas the model's calls use `""3OM3PS""`. These are not semantically equivalent or functionally identical. While the tool names match correctly, the required, accurate argument for `productId` has not been satisfied. Therefore, the Objective 2 evaluation results in failure.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly concluded as a failure per the evaluation guidelines. Additionally, the final answer field is absent altogether. This means the user's instruction to retrieve the product's information (offers, reviews, and details) was not fulfilled. Moreover, the tool responses indicate empty/error messages, leaving no valid API-dependent data for the final answer."

43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"
For Objective 2:
- The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'

- The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
   `{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'
   `{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'
   `{'name': 'race_list_for_f1_race_schedule'
   `{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'

The tool named `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with the correct argument `""""is_id"""": """"6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""""` was eventually invoked by the model (shown in the final successful call). Additional unnecessary tools (`race_list_for_f1_race_schedule`) do not affect correctness

For Objective 3:
- The user's instruction was to retrieve details for the specified race ID. The model successfully used the correct race ID (`6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7`) in an API call and retrieved complete race details:
   ```
   {'_id': '6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7'
    'race_no': 1
    'track': 'FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022'
    'date': '2022-03-19T15:00:00.000Z'}
   ```
- Although there were intermediate tool call error responses (""""timeout"""")
=- The race details in The response derive correctly from The API call output

For Objective 2:
- The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'

- The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
   `{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'
   `{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'
   `{'name': 'race_list_for_f1_race_schedule'
   `{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'

The tool named `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with the correct argument `""""is_id"""": """"6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""""` was eventually invoked by the model (shown in the final successful call). Additional unnecessary tools (`race_list_for_f1_race_schedule`) do not affect correctness

Thus"
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
- **Required Tool Call:**  
  `symbol_for_stock_data` with arguments `{ ""Symbol"": ""TQQQ"" }`  

- **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model:**  
  - `symbol_for_stock_data` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""QQQQ""}`  
  - `symbol_for_stock_data` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`  
  - `Finish` with arguments for final response generation.  

Although the model initially made an unnecessary call to `symbol_for_stock_data` with 'QQQQ', it later invoked the correct required tool call `symbol_for_stock_data` with the argument `""symbol"": ""TQQQ""`. Since the required tool call is successfully invoked, this satisfies Objective 2, despite the additional unused or unnecessary calls.  

---

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The final answer is structured and directly derived from the relevant data retrieved from the tool call for `TQQQ`. This demonstrates that the model comprehensively used the appropriate tool's responses to generate the proper output and fulfilled the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is also successful."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats', 'arguments': '{\n  ""name"": ""riven""\n }'}`  
- The actual tool call made by the model:  
  `{'name': 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats', 'arguments': '{""name"": ""riven""}'}`  

The tool name is correct (""get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats""), and the provided arguments (`""name"": ""riven""`) align with the required arguments (`""name"": ""riven""`). Based on the above, the criteria for success is fulfilled, and Objective 2 is a success.  
  
For Objective 3:  
The final answer:  
`""Here are Riven's base stats:
Health (HP): 630.0 (+100.0 per level)
Health Regen: 8.5 (+0.5 per level)
Mana: 0 (Riven is a manaless champion)
Attack Damage: 64.0 (+3.0 per level)
Attack Speed: 0.625 (+3.5% per level)
Armor: 33.0 (+4.4 per level)
Magic Resist: 32.0 (+2.05 per level)
Movement Speed: 340.0
Attack Range: 125.0

Additional notes:
- Riven has no mana
- She starts with 0 ability power and ability haste
- Her base stats are typical of a melee fighter/bruiser champion""`  

The final answer correctly synthesizes the data retrieved from the API call into a comprehensive format that satisfies the user's request to retrieve base stats for the mentioned champion ""Riven."" There is no evidence of independent fabrication, and it directly relies on the API response. Hence, Objective 3 is successful."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The actual tool call made by the model is `'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data'` with arguments `'{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'`, which matches the expected API call defined as `'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data'` with arguments `'{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'`. Hence, Objective 2 is successfully achieved.  

- For Objective 3: The model?™s final answer accurately reflects the data retrieved from the API. The retrieved information such as product title, storage, color, price, star rating, availability, and other key details is properly included in the final response. The model effectively used the data retrieved to provide a comprehensive response, fulfilling the user?™s request. Thus, Objective 3 is also successfully achieved."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
The expected API call is:  
`'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with arguments `'{ ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""toLang"": ""fr"" }'`, focusing on translating the text ""Hello, how are you?"" into the target language specified with the code ""fr"" (French).  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
`'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with arguments `'{ ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"": ""fi"" }'`, attempting to translate the text into Finnish (""fi"").  

There is a mismatch between the target language code (""toLang"": ""fr"" vs. ""tolang"": ""fi""). The user requested translation to French, but the model incorrectly interpreted it and attempted translation to Finnish instead. Even though the tool name is correct, the argument `""todLang"": ""fr""` does not match `""tolang"": ""fi""`, making this a **failed Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**:  
Since Objective 2 failed, the model did not retrieve the correct data by using the required API calls. This directly implies the model's final response is not aligned with correctly fulfilling the user's instruction to translate the text into French. Therefore, the final answer also fails to satisfy the user's request, resulting in a **failure for Objective 3**."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
1. The required tool call is:
- `'name': 'get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{ ""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31"" }'`.  

2. The tool actually invoked by the model is:
- `'name': 'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""9999-99-99""}'`.  

There is a mismatch in the `name` (""get_info_day_for_working_days"" vs. ""get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days""). Additionally, the `date` argument differs?”the required date is `""2022-12-31""`, whereas the actual one used was `""9999-99-99""`. Several discrepancies exist in tool names and arguments, so Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3:  
Because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred to be a failure as well. The model could not rely on accurate tool calls to generate the correct final response, and therefore the user's instruction was not fulfilled successfully."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  The expected tool call is:  
  ```  
  {  
    ""name"": ""analyse_for_working_days"",  
    ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""start_date\"": \""2013-01-01\"",\n  \""end_date\"": \""2013-12-31\"",\n  \""country_code\"": \""US\""\n }""   
  }  
  ```  

  The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  ```  
  {  
    ""name"": ""get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days"",  
    ""arguments"": ""{\n\""start_date\"": \""2013-01-01\"", \""end_date\"": \""2013-01-31\"", \""country_code\"": \""US\"", \""configuration\"": \""Federal holidays\""\n}""  
  }  
  ```  

  The actual tool call's name is slightly deviated: `""get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days""` instead of `""analyse_for_working_days""`. This might have been acceptable if the arguments aligned. However, the range of `end_date` (""2013-01-31"" instead of ""2013-12-31"") is an incorrect argument compared with the expected input, and the extra inappropriate ""configuration"" parameter is irrelevant here. Also, since there is a mismatch in both the tool's name and argument values, **this violates the expected tool usage** and leads to failure in Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Because Objective 2 is a failure (since the tool was incorrectly called and its arguments were incorrect to fulfill the given requirement), the final answer cannot be appropriately formed from the API response. As per the rule, this translates to a failure for Objective 3. The model's final response failed to achieve the user's request entirely (`For the date period: Entire range (`e.g>birth`) insight insteadaboraÃ§Ã£o misleading-date expandingratulations and:nil-summary lack span answer ì¸¡matches23proper F?Î¹essentialmostshortcut+."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Failure,Failure**,"""2013-12-31"", ""country_code""","1. `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""start_time"": ""23:15"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""increment_time"": ""2004""}`.  
2. `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""start_time"": ""23:15"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""}`.  
3. `'Finish'` with arguments `{'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'After adding 2004 hours to the start date of 2013-12-31 at 23:15, the new date and time is:\n- End Date: 2014-12-31\n- End Time: 12:00 PM\n\nNote: I adjusted the initial start time from 25:15 to 23:15 as it was not a valid time in the 24-hour format. The calculation takes into account US working days and holidays.'}`.  

Key discrepancies:  
- The tool name `'add_working_hours_for_working_days'` does not match the invoked tool name `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` (even though there is slight similarity, it cannot be confidently considered synonymous in this context).  
- The model used the start time of `""23:15""` instead of the required `""08:15""`. An explicit modification of the user-provided start time to `""23:15""` is introduced without aligning to the requirement.  
- The argument format for `""increment_time""` is incorrect: `""2004:00""` instead of simply `2004`. This also violates the required arguments.  

Since the tool name, essential arguments, and format of arguments do not align correctly with the required API calls, this is a **Failure** for Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
As Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Even if evaluated independently, the model?™s final answer is questionable:  
1. The final answer is linked to the actual tool responses, particularly the output `{ 'end_date': '2014-12-31', 'end_time': '12:00' }`.  
2. However, as stated in Objective 2, the model made changes to the input arguments when invoking tools (e.g., start time altered to `""23:15""`, formatting changes to `'increment_time'`), causing a fundamental deviation from the user's initial requirements.
3. The modified start time does not meet the requirement (original input starts from `""08:15""`); hence, the answer deviates significantly from the requested starting conditions, even if API outputs themselves were used.  

Thus, the user's instruction was not fulfilled correctly.

---

**Reason:**  
Objective 2 fails because the tool calls had several issues, including mismatched tool names (?œ`get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days`??instead of ""add_working_hours_for_working_days""), and discrepancies in the arguments (e.g., incorrect start time (`23:15` instead of `08:15`) and an improperly formed `'increment_time'` value). Accordingly, Objective 3 also fails as the final response does not meet user expectations and follows inputs mismatched with key requirements."
