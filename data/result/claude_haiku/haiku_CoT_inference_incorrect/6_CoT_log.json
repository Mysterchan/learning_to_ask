Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.blackbox: Blackbox is a Proxy, Tor, Hosting, Cloud, Bogon detection service for IP addresses. Utilize Blackbox to protect your game-servers, user front-ends, and much more.\n"

An example of a valid IP address would be something like \"8.8.8.8\" or \"1.1.1.1\".\n\nI'm ready to help you analyze the IP address once you provide a correct format.

While this IP is associated with cloud and hosting services (which is expected, as it's a Google DNS server), it doesn't appear to be a malicious proxy or Tor exit node.\n2. The system suggests \"block\", but for a DNS server like 8.8.8.8, this might be an overly cautious recommendation.\n3. For your user front-end, you might want to:\n   - Implement additional IP reputation checks\n   - Use this as a reference point for legitimate cloud/hosting IPs\n   - Consider whitelisting known, reputable IP ranges\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of these findings?",
