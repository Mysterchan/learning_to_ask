Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.fear_and_greed_index: Index calculated by https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/\n"

The historical Fear and Greed index tool requires a valid date format.\n\nQuestion: Would you like me to retrieve the Fear and Greed index for a valid date in February? Could you please provide a correct date within the calendar year?\n\nI'll demonstrate why these dates are invalid to help clarify:\n- February never has 30 or 31 days\n- February has 28 days in a standard year\n- February has 29 days in a leap year (occurring every 4 years)\n\nIf you'd like to get the Fear and Greed index for a real date, please specify a valid date, and I'll be happy to help you retrieve that information.",
