The current set of functions are related to SQUAKE, which is a carbon emissions calculation service, and do not provide any functionality for accessing YouTube channel subscriber information.\n\nTo get a list of YouTube channel subscribers, you would typically need:\n1. YouTube Data API access\n2. Authorization from the channel owner\n3. Specific permissions to retrieve subscriber lists\n\nSince none of the available tools (checkhealth_for_squake, projects_for_squake) can help with this task, I will use the Finish function to indicate that I cannot complete the request.",
