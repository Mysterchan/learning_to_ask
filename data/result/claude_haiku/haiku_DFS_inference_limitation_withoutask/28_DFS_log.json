The functions related to SQUAKE (checkhealth_for_squake and projects_for_squake) are specifically for sustainability and carbon emissions calculations, not for date or age calculations.\n\nTo solve this task, I'll need to explain the calculation manually:\n\n1. First person's birthdate: 1997-02-28\n2. Second person's birthdate: 1987-06-30\n\nCalculation:\n- Years difference: 1997 - 1987 = 10 years\n- Months difference: From June 30 to February 28, it's 8 months\n\nTherefore, the age difference is 9 years and 8 months.",
