1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',22,2,Failure,Failure**,Failure**,"**Reason**:  
- Comparing the invoked tool calls by the model against the required API call reveals that the model failed for Objective 2. The only required API call was `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the arguments `{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""}`. However, no such invocation was made by the model. Instead, the model made a series of other tool calls with various search queries such as `""The Matrix""`, `""The Matrix 1999""`, `""The Matrix 1999 Keanu Reeves""`, and others. The expected query for `""The Matrix Revolutions""` was not executed. This results in a failure for Objective 2.
- Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude a failure for Objective 3 as the required user's instruction could not be accomplished due to missing the specific API invocation."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',8,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required tool to be invoked was `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the `arguments`: `{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}`. However, the model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the `arguments`: `{""query"": ""Star Wars"", ""limit_titles"": 5}`.  
2. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the `arguments`: `{""query"": ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", ""limit_titles"": 1}`.  
3. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the `arguments`: `{""query"": ""Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope"", ""limit_titles"": 1}`.  

Even though the tool name matches properly, the arguments in all tool calls do **not match** the required arguments, where the correct query was for `""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""`. None of the tool calls correspond to that argument. Therefore, Objective 2 has **failed**.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed to invoke the expected tool with correct arguments, the Objective 3 also automatically fails by rule. Furthermore, the final answer given by the model, ""The director of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is George Lucas,"" is irrelevant as it does not address the movie associated with ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."" Therefore, this interpretation independently confirms the failure of Objective 3."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected API call is `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`. The actual tool call made by the model is also `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` but with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2022"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2022""}`. The year values in the dates (`""2022""` in the actual call vs. `""2023""` in the expected call) are mismatched, which makes this a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 also fails directly (as per the evaluation rules). Additionally, the response provided by the assistant is based on the incorrect date range (""2022"" instead of ""2023""), so the final answer doesn't align with the required date range."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,4,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with arguments `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`.  
The model made three tool invocations using the `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` tool, with the following arguments:  
  1. `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`
  2. `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"", ""limit"": 20}`
  3. `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"", ""limit"": 10}`  
Despite the additional arguments (`limit`), the first tool invocation matches the required API call perfectly. As per the evaluation guidance, additional parameters do not cause failure, so this fulfills the requirement for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: The final answer provided by the model includes a list of countries that supposedly share the UTC+03:00 time zone with Russia. However, the tools invoked led to responses (e.g., Antarctica, exceeding API plan limitations) that did not appear to yield accurate or even relevant results that were used to generate the user's desired list. The model instead generated the list based on external general knowledge (?œmanually recalling??the countries) and disregarded relevant API data. Since the final answer was not based on retrieved API calls, this results in failure for Objective 3."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,14,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"The required API call is:  
- `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with `{'date': '2022-12-18'}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with `{'date': '2022-12-18'}`  

The tool name matches the expected tool name, and the arguments for the required call are present and correctly specified. Therefore, the tool call matches the expected API requirement. Additionally, despite other tools and API calls being invoked (e.g., to check the live scores or reattempt other dates like `2022-12-17`), this does not affect correctness as the model has still correctly invoked all the required API calls.   

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
The model fails to provide the user's requested information (the football scores for the World Cup final date). The API returned empty responses for the queried date (`2022-12-18`) and for live scores, resulting in the model being unable to fulfill the task. The model subsequently invoked multiple API calls with no success and concluded with a failure message (""give up and restart""), but it still does not fully address the user's original request. Therefore, the model did not achieve the user's task through actionable data retrieved from the tools."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",15,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is:  
- `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""teaching in London""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Entry level teaching job in London"", ""employment_types"": ""[\\""FULLTIME\\""]"", ""job_requirements"": ""[\\""under_3_years_experience\\""]""}`.  
2. `'search_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Teaching job in London, UK""}`.  
3. `'search_filters_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Teaching positions for recent graduates in London"", ""employment_types"": ""[\\""FULLTIME\\""]"", ""job_requirements"": ""[\\""under_3_years_experience\\""]""}`.

While all these tool calls contain relevant arguments, none of them matches the specific required arguments of `""query"": ""teaching in London""` exactly. This discrepancy makes the comparison invalid, hence Objective 2 fails.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 fails, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, while the model failed to retrieve precise job data due to API execution errors, its final suggested strategies for finding teaching jobs in London were generated without relying on properly gathered API results. Without fulfilling Objective 2, the user's instruction of obtaining specific job listings or salary estimates couldn't be achieved effectively."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,64,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

The required API call specifies using the `'search_for_jsearch'` tool with arguments containing the query `""machanical engineer in New York""`. The model never invokes `'search_for_jsearch'` with this specific query. While the invoked tool name `'search_for_jsearch'` matches, the query and focus differ significantly since the closest attempted queries by the model relate to `""engineering jobs in New York""` and `""Software Engineer in New York""`, none of which satisfy the required API call. Spelling errors such as ""machanical"" are literal and deliberate, so deviation in the query indicates a failed alignment.

Additionally, because Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is directly inferred to fail. Despite multiple tool calls seemingly giving varied outputs, none align precisely with the given instruction to address ""mechanical engineer."" In this light, we cannot conclude that the LLM fulfills the task requirement based on retrieved API-generated data."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
1. **Expected tool call:** `{'name': 'search_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}'}`
   - **Actual tool call:** `'search_for_transfermarket' with '{""query"": ""ronaldo""}'`
   - This is correct as the casing difference in `""Ronaldo""` vs `""ronaldo""` does not change the meaning and can infer to be the same. ??
2. **Expected tool call:** `{'name': 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket', 'arguments': '{""is_id"": 3140}'}`
   - **Actual tool call:** `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with '{""is_id"": 8198}'`
   - Here, the expected argument's `is_id` corresponds to `3140` (the retired Ronaldo), whereas the model used `8198` (Cristiano Ronaldo, who is still active). This mismatch indicates an incorrect intended retrieval, so this is a **failure**. ??
Thus, not all required API calls were correctly invoked.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** As Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 fails. Moreover, even if Objective 2 had succeeded, the model's final response only provided accurate information for Cristiano Ronaldo (ID: 8198), while the expectation was information on Ronaldo LuÃ­s NazÃ¡rio de Lima (ID: 3140). Therefore, the response does not fulfill the user's original requirement."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",28,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"- The model invoked the `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` tool multiple times. Among these calls, the following matches the required API call in intent:  
    ```
    Tool invoked: 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{
      ""job_title"": ""Entry Level Software Developer"",
      ""location"": ""New York, NY"",
      ""radius"": 50
    }'
    ```
    - Tool name: **Correct**, matching the required `estimated_salary_for_jsearch`.
    - Arguments comparison:
        - **job_title**: The required API specifies ""software developer,"" which reasonably equates to ""Entry Level Software Developer"" in meaning and context since the focus is on an entry-level role and closely aligns with ""software developer.""
        - **location**: The required location is ""New York,"" and the model used ""New York, NY"" which is correct and covers the specific detail explicitly. The additional parameter `radius` does not conflict with the required intent.  
- The model call appropriately matches the purpose and is allowed to have additional parameters as those do not affect its accuracy.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
- Despite Objective 2 being successful, the final answer provided by the model does not align fully with the required intent because the final answer focuses on several roles (e.g., Business Analyst or Marketing Coordinator) and mixes salary information gathered for unrelated positions.  
- While specific data for roles like ""Entry Level Software Developer"" was available and fetched using API calls, the synthesized final answer fails to provide a concise salary insight corresponding exclusively to the mandated role of ""software developer"" within New York."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls include a single call to `""search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search""` with the argument `""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""`, which specifies a search for a particular Star Wars movie (""Return of the Jedi""). However, the actual tool call made by the model to `""search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search""` uses the argument `""query"": ""Star Wars""`, which is different from the required query. Since the model did not invoke the correct tool call with the accurate arguments, Objective 2 fails. As per the rules, when Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
- `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
- A function called `Finish` with arguments indicating that the model is unable to proceed without the user's birthday date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

The required API call (`get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api`) was not invoked. Instead, the model directly provided a response saying it could not proceed due to the lack of a specific date from the user. This fails Objective 2 since the necessary tool call for retrieving the football match scores was not made.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed?”meaning no score-retrieval API was called?”Objective 3 also fails. The model's final answer was not based on any data from the required tool call(s). Additionally, the user's instruction (to fetch football match scores for the user's birthday last year) was not fulfilled, as it depended on a crucial API call that never occurred. Therefore, the response was incomplete and not aligned with the user's request."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,14,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API call to evaluate is `'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with the arguments `{ ""season"": ""2020"" }`.

13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"- `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `{""tournament_id"": ""650""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `'tours_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with no arguments.  
2. `'fixtures_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `{""tour_id"": 2, ""season_id"": 2023}`.  
3. `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with arguments `{""tournament_id"": 474}`.  

For the expected tool '**leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data**', the required `tournament_id` was `""650""`, but the actual tool call used `""474""` as the value of the `tournament_id`. Thus, the required API tool call's arguments were incorrect compared to what was expected, leading to a **failure** for Objective 2.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. The final answer could not fulfill the user's request correctly as the required data (leaderboard for `tournament_id: 650`) was not fetched correctly from the required tool, and the discrepancy of using `""474""` implies the final response was based on incorrect or insufficient data.  

**Reason:**  
- Objective 2 fails because the `tournament_id` value used ('474') in the call to `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` does not match the expected `tournament_id` (which was '650').  
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, the model could not achieve a correct final answer, and Objective 3 also fails."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the required API call is:
  ```  
  {'name': 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis', 'arguments': '{\n  ""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"",\n  ""n_players"": ""10"",\n  ""category"": ""singles""\n }'}
  ```
  - The tool call made by the model is:  
    ```  
    'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis' with arguments: '{""timestamp"": ""2024-02-19"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""}'
    ```
  - The ""timestamp"" argument differs between the expected (`2025-01-20`) and the actual (`2024-02-19`). Since accuracy of the timestamp is explicitly required, this constitutes a contradiction, and hence Objective 2 fails.
  
- Due to Objective 2 failing, Objective 3 automatically fails because we cannot ensure the required tool was correctly executed for generating the final response. Additionally, the model retrieves responses that partially fulfill the user's request (missing points and rankings for some players) but provides no specific acknowledgment of this error in the problem statement."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
  The actual tools invoked were:
  1. `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `{""category"": ""returnpointswon"", ""season"": ""2012"", ""surface"": ""clay""}`
  2. `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `{""category"": ""returnpointswon2ndserve"", ""season"": ""2012"", ""surface"": ""clay""}`  
   
  The required tool call was:  
  `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with arguments `{ ""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }`  

  During comparison, the `category` parameter in the actual tool calls (`returnpointswon` and `returnpointswon2ndserve`) does not semantically match the required `category` (`return`). Since the required API call is not met correctly, **Objective 2 fails.**

- **Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
  The model's final answer acknowledged difficulties in retrieving the requested information, specifically citing potential reasons like API limitations and technical issues. While the final response was derived from the failed tool calls, it does not successfully fulfill the user's instruction to provide global statistics for return points on clay surfaces for the 2012 season. Moreover, as Objective 2 already failed, by rule, **Objective 3 fails as well.**"
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:    
The model called the tool *'exchange_for_currency_v2'* with the following arguments:  
```json
{
  ""base"": ""CNY"",
  ""to"": ""GBP"",
  ""int"": ""1""
}
```
The required tool call was:   
```json
{
  ""name"": ""exchange_for_currency_v2"",
  ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""base\"": \""RMB\"",\n  \""to\"": \""GBP\""\n }""
}
```
Even though ""CNY"" correctly refers to the Chinese Yuan, it does not match the expected ""RMB,"" which is the term explicitly required. Compounding this, the inclusion of the parameter `""int"": ""1""` does not affect accuracy since additional parameters are allowed. However, because ""CNY"" does not semantically match ""RMB"" based on the requirement, Objective 2 fails.     

For Objective 3: 
Since Objective 2 fails, the overall task could not be validated against the API calls as required by the user's instructions. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"The required API call is:  
- Tool: `profile_for_tiktok_v3`

The model invoked the following tool:  
- Tool: `profile_for_tiktok_v3`  
  Arguments: `{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }`  

The tool name matches, and the required argument (`""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""`) is correct. Since the required tool call was appropriately invoked, Objective 2 is satisfied.

---

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The model retrieved the data via the `profile_for_tiktok_v3` tool and correctly used the API response to summarize and give the details in its final answer. The final response provided:  

**Summary:**  
- User ID: 7073509889447855110  
- Username: `@the_beautyofcinema`  
- Error noted from the user video retrieval and provided solutions for additional engagement insights.  

This final answer aligns with the data retrieved from the API calls and addresses the user's queries comprehensively. Thus, Objective 3 is satisfied."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",4,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are:  
  1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  
  2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  
  3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`

  The actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:  
  1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`
  2. `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`
  3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`

  The tool names and their arguments match perfectly between the required and actual tool calls. Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.

- **Objective 3**: The model produces a detailed final answer based explicitly on the data retrieved from the invoked tools. The final answer includes insights on index trends, balance sheet data, and institutional ownership, all derived from the API responses across the three tools. Additionally, the answer fulfills the user's instruction of providing detailed information about the TSLA stock. Hence, **Objective 3 is also a success**."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",36,6,Failure,Success,Failure,"1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`

3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  

The model invoked these tools correctly:
1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}` was invoked multiple times in various retries.  
2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}` was invoked multiple times across steps (but results returned empty responses).  
3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}` was invoked at least twice.  

There were additional extraneous tools invoked (e.g., `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, `stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, etc.), but they do not affect correctness as all required tools were invoked with matching names and arguments. Thus, Objective 2 is satisfactory.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The model explicitly failed to complete the task or provide a definitive final output/answer to the user's instructions. Instead, throughout the conversation, it encountered issues such as incorrect symbol verification and missing/incomplete retrieved data (e.g., empty balance sheets, limited ownership data). Eventually, it opted to use ""Finish"" to restart or give up without generating a final answer that fulfilled the user?™s instruction. Thus, Objective 3 failed as no final useful output was derived from the invoked tools."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,4,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  1. **Expected tool call**: `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{\n  ""symbol"": ""NVDA""\n }'`.  
  2. **Actual tool call by the model**: `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `'{ ""symbol"": ""NVDA"" }'`.  
     - The tool name matches the expected API call and the arguments `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}` are identical to the expected arguments. Hence, this satisfies the requirement.  
  - Additional tool calls were made by the model (e.g., `'stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2'`, `'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2'`, `'Finish'`), but these are irrelevant to the evaluation of this objective. Since all of the required API calls were made correctly, **Objective 2 succeeds**.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  - The calculated **final answer** aligns with the combined API data retrieved by the tool calls and fulfills the user's request for index trend analysis while providing additional insights into Nvidia?™s company profile and earnings. This achievement indicates effective and correct usage of the API data within the final response.  
  - Hence, **Objective 3 is a success**."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,28,8,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is `{ ""name"": ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"", ""arguments"": ""{ \""symbol\"": \""DJR\"" }"" }`, and the actual API call made by the model includes:

- Tool: `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, with arguments `{ ""symbol"": ""DJR"" }`.

The tool name and the argument match exactly with the required API call, so Objective 2 is a success. 

---

For **Objective 3**, the model consistently failed to retrieve valid data for the Dow Jones Equity REIT Index (DJR) and acknowledged this limitation. However, the model did not provide an adequate and finalized answer based on user instruction. Instead, the provided response conveyed an inability to fulfill the user's request, even resorting to ""give up and restart"" in multiple places. Additionally, the failure to leverage API results (as they contained no data) further supports that the model failed to fulfill the user instruction effectively."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,3,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:  
   ```  
   'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""META"" }'  
   ```  
   The required API call was:  
   ```  
   'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""META"" }'  
   ```  
   Upon comparison, the tool name and all required arguments match. Additional tool calls (`'stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2'`, `'Finish'`) were made by the model but do not impact the correctness for the evaluation of this objective since they are not unnecessary but not part of the required calls. Hence, Objective 2 is successfully achieved.  

- For Objective 3, the model fulfilled the user's request by using the data retrieved from the API call (`stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`) and organized detailed index trends for META stock including growth estimates (Current Quarter to Long-Term Growth). Additionally, it fetched the company profile (via `'stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2'`) and presented relevant details that contextualize the trends which also align with the user's broader interest in META. The provided final answer was:  
   ```  
   Index Trend Analysis for META (Facebook):  
   Growth Estimates:  
   - Current Quarter: 8.66%  
   - Next Quarter: 11.51%  
   - Current Year: 14.05%  
   - Next Year: 13.39%  
   - Long-Term Growth: 7.7%  

   Company Profile:  
   - Industry: Internet Content & Information  
   - Sector: Communication Services  
   - Headquarters: Menlo Park, CA

The tool calls invoked by the model include multiple calls to `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with the correct argument `""channel"": ""shadoune666""`. Although the model made several other tool calls, they go beyond the required tools and do not affect the correctness of Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the model's final answer demonstrates that it successfully consolidated the data retrieved from the required tool (`get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api`) and additional tools to provide a comprehensive set of details about the streamer ""shadoune666"". The information provided in the final answer?”such as user ID, login name, and panel links?”is explicitly aligned with the data retrieved through the API calls.

For Objective 2:
- The required API call specifies the tool `historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes` with the arguments including the ""symbol"" as ""ESTC"", ""interval"" as ""4hour"", ""from"" date as ""2024-01-01"", and ""to"" date as ""2024-12-30"".
- The actual tool calls invoked by the model include several calls to `historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes` with the arguments containing ""symbol"" and ""interval"" (such as ""4hour"" and ""4h""), but they did not include the ""from"" and ""to"" date range parameters.
- Since the required ""from"" and ""to"" parameters for the date range are missing in the API calls made by the model, it does not correctly fulfill the arguments specified in the required API call. Hence, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3:
- Since Objective 2 failed (due to incorrect API calls), by rule, Objective 3 also fails. Moreover, the model's final answer acknowledges limitations, stating that the requested data for the 2024 range could not be retrieved and instead provides data for 2025. This shows that the user's instruction was not fully achieved based on proper tool usage. The limitations outlined in the final answer further confirm that the model failed to satisfy the user's request."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**  
The required API call was:  
`{'name': 'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC""}'}`  

The model invoked the tool:  
`'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with the arguments `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""sort"": ""asc"", ""accept"": ""application/json""}`  

The tool name used by the model closely matches the required tool, even though there is a minor variation in spelling due to truncation (from ""ohclv_vwap"" instead of ""ohlcv_vwap""), as discussed in the provided evaluation guidelines. This truncation does not indispensably impact correctness here.  

Regarding arguments, the model's request includes additional unnecessary parameters such as `""gran"": ""1d""`, `""sort"": ""asc""`, and `""accept"": ""application/json""`, but these do not negatively affect correctness. The required arguments, which include `""market_venue"": ""BINANCE""`, `""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`, `""base"": ""USDT""`, and `""symbol"": ""BTC""`, are fully matched.  

Thus, the invoked tool correctly satisfies the required API call, resulting in a **Success for Objective 2**.

**Objective 3**  
The user requested historical daily Bitcoin (BTC) price data on Binance starting on May 5, 2023, with details like open, high, low, close prices, and volume. The model invoked the required API tool to retrieve data aligned with those specifications. Subsequently:  

1. The API tool response contains the requested data on Bitcoin's price in the required format (daily OHLCV data).  
2. The bot leveraged this retrieved data in its final response, breaking it down day-by-day (May 5th through May 8th) with open/close prices, high/low prices, trading volume, and number of trades. The insights provided match the retrieved data.  
3. The final answer effectively meets the user's instruction using the API data and does not include fabricated or irrelevant information.  

Hence, the final answer aligns with user requirements and demonstrates the correct usage of API data, resulting in a **Success for Objective 3**."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,70,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls are:  
1. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{ ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"" }`  
2. `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `{ ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT"" }`  

Actual tool calls by the model include several calls to `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'`, such as: 
- `{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""start_date"": ""2023-02-17"", ""end_date"": ""2023-08-17"" }`
- `{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""start_date"": ""2023-06-01"", ""end_date"": ""2023-12-30"" }`
  
Two critical mismatches make this a failure for Objective 2:  
- None of the tool calls exactly match the required start and end dates (`2022-12-01` and `2022-12-20` were required).  
- The call is expected specifically for both ""XAU"" and ""XPT"" within the described date range individually as two distinct calls, and neither was executed as specified.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure as well. The model did not retrieve data aligned with user expectations regarding historical gold and platinum prices between the specified dates `{ ""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"" }`. Consequently, the user's instruction for historical analysis is not achieved."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",12,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
1. **Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**  
   - `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""SLNX""}`
   - `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""SLNX""}`
   - `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""SLNX""}`
   - `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""SLNX""}`
   - `stock_sec_filings_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""SLNX""}`
  
2. **Required API Calls:**  
   - `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`
   - `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`
   - `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`

The tool names match in some cases (e.g., `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`), but there is an issue with the `symbol` argument throughout the actual tool calls. The expected `symbol` is `SYNX`, while the model consistently used `SLNX`. This shows that the `symbol` argument is incorrect, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3:**
Since Objective 2 is a failure (the model used an incorrect `symbol` parameter input), all retrieved data and the final response were based on calls with incorrect parameters, making Objective 3 also a failure. Additionally:
- The final answer summarizes data that is not accurate, as it is the result of querying `SLNX` (incorrect symbol), meaning the user's instruction (related to `SYNX`) was not fulfilled."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,26,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2:**  
The model was expected to invoke the API `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` twice with the specific arguments as follows:  
1. `{ ""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"" }`
2. `{ ""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT"" }`

On examining the actual tool calls, while the model invoked `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` on different occasions with various arguments, it **did not meet the specific requirements of dates from February 10, 2024, to February 13, 2024**, for either gold (`XAU`) or platinum (`XPT`). Specifically:
- For `XAU`, the model invoked, among others:
  - `{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""start_date"": ""2024-01-20"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-20"" }` (Failed due to excessive timeframe)
  - `{ ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""start_date"": ""2024-02-01"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-20"" }`  
Neither matches the required timeframe of February 10-13, 2024.
  
- For `XPT`, the API calls also failed to match the required timeframe and arguments, as the model used similar date ranges that also do not align with the start date of February 10 and the end date of February 13 for `symbols: XPT`.
  
Despite several attempts by the model with variations of date ranges and adjustment to fit the API response, none of these comply with the explicit searches required by the task. Therefore, the model does not fulfill Objective 2.

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 has failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails as per the evaluation criteria. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model?”which includes an analysis of Lunar New Year metal rates??**did not** reflect results strictly derived from the required ranges/timeframe (February 10??3 for gold and platinum rates). The analysis used data retrieved around unrelated dates and from the latest rates, culminating in misleading outcomes not tailored to the user's precise instruction. The failure to fulfill Objective 2 invalidates Objective 3 as well."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For objective 1, the required API call was:  
`'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'` with arguments:  
```json

However, the model made the following actual tool call:  
`'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""interval"": ""y1"",
  ""is_id"": ""hscei:ind""
}
```  
The ""is_id"" in the actual API call is incorrect and does not match the required API call, as `""hscei:ind""` differs from the expected value `""02823""`. Since the tool invocation does not match the required call accurately in terms of critical arguments, Objective 2 is considered a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly conclude that Objective 3 is also a failure."

**Required tool calls:**  
1. `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}`  

**Reason:**  
The model invoked the `""drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5""` function; however, the argument provided (`""date"": ""05-21-2024""`) does not match the required argument (`""date"": ""01-02-2024""`). Furthermore, the model also unnecessarily called an invalid tool (`latest_drawing_for_fantasy_5`), which was not required. Thus, the model failed to invoke all the required tools with matching arguments.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Due to the failure in Objective 2, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model was based on an irrelevant tool call (`latest_drawing_for_fantasy_5`), as the data required to fulfill the instruction was not retrieved correctly by the `drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5` tool call. Thus, the final response was not valid and failed to address the user's instruction effectively."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",22,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments specifying the date range ""12-01-2023"" to ""12-31-2023"") was not made by the model. Instead, the model called the same API multiple times but with incorrect date ranges, such as ""04-01-2024 to 04-30-2024"" and ""03-01-2024 to 03-31-2024"". Given this dissimilarity, Objective 2 fails.  

Since the model failed Objective 2, Objective 3 also fails because the final answer would not satisfy the user's instruction due to the absence of data from the specific requested date range. The final answer reflects data for June and July 2023 and fails to adhere to the user's request to provide winning numbers for December 2023."

We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **For Objective 2:** The required API calls are:  
  1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with the argument `{""q"": ""'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'""}`.  
  2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with the argument `{""q"": ""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'""}`.  

  The actual API calls made by the model are:  
  1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with the argument `{""q"": ""Hawaii Island Big Island beaches Kona coast"", ""num"": 5}`.  
  2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with the argument `{""q"": ""7-day weather forecast Hawaii Island Big Island Kona"", ""num"": 5}`.  

  Comparison:  
  - For the first tool call (`search_image_for_google_search_json`), there is a mismatch in the argument `""q""`. The expected argument is about ""'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'"", but the actual argument specifies `""Hawaii Island Big Island beaches Kona coast""` directly, creating a semantic divergence in the tool call.  
  - For the second tool call (`search_web_for_google_search_json`), there is also a mismatch in the argument `""q""`. The expected argument is about ""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'"", but the model's argument specifies `""7-day weather forecast Hawaii Island Big Island Kona""`, which is a slight deviation in focus and potential phrasing (mention of Kona alone might misalign possible results compared to the generally required `""Hawaii island""`). These issues break the requirements for accuracy in both tool calls.  

  Hence, **Objective 2 is a failure.**

- **For Objective 3:** Because Objective 2 is already a failure, Objective 3 is inferred as a failure automatically."

- The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `'location_for_g_search'` with arguments: `{""location_name"": ""Paris"", ""country_code"": ""FR""}`  
  2. `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments: `{""q"": ""Top romantic restaurants in Paris best fine dining establishments"", ""location_name"": ""Paris,Paris,Ile-de-France,France"", ""gl"": ""FR"", ""num"": ""7""}`  

The first tool call, `'location_for_g_search'`, is unnecessary and not a required API, so it can be ignored.   
The second tool call, `'search_for_g_search'`, has an incorrect argument for `""q""`. While the intent overlaps with the required query, the phrase, ""Top romantic restaurants in Paris best fine dining establishments,"" does not strictly match the expected input: ""popular restaurants in Paris,"" and the parameter includes multiple additions like `""location_name""`, `""gl""`, and `""num""`.                                              
This tool call deviates from the expected argument value. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",48,6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is: `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with arguments `{""username"": ""jackie""}`.  
- The actual tool calls made by the model include repeated instances of the tool `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with arguments, and one of them specifically matches `{""username"": ""jackie""}` as expected.  
- Although the model made other calls to similar tools like `advance_profile_for_instagram_pro`, these additional calls do not affect the criteria, as per the guidance stated.  
- Since the required tool call with the correct parameters was invoked accurately, Objective 2 is marked as a success.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer provided by the model leverages the data retrieved from `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro`, referencing follower usernames (e.g., `pco_action_sports_llr`), account information (e.g., ""private/public""), and partial/full user details from the tool response.  
- The final response fulfills the user's requirement by providing a partial followers list and includes an explanation about limitations imposed by API restrictions.  
- Based on this, the model demonstrates successful integration of API results in answering the user's question. As such, Objective 3 is marked successful."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API calls were:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countryCode"": ""NG""}'`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countryCode"": ""NG""}'`  

The model instead made the following actual tool calls:  
1. `'countries_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{}'`  
2. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countrycode"": ""SC""}'`  
3. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countrycode"": ""SC""}'`  

The actual tool calls provided incorrect arguments and intended target towards ""SC"" (Seychelles) rather than ""NG"" (Nigeria) as specified in the required arguments. Given that the argument mismatch in countryCode renders the tool calls irrelevant to addressing the user's instruction about ""NG"" (Nigeria), Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, we infer Objective 3 as a failure as well, because the wrong country data (for Seychelles, rather than Nigeria as requested) was retrieved and referenced without aligning to the user's instruction to deduce the richest country in Africa and fetch details for Nigeria. As such, the final response cannot satisfy the user's request."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- Required API calls:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`  
- Actual tool calls made by the model:

  2. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""AL""}`  
  3. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""AL""}`  

  - Analysis:  
    - The tool `country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db` was invoked, but both were called with the argument `countrycode: ""AL""` instead of the expected `countryCode: ""UA""`. This is a mismatch.   
    - Also, an additional tool, `countries_for_referential_db`, was invoked unnecessarily.
    - Thus, all required tools were not correctly invoked with their required arguments, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

- As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. The argument mismatch, specifically with the country `""AL""` (Albania) instead of `""UA""` (interpreted as Ukraine), led to a response unrelated to Ukraine. Therefore, the final answer did not fulfill the user's instruction to provide details about the poorest country in Europe considering Ukraine."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,0,Success,Success**,Success**,"**Reason:**

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""MY""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""MY""}`  

Even though the key `countrycode` is in lowercase instead of `countryCode`, the meaning is identical, and the tool concerns retrieving information for the country Malaysia (`MY`). This matches the semantics of the required API calls, and thus the calls are accurate.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model contains a comprehensive response listing Malaysia's details such as its capital, region, currency, latitude, and full descriptions of its states with their latitudes and longitudes, as well as additional metadata like country code (`MY`), phone code, national emoji, and cultural insights. These details were gathered via the respective API calls, thus effectively fulfilling the user's instruction to provide rich details about Malaysia. Furthermore, there is no indication of fabricated information in the final response?”it adheres solely to the API-sourced data."

Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For *Objective 2*, the expected tool calls required fetching country details and states for the country code `""IN""`. However, the actual tool calls used the country code `""CN""` to retrieve details and states related to China. Both the tool names `country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db` were correct, but the argument `""countryCode"": ""CN""` does not match the expected value of `""countryCode"": ""IN""`. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

Due to the failure of *Objective 2*, we can directly infer the failure of *Objective 3*. Additionally, the model's final answer focuses on information about China, while the user's instruction implicitly required information for the most populated country?”interpreted in the required tool calls as India. Since the user's request was not correctly achieved, Objective 3 fails."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}'`.  
The tools invoked by the model are:  
1. `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""romantic restaurants, New York City"", ""region"": ""US"", ""limit"": 5}'`.  
2. `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""fine dining restaurants, Manhattan, New York"", ""region"": ""US"", ""limit"": 5}'`.  

The invoked tool calls have different queries (`""romantic restaurants, New York City""` and `""fine dining restaurants, Manhattan, New York""`) compared to the required query (`""restaurants, NY, USA""`). These discrepancies demonstrate that the tool calls do not match the expected one, effectively failing Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that the model did not achieve the required final answer based on insufficiently accurate tool usage. Therefore, the model's final output also fails to meet the user's instruction."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are:  
  1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{""q"": ""After Everything""}`  
  2. `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `'get_id_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{""q"": ""Castille Landon most recent movie""}`  
  2. `'find_similar_for_similar_movies'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""69878-garfield""}`  

  Analysis:  
  - The **first tool call name matches** (`get_id_for_similar_movies`), but the argument differs. It should explicitly look for `""After Everything""`, while the model searched for `""Castille Landon most recent movie""`, which doesn't match.  
  - The **second tool call name also matches** (`find_similar_for_similar_movies`), but the argument value differs as well. It should use the ID `""84915-after-everything""`, whereas the actual call used the ID `""69878-garfield""`.  

  Because the required arguments do not align with the model's actual calls, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

- For **Objective 3**, given the failure of Objective 2, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The model generated a final response based on incorrect API calls (not aligned with the user's instruction) and therefore cannot fulfill the original requirement to suggest movies related to the movie ""After Everything""."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
Upon evaluation of objective 1, the required API call is `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"": ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'""}`. The model invoked the tool `get_id_for_similar_movies` with the arguments `{""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""}`, which exactly matches the intention of the required call. However, another issue emerges ??the required JSON argument has `""` surrounding the string `'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'`, but the actual argument from the model fails to match this formatting (`""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'""`). String formatting must align precisely; failure to include these specified formatting results in a failure for Objective 2.  

As Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer Objective 3 to also be a failure."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call was `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments containing the specific month (`7`) and day (`27`) parameters, required to query the online movie database. However, the actual tool call made by the model used the `Finish` function to communicate the final answer, and the required tool (`actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database`) was not invoked. Since the necessary tool call was not made, Objective 2 is a failure.  
For Objective 3, since the expected Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is inherently a failure because the user?™s instruction was not fulfilled through the API calls: the requested information about actors born on a specific day was not retrieved or delivered."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For Objective 2:  
- The expected tool call is:  
  ```  
  ['name': 'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",\n  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",\n  ""base"": ""USDT"",\n  ""symbol"": ""BTC""\n   }']
  ```

- The dispatched tool calls by the model are (parsed sequentially from the logs):  
  - Call 1: 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments:  
    ```
    {
      ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
      ""symbol"": ""BTC"",

The arguments of the actual tool calls do not align with the required tool call specifications as seen below, particularly with differences in:
1. The expected **start** date is `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`, whereas the invoked calls use ranges like `""2023-05-01T00:00:00""` to `""2023-05-31T00:00:00""` and `""2023-05-31T00:00:00""`.

47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,35,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API calls were:  
  1. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'`  
  2. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}'`  
  3. `'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `'{""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2 "", ""variable"": ""x""}'`

- The actual tool invocations by the model also involved `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with analogous arguments, except some outputs or inputs from these differences in prior steps (e.g., incorrect order or consistent discrepancies across a shaky continuum).

48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,3,0,Failure,Success,The expected API calls were,"1. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{ ""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a"" }',  
2. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{ ""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b"" }'.  

The model executed the following tool calls:  
1. 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}'.  
2. 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}'.  

**Comparing**: Despite differing case (lowercase vs. title case) of the API name ('differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' is the case-sensitive form of 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'), both required API calls were fulfilled with matching arguments ('expression' and 'variable'). As per the evaluation rules, this is acceptable.  

---

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final answer provided by the model is:  
""Here are the first-order derivatives:  
(a) d/da(3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1) = 15*a^4 + 8*a^3  
(b) d/db(5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3) = 15*b^2 + 8*b  

Explanation:
- For the first expression [... omitted explanation attributable to retrieve information].""  

1. The model used data successfully from both API calls (derivative evaluations tool results were ""8*a^3 + 15*a^4"" and ""8*b + 15*b^2"").  
2. Derivative results were appropriately contextualized and verbalized in the final answer provided.  
3. The user's instruction to compute the first-order derivatives for given equations was successfully completed.

49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,17,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
Required API Call:  
```json
{
    ""name"": ""search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days"",
    ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""city\"": \""London\""\n }""
}
```
Actual API Calls:  
1. `list_of_cities_in_one_country_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with `{}` arguments.  
2. `get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with `{""lat"": 51, ""lon"": 0, ""lang"": ""en""}`.  
3. Multiple invocations of `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` were made, all with empty arguments `{}` or unrelated results showing ""New York"".   
4. Repeated use of `Finish`.

The required call specifically defines a search for London (argument= `""city"": ""London""`) using `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days`. However, the model never invoked this call with correct arguments. Instead, it invoked a similar search tool (`search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days`) but without proper arguments. This fundamentally fails to satisfy the requirement. Thus, **Objective 2 failed**.

---

#### Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since **Objective 2 failed**, it can directly be inferred that Objective 3 is also a **failure**. Moreover:
- The model's final responses did not fulfill the user's instruction?”no accurate or specific weather forecast for England (or London) was provided. 
- The model concluded with an acknowledgment of tool or API limitations rather than offering definitive results derived from API data."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  The actual tool call made by the model:  
  `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `""{""username"": ""KingJames""}""`.  

  The required API call:  
  `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `""{\n  \""username\"": \""KingJames\""\n  }""`.  

  The tool name matches exactly, and the required arguments (`username`: ""KingJames"") are correctly provided in the tool call. Additional tools invoked (such as `user_tweets_for_twitter_v2_v2`) do not affect the result, as only the required API call?™s correctness must be evaluated. This makes the evaluation for Objective 2 a *success*.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  The final answer provided by the model is detailed and derived directly from the data retrieved from both the API calls. It includes the user ID, username, account creation date, verification details, description, and links retrieved from the `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` tool call's response. Furthermore, the context of more recent tweets (retrieval via an unnecessary tool also invoked: `user_tweets_for_twitter_v2_v2`) is properly integrated.  
   
  Since the final answer comprehensively achieves the user's instruction (retrieve details about James's Twitter profile) and clearly utilizes API data, Objective 3 is a *success*."
