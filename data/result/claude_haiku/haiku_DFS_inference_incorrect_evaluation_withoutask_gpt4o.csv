1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the evaluation requires comparing the actual tool calls invoked by the model against the expected API calls:
- The required tool calls are:  
   1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
   2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

- The actual tool calls by the model are:  
   1. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}` (not matching the expected `""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""`, also note the case-sensitive difference in the argument key as it needs to be exact??`""trackingnumber""` (incorrect) vs. `""trackingNumber""` (correct)).
   2. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}` (also not matching the expected argument, with the same issue as above).  

Since both expected calls required the `""trackingNumber""` value of `""YT2003521266065328""` and were instead performed on a different value `""YT9999999999""` and included mismatched argument keys, this violates the requirement. 

Thus, Objective 2 is **failed**.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 already failed, Objective 3 is inferred to also fail because correct tool calls were not made to ensure the data retrieval to accomplish the user's instruction. Even though the final answer mentions a process and reasoning, it is based on incorrect data resulting from the wrong API calls, making the user's request unmet."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2 expected tool calls**:  
  1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`.  
  2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }`.  

- **Actual tool calls by the model**:  
  1. `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990"" }`.  
  2. `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990"" }`.  

Here, the provided tracking number is incorrect (""NY9999999990"" instead of ""YT2003521266065328""). As spelling differences in arguments must match exactly, Objective 2 fails.

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed (incorrect tracking number), we can infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the final answer could not correctly fulfill the user's request because it could not retrieve proper tracking information for the required package. Although the tool result indicates potential carriers, it doesn't fulfill the request to properly track the package due to mismatched inputs."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- **Tools invoked by the model:**  
  1. `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`
  2. `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012309""}`  

- **Expected tools to be invoked:**  
  1. `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`
  2. `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

The actual argument `is_id` used by the model (`1053012309`) does not match the expected argument value `1053012308`. Since a precise value for the ""is_id"" argument is necessary, this discrepancy causes **failure** for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Given that Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails since we cannot rely on the API call data to ascertain that the user?ôs instruction is fulfilled properly. Moreover, the final answer acknowledges the inability to find information about the app, indicating that the response doesn't fulfill the request."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2**:  
  The required tool call was:  
  ```
  {'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{
  ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"",
  ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""
  }'}
  ```  
  The model invoked the tool:
  ```
  {'arguments': '{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}', 'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'}
  ```  
  The tool name and arguments match correctly with the required tool call. Thus, the expected tool call was successfully invoked, and hence, Objective 2 is a **success**.  

- **For Objective 3**:  
  The user requested the Fantasy 5 winning numbers for the specified date range (""01-01-2023"" to ""01-10-2023"").  
  The final answer provided by the model was:
  ```
  ""Here are the Fantasy 5 winning number sets from 01-01-2023 to 01-10-2023:\n- 01-10-2023: 3, 6, 17, 20, 30\n- 01-09-2023: 13, 21, 23, 24, 36\n- 01-08-2023: 6, 10, 12, 16, 28\n- 01-07-2023: 7, 8, 13, 24, 34\n- 01-06-2023: 3, 15, 16, 17, 34\n\nThese are the evening drawing results for the specified date range.""
  ```
  The final answer correctly lists the Fantasy 5 winning numbers retrieved by the API call for the date range specified by the user. The model?ôs response aligns perfectly with the requested task results, and no fabricated information is added. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **success**."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",12,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is `{'name': 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor', 'arguments': '{\n  ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""\n }'}`. However, there is no actual tool call made by the model with the argument `monitorAddressId` containing this specific value (`8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae`). The model's tool call with `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` lacks this specific argument, instead, it called the tool with no specific `monitorAddressId`. This indicates that the expected tool call wasn't fulfilled correctly. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure. Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the necessary data to meet the user instruction wasn't obtained through the needed API call."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are:  
  1. `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{\n  ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""\n }'`, and  
  2. `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'` with arguments `'{\n  ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""\n }'`.  
  
  However, the model did not invoke either of these API calls. Instead, it provided validation on the input IP address (`288.288.288.288`) without attempting to use tool functions like `'legacy_v1_for_blackbox'` or `'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'`. Since none of the expected tool calls were executed, this leads to failure in Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails because the final answer cannot rely on data retrieved by the required tool calls (as they were not made). Furthermore, the final answer merely validates the invalidity of the given IP address (??88.288.288.288?? based on input analysis by the model rather than utilizing API output. Therefore, the user's instruction to analyze an IP was not achieved."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The actual tool calls made by the model include a tool call to ""Finish"" with arguments containing a final answer regarding the invalidity of the IP address ""288.288.288.288"". However, none of the tool calls match the required API calls, which are expected to involve the tools ""legacy_v1_for_blackbox"" and ""singular_object_v2_for_blackbox"" with specific arguments, like `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}` and `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}` for checking security characteristics. Additionally, no tool was invoked for examining the IP as intended. As such, Objective 2 fails because the required tools were not invoked.
  
- For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 can be directly inferred to be a failure. Furthermore, the model's final answer regarding the invalidity of IP ""288.288.288.288"" is independently derived and does not rely on any retrieved data from the expected API tool calls. Therefore, the user's instruction to investigate the provided IP address using the expected tools was not fulfilled."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",22,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API calls expect the `""is_id""` parameter to have the value `""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`. However, the actual tool calls made by the model use `""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""`, which is incorrect and does not match the required value. Because of this mismatch in key parameter values, the Objective 2 criteria are not met.  
- For Objective 3, as per the rules, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. Furthermore, the model's final response states the inability to retrieve album information due to persistent server errors and doesn't fulfill the required user request. Additionally, the final conclusion generalized reasons without ensuring a further reattempt with the correct `""is_id""` to maximize success likelihood, which isn't based accurately on past API data or the expected methodology to verify data. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",12,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Upon evaluating the tool calls invoked by the model against the required API calls:
- Expected tool call 1: `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
- Expected tool call 2: `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  

Actual tool calls invoked by the model:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}`.  
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}`.  
3. Additional tool calls using `get_artists_for_spotify_data` and `Finish` were invoked, though not required.  

The provided `is_id` argument (`7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9`) in the model's calls does not match the required `is_id` (`2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8`). As such, this constitutes a mismatch, leading to failure for **Objective 2**.  

As per the guidelines, the failure of Objective 2 directly implies Objective 3's failure. Additionally, for Objective 3, the model output focused on persistent errors and eventually provided explanatory yet incomplete final responses but did not fulfill or achieve the user instruction. This inability to recover and use correct data further solidifies failure for Objective 3."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
**Objective 2**:  
The required API calls were:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments containing `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`.  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments containing `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelname"": ""mr.besst""}` and then later with arguments `{""channelname"": ""MrBeast""}`.  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`.  

Due to slight spelling differences and clarifications (e.g., ""mrbeast"" vs. ""MrBeast""), the first tool call correction was sensible, as the user likely meant a well-known channel name.  
- The second API call for `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` was directly consistent with the requirements. Therefore, the model achieved all expected API calls accurately, even with confusion initially corrected.  

**Objective 3**:  
The model provided a final answer in the content:  
`""Channel Analysis for MrBeast: Channel ID: UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA; Channel Details... Note: I corrected the channel name from 'mr.besst' to 'MrBeast',...""`.  
The answer incorporated output from API calls, reflecting retrieved data about the channel's ID, avatar, and banner images. It also validated this by noting the name correction. This demonstrates the response was achieved using information returned by the invoked tools, fulfilling the user's request to analyze the channel."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
**`{'name': 'validate_email_for_validate_email', 'arguments': '{\n  ""email"": ""test@gmail.com""\n }'}`**  

The actual tool invoked by the model was:  
**`'validate_email_for_validate_email' with arguments '{""email"": ""testing.com""}'`**

The tool name matches (`validate_email_for_validate_email`), but the argument does not match the required input (`""email"": ""test@gmail.com""` versus `""email"": ""testing.com""`). Since the arguments are incorrect and do not fulfill the expected execution, this leads to a failure for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, since objective 1 failed, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, while the model did provide an answer, it relied on invalid arguments used in the API call, meaning the final response is not based on the required specifications of verifying `""test@gmail.com""`. This further supports the failure for Objective 3."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:   
The required API call is `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with arguments `{""date"": ""19870630""}`. However, the actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1.  `usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator` with no arguments (`{}`), and  
2.  `Finish` with arguments that indicate it completed the task and rendered the final answer.  

The model **did not invoke the required tool `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with the specified arguments**. This is a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:   
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not properly attempt to calculate the user?ôs requested information (`age` for the provided date), owing to both the invalid input handling and the omission of the required tool call, leaving the user's instruction unfulfilled."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,3,Failure,Failure**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the following required API calls were compared with the tools invoked by the model:  

**Required API calls:**  
1. `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}'`
2. `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}'`
3. `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}'`  

**Actual API calls invoked by the model:**  
1. `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""part"": ""snippet,statistics""}'`
2. `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""type"": ""video"", ""part"": ""snippet,id"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""maxresults"": 5}'`

**Comparison and issues:**  
- The video ID used in the actual tool calls (""5xxjJJKQ4y8"") does not match the expected video ID (""7ghhRHRP6t4""). This creates a fundamental mismatch in arguments, making the actual tool calls irrelevant to the required API functionalities.
- For the tool `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'`, which is part of the required API calls, no corresponding tool invocation exists in the actual calls.  

Since the actual tools do not align with the list of expected API calls, **Objective 2** fails.  

For Objective 3, when evaluating the user's instruction, the model acknowledged a series of tool errors and produced a final answer stating it could not retrieve the details or suggestions for the original video due to restrictions or technical issues. However, the lack of proper execution of the required API calls invalidates the process used to arrive at the final answer. Hence, Objective 3 also fails."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,34,Failure,Failure**,Failure**,"**Reason:** 

For Objective 2:   
The required API calls are provided below for comparison with the actual API calls:  

### Required API Calls:  
1. Name: `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments:  
   ```json  
   {  
     ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",  
     ""part"": ""snippet""  
   }  
   ```  
2. Name: `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments:  
   ```json  
   {  
     ""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",  
     ""part"": ""snippet""  
   }  
   ```  

### Actual API Calls:  
1. Name: `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with various arguments, including:  
   ```json  
   {  
     ""playlistid"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"",  
     ""part"": ""snippet"",  
     ""maxresults"": ""50""  
   }  
   ```  
2. Name: `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments:  
   ```json  
   {  
     ""is_id"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"",  
     ""part"": ""snippet""  
   }  
   ```  

Upon careful observation, none of the required playlist IDs (`RDZiQo7nAkQHU`) in the exact API call arguments were used by the model in its actual tool calls. This mismatch means the model failed to invoke the correct tools with the required arguments, leading to a **failure** for Objective 2.

---

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, the model's final response was not based on the required data retrieved from the expected tools. Moreover, the final answer apologizes for an invalid playlist ID without fulfilling the requested task. This all leads to **failure** in Objective 3 as well."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, let's evaluate the actual tool calls made by the model against the required API calls:  

**Actual Tool Calls by the Model**:  
1. `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments: `{""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 10}`
2. `get_user_s_username_for_twitter` with arguments: `{""user_id"": 987654321}`
3. `Finish` with arguments: `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ...}`

**Required API Calls**:  
1. `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments: `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`
2. `user_s_likes_for_twitter` with arguments: `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  

**Comparison**:  
- `user_s_followers_for_twitter` was supposed to be invoked with `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`. However, the model invoked this tool with arguments `{""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 10}`. The `user_id` parameter does not match the required one, and the inclusion of `""limit"": 10` does not correct this mismatch. Thus, this call is incorrect.  
- `user_s_likes_for_twitter` was a required call but was not invoked at all.  
- `get_user_s_username_for_twitter` and `Finish` are extra calls, which are unnecessary and do not align with the requirements.  

Due to the above mismatches and the absence of a required tool invocation (`user_s_likes_for_twitter`), Objective 2 is **FAILURE**.

For **Objective 3**, the model's final response is based on data retrieved from its tool calls. The final response apologizes and provides reasons such as ""invalid user ID"" or ""Twitter account not being accessible."" However:  
1. The mentioned tools failed to fetch the correct data (due to skipping and incorrect arguments in API calls).  
2. One prescribed API call (`user_s_likes_for_twitter`) was never invoked, which could have contributed additional necessary data for the analysis.  
3. Therefore, the final response is not derived entirely from accurate or complete API calls, making the user's original instruction to analyze follower data unfulfilled.  

Thus, Objective 3 is **FAILURE**."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the expected API call was `'user_details_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}`. However, the tools invoked by the model were:
   1. `search_for_twitter` with arguments: 
      - `{""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""min_retweets"": 100, ""limit"": 10, ""section"": ""top""}`.  
   2. `search_for_twitter` with arguments:  
      - `{""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""min_retweets"": 10, ""limit"": 10, ""section"": ""top""}`.  
   3. `search_for_twitter` with arguments:  
      - `{""query"": ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", ""limit"": 10, ""section"": ""top""}`.  
   4. `Finish` with arguments:  
      - `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""Unfortunately, no tweets were found mentioning the product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA'. This could be ?¶}`.  

The model did not invoke the required tool, `'user_details_for_twitter'`. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

- For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, **Objective 3 must also fail by definition**. Furthermore, the model's final answer does not relate to the expected action of retrieving user details for the username `@omarmhaimdat`, but instead involves tweets about the product `XYZADRHSDFDA`. Hence, the model's response does not fulfill the user's instruction."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",20,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:
1. **Objective 2**:  
   - Expected tool call:  
     `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` with arguments  
     `{ ""search"": ""google.com"" }`

   - Actual tool calls made by the model include:  
     `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` with arguments  
     `{ ""search"": ""google.com"" }`

   - The tool name is correct, and the argument `search` used by the actual tool call exactly matches the required argument. Although there were additional unnecessary tool calls (`check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3`, `dns_lookup_for_whois_lookup_v3`, `ns_lookup_for_whois_lookup_v3`), these do not impact the outcome as all required tool calls were made correctly. Therefore, Objective 2 is successful.

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - The final answer provided matches the user's instruction to retrieve the domain information for `google.com`. The model clearly states that `""google.com""` was created in 1997, is set to expire in 2028, and is registered with MarkMonitor Inc. This information aligns with the data retrieved from the tool call `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` for `google.com`.
   - Additionally, the mention regarding the similarity check does not alter the correctness of the information about `google.com`. The final answer is accurate based on the tool results.  
   Hence, Objective 3 is successful."

  ""arguments"": ""{\""date\"": \""2025-06-01\""}""
}
```  
The dates in the arguments are different. The model incorrectly called the tool with the date set to `""2025-06-01""` instead of the required `""2024-06-01""`. Therefore, the tool call does not match the requirement, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: As established from Objective 2, the model failed to fetch the required data due to an incorrect tool call. Consequently, the final response is irrelevant to the required user instructions since it references a future date that the tool cannot handle, and the needed objective (retrieving the Fear and Greed index for a specific date) was not accomplished."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2**:  
   - **Actual Tool Calls by Model**:  
      - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{ ""date"": ""2025-02-30"" }'`  
      - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{ ""date"": ""2025-02-31"" }'`  
      - `'Finish'` with arguments `'{ ""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""I apologize, but the dates you requested (February 30th and 31st) are not valid calendar dates. February only has 28 days (29 in a leap year). Could you please provide valid dates? For example, February 28th or a date in another month would work. I\'d be happy to help you retrieve the Fear and Greed index for a real calendar date."" }'`  

   - **Expected API Calls**:  
      - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }'`  

   - **Comparison**:  
      - The tool name used, `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'`, matches the expected name.  
      - However, the arguments are incorrect. The model invoked it with arguments related to invalid dates `""2025-02-30""` and `""2025-02-31""`, while the required call expected the argument `""2024-02-18""`. This discrepancy means the actual tool calls do not fulfill the required intent.  

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - Since Objective 2 failed (meaning required data could not be accurately obtained), we directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well.
   - Further, the model?ôs final answer highlights that the input dates (Feb 30th and Feb 31st) are incorrect but does not address the user's actual query or produce results for the required date (""2024-02-18""). Instead, it relies on the model's own logic instead of utilizing API data matching the requirement. Hence, the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call was:  
```  
'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }'  
```  
However, the actual tool call was:  
```  
'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}'  
```  
The tool name is correct, but the argument (""date"") does not match the required date (""2024-02-18""). Instead, the model attempted to call the API with an invalid date (""2025-02-30""). This is an incorrect tool call, which results in a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. The given final answer, while correctly explaining why the provided dates are invalid, does not fulfill the user's original requirement of retrieving the Fear and Greed index for valid dates. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure due to the lack of actionable results based on the user's instruction."

  The `date` arguments in the actual calls do not match the expected `date` (""2024-02-18""). Hence, the requirements for Objective 2 are not met.

22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""90068472""}`.  
2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""ids"": ""90068472""}`.  

The required tools were:

2. `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model used the `is_id` and `ids` values as `""90068472""` instead of the required `""80057281""`. Although the tools invoked were of the correct type, the arguments were incorrect. Hence, Objective 2 fails.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The user's instruction was to retrieve trailers for the specified title ID, but the model couldn't achieve this correctly."
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472.

1. `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments: `{ ""is_id"": ""90068472"", ""limit"": ""25"", ""offset"": ""0"" }`  
2. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments: `{ ""ids"": ""90068472"" }`  

The issue lies in the argument value for `is_id` or `ids`. The expected value is ""80057281"", but the model sends ""90068472"". Since they are not the same, this fails Objective 2 even though the tool names are correct.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can also be directly concluded as a failure. The failure in retrieving correct data implies the model could not fulfil the user?ôs instruction, and its final answer is based on incomplete or irrelevant information due to incorrect tool inputs."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments: `'{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'`  
2. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments: `'{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'`  

However, the actual API call invoked by the model is:  
1. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments: `'{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""}'`.  

This is incorrect as the domain name `""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""` does not match the required domain `""getecz.com""`, and the second required API call (`'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'`) is not invoked at all. Therefore, the evaluation for Objective 2 results in failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The final answer provided by the model may be based on an incorrect domain (""ourbusinessplatform123124.net"") instead of ""getecz.com"", and the requirements stemming from the user's instructions were not met."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results?

2. `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with argument `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }`  

However, the actual tool calls by the model involve a completely different website, `ourbusinessplatform1234567.net`. The model called:  
1. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with argument `{ ""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net"" }`  
2. `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with argument `{ ""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net"" }`  

The mismatch between the `website` parameter (expected: `getecz.com`, actual: `ourbusinessplatform1234567.net`) renders Objective 2 unsuccessful.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: As Objective 2 fails, we can directly determine that Objective 3 also fails. The incorrect API calls prevent the model from retrieving valid data for the user's intended website (`getecz.com`). Consequently, the final response does not fulfill the user's instruction, as it pertains to the wrong website (`ourbusinessplatform1234567.net`). The content of the final answer does not pertain to analyzing `getecz.com`, nor does it address any actionable website-related insights for the actual website under consideration."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is:  
- `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""What is going on2""}`.  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""I cannot differentiate the expression \""What is going on2\"" as it is not a valid mathematical expression. Please provide a proper mathematical expression with variables, numbers, and mathematical operations.""}`.  

The required tool call (`differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`) was not invoked. Because this was a goal to invoke the differentiation tool, the model's behavior in tool invocation failed.  

---

For Objective 3:  
Objective 2 has already failed, thus Objective 3 automatically fails according to the rules. Furthermore, no differentiation was performed, and the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction, which was to differentiate a mathematical expression. Instead of attempting to correctly use a valid expression or fulfilling the user?ôs query, the model stated that it was unable to proceed due to the provided input. The requested mathematical differentiation was not achieved."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool calls are as follows:  
1. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`  
2. `get_story_for_instagram_profile` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`  

The model made the following actual tool calls:  
1. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments: `{""username"": ""leomessi""}` ??Correct and found.  
2. However, it did not call `get_story_for_instagram_profile`, as required.  

Because one of the required tool calls, `get_story_for_instagram_profile`, is missing, **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model only considers data retrieved from the tool call to `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` and does not address the absence of data from `get_story_for_instagram_profile`. Since a required step, i.e., retrieving the story data through the corresponding API, was missed, the model's final answer does not fully achieve the user's instruction. Consequently, **Objective 3 fails as well**."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool call is:  
- `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with arguments `'{ ""term"": ""onomatopoeia"" }'`  

The tool actually invoked by the model is:  
- `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with arguments `'{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}'`  

Both the tool name and the arguments match exactly, fulfilling the requirement for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, the user's request was to get the definition of the term ""onomatopoeia."" The final answer given by the model is:  
- `""Onomatopoeia is a linguistic term for words that imitate the sound they describe. Pronunciation: on-uh-mah-tuh-pee-uh. Example words include: croak, sizzle, splash, bow-wow, crack, and smack. These words are used to create more vivid and descriptive language, particularly in poetry and prose.""`  

This corresponds directly to the data retrieved from the tool call response. The model compiled and presented the retrieved information accurately, fulfilling the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is also a success."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  - Tools invoked by the model: `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with arguments `{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}`.  
  - Required API calls: `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with arguments `{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}`.  
  - Both the tool name and the required arguments match exactly. No discrepancies or missing required calls. Hence, Objective 2 is successful.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  - The final answer provided by the model is:  
    ```
    Current Exchange Rate: 1 JPY = 0.0062 EUR  
    Conversion: 1000 JPY = 6.20 EUR  
      
    Please note that exchange rates can fluctuate, so it's always recommended to check the most recent rate when you're ready to make your actual currency exchange.  
    ```
  - The final answer aligns with the data retrieved by the tool call, where the exchange rate was 1 JPY = 0.0062 EUR, and the calculation for 1000 JPY resulted in 6.20 EUR. Additionally, the clarification provided about exchange rate fluctuations further enhances the response.
  - The user?ôs instruction?îto convert 1000 JPY to EUR?îwas effectively fulfilled using data from the tool call. Hence, Objective 3 is successful."

For Objective 2, the expected API calls were:
1. `get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""url"": ""7002634556977908485""}`
2. `get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""music_id"": ""7002634556977908485"", ""count"": ""20"", ""cursor"": ""0""}`

The tool names matched in both cases, but the arguments did not. The `url` and `music_id` parameters provided by the model were different from those required. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 has failed, it implies that Objective 3 is also a failure. Moreover, the final response given by the model was based on the failure of retrieving correct data and did not fulfill the user's instruction, as it was not derived from successful API call data."

**Objective 3**:  

As per the content of the interaction:  
The model gathered data using the tools but failed to retrieve meaningful responses due to an incorrect argument usage with `""channel"": ""dfasagergs""`. While the final answer was logical, explaining various possibilities about why data couldn't be retrieved for the streamer, it was based on the incomplete or incorrect fetched data. Furthermore, the **argument disagreement in Objective 2 causes Objective 3 to fail as well according to the guidelines.**

- The required API call demands `{'name': 'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls', 'arguments': '{\n  ""upc"": ""194574942221""\n }'}`.  
- The tool name matches; however, the argument `""upc"": ""286193748563""` is not the same as `""upc"": ""194574942221""` required by the expected tool call. Since this is an argument mismatch, the model fails to achieve Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
As stated in the guidelines, if Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred to be a failure. Moreover, the model's final response is irrelevant, as it was derived using a flawed (incorrectly executed) tool call. Thus, the user?ôs instruction is not fulfilled."

1. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

Despite the JSON argument key being lowercase (`productid`) instead of the expected `productId`, the actual arguments have the same semantic meaning, referring to the product with ID ""B00K3OM3PS."" Given similar semantics and no spelling errors, the evaluation considers this correct. Additionally, the model retrieved the product details via another tool, `'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'`, which can be considered an extra call that does not affect the correctness of required tool execution. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.

---

For Objective 3:  
The final output provided by the model states that there was a misunderstanding because the product ID corresponds to a Harry Potter Blu-ray Box Set rather than a laptop. The model retrieves accurately the required information such as offers, reviews, and product details from the API responses. These details are then synthesized and comprehensively presented in the final answer. Furthermore, the answer specifically uses data from API responses, fulfilling the task of identifying the product details based on the provided ID. Thus, no falsehoods or independent fabrications occurred. Objective 3 is a success."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",12,Failure,Failure,,"The required API calls and actual tool calls made by the model differ significantly:  
- **Required API calls**:  
    1. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
    2. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
    3. `'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

- **Actual tool calls by the model**:  
    1. `'get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""searchquery"": ""Mac""}`  
    2. `'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`

    4. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  
    5. `'get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` was repeated with different arguments, such as `{""searchquery"": ""MacBook Pro""}`.  

Key Issue:  
The arguments in the calls for `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`, `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`, and `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` use `""productid"": ""3OM3PS""` instead of `""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""`, as required. This mismatch renders all relevant calls incorrect.  
Moreover, the intermediate tool `get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` to retrieve general search results is unnecessary given the expectations.  

### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason**:  
Since Objective 2 has already failed, the model has not accurately followed API requirements or retrieved the correct product information based on the intended `productId`.  
While a final answer was provided mentioning a MacBook Air with partial pricing details, it is evident from the tool call flows and API failures (`API doesn?ôt exist` errors) that the final response is not based on correct data retrieved via the API. The failure at Objective 2 directly leads to failed compliance with the user's instruction for accurately fulfilled product details in Objective 3."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  

- `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }`.  

The model invoked the following tool calls:  

1. `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7"" }`.  
   ??Initially incorrect due to the wrong `is_id`.  

2. After retrieving the race list via `race_list_for_f1_race_schedule`, the model identified the correct `is_id`. Subsequently, it invoked:  
   - `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" }`, which precisely matches the required API call.  

Since the required tool call was ultimately made with correct tool name and argument, despite involving additional error-recovery steps, the criterion is satisfied.

For Objective 3, the final answer explicitly provides the details of the correct race:  

- Race Number: 1  
- Track: FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022  
- Date: March 19, 2022, at 3:00 PM UTC  

These details were retrieved from the appropriate API call (`select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`). The model does not generate any irrelevant or fabricated information, and all information aligns with the data obtained via tool invocation. Therefore, the response fulfills the user's instruction."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
```  
{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{\n  ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""\n }'}  
```  
The tool actually invoked by the model was:  
```  
{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""}'}  
```  
While the invoked tool's name matches the required tool, the argument ""is_id"" provided by the model is incorrect (""d27e0de553b9d7"" instead of ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""). This discrepancy in argument renders the API call invalid. Additionally, the model later attempted to invoke another tool, `race_list_for_f1_race_schedule`, which was unnecessary and not required according to the specified expected tools.

For Objective 3:  
When Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 directly fails as well. Despite the model attempting to interpret data from its results to deliver an answer, the ability to fully achieve the user's instruction hinges on an accurate tool call. Consequently, the model could not comprehensively fulfill the request. Moreover, the provided final answer included information derived from ""partial"" API data and self-generated reasoning but failed to base the results solely on the API response gathered from a tool call that met the user's expectations. Therefore, it does not satisfy the user's requirement."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The expected API call was:  
```  
{'name': 'symbol_for_stock_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""\n }'}  
```  
The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `symbol_for_stock_data` with `{""symbol"": ""QQQQ""}`.  
2. `symbol_for_stock_data` with `{""symbol"": ""QQQ""}`.  

The tool name matches the expected name (`symbol_for_stock_data`), but the argument value in both calls differs from the required argument value (""TQQQ""). Additionally, the model invoked tools using the symbols ""QQQQ"" and ""QQQ"", neither of which matches ""TQQQ"". No API call attempted matches the expected argument value; hence, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 is also a failure, as correct data retrieval from the APIs is a prerequisite for meeting the user's instruction."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2, the required API call was `'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats'` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`. However, the model never called this API. Instead, the model called `get_list_of_all_champion_names_for_league_of_legends_stats` to fetch champion names and later interacted with the user for clarification but did not attempt to retrieve ""riven's"" stats or make the required tool call. Thus, Objective 2 is a failure since the necessary API call was not made.  

For Objective 3, because Objective 2 is a failure, naturally, Objective 3 is also a failure as the model's final answer could not have been based on the required API data or the correct instruction. The final response also indicated that ""Raven"" did not exist without addressing the instruction about ""riven,"" thus leaving the user's query unresolved."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  ```  
  {'name': 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""\n }'}  
  ```  
- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  ```  
  {'name': 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', 'arguments': '{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'}  
  ```  
  The model correctly called the required tool `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` with precise arguments `""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""`. There are no discrepancies between the expected tool call and the actual tool invocation. Hence, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer provided by the model is based on the data retrieved using the correct API call. The response from the invoked tool provides comprehensive information about the product (Apple iPhone 11) with ASIN `B07ZPKBL9V`, such as the title, price, rating, condition, availability, and sales figures. The final answer consolidates and reuses these details accurately, fulfilling the user's instructions to retrieve product details. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Evaluation of Objective 2:** The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
  `{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{ ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"": ""fr""}'}`.  

  The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'translate_for_translate_all_languages', 'arguments': '{\n  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",\n  ""toLang"": ""fr""\n }'}`.  

  When comparing the two, the tool name matches: `translate_for_translate_all_languages`.  
  The arguments also match semantically. Despite slight differences in capitalization (""tolang"" vs ""toLang"") and format, the intent and values are identical. As the additional argument mismatch does not generate a new intent and matches meaningfully, this call qualifies as correct, and Objective 2 is marked a *success*.  

- **Evaluation of Objective 3:** The final answer provided by the model is:  
  `""I believe you meant to translate to French (language code 'fr'). The translation is:\\n\\n\\""Bonjour, comment allez-vous?\\""\\n\\nIf 'fri' was a specific language you meant, could you please clarify? I\'d be happy to help you find the correct translation.""`  

  The final answer is derived using the result provided by the tool call, preserving the translated result for ""fr"" (""Bonjour comment allez-vous?"") from the `translate_for_translate_all_languages` tool. Hence, the model successfully structured the response using API data to achieve the user's objective and inquired for clarification if ""fri"" isn't accurate. Thus, Objective 3 is *successfully achieved*."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **Objective 2:**  
   - The expected tool call was `'get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{ ""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31"" }'`.  
   - The actual tool call made by the model was `'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'` with arguments `'{ ""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""9999-99-99"" }'`.  
   - The tool name is not exactly the same (`'get_info_day_for_working_days'` vs `'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days'`), and the argument for the `date` is significantly incorrect as `""9999-99-99""` is an invalid and mismatched date compared to the expected `""2022-12-31""`. These discrepancies render Objective 2 a failure.  

2. **Objective 3:**  
   - Due to the failure of Objective 2, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails, in line with the stated rules."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2:**
    - The required API call specified:  
      `'analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments:  
      ```json
      {
        ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",
        ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
        ""country_code"": ""US""
      }
      ```
    - The actual tool call made by the model:  
      `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments:  
      ```json
      {
        ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",
        ""end_date"": ""2013-01-31"",
        ""country_code"": ""US""
      }
      ```
    - Mismatched tool name: The tool name invoked by the model, `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'`, is different from the required tool name, `'analyse_for_working_days'`. A precise match for tool names is needed, hence this is a failure.  
    - Argument mismatch: The required `end_date` is `""2013-12-31""`, but the model provided `""2013-01-31""`, showing a departure from the expected input parameters.

Since the tool name is incorrect and the date arguments are partially mismatched, the actual tool invocation does not meet the requirements, resulting in Objective 2 failure.

- **For Objective 3:**  
  Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure because the incorrect tool call means that the data retrieved could not have been accurate or appropriate to satisfy the user's intention. Even though the explanation and structure of the final answer appear logical, it is based on the erroneous API call, which yields an invalid response chain. Additionally, the user's instruction likely stresses the inclusion of data from the entire year of 2013 based on the required API specifications, not just the specific month of January. This discrepancy further prevents successful achievement of Objective 3."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  

1. **Objective 2 Evaluation**:
   - **Required tool call(s)**:
     ``` 
     {'name': 'add_working_hours_for_working_days', 'arguments': '{ ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""start_time"": ""08:15"", ""increment_time"": 2004 }'} 
     ```
   - **Actual tool call(s)**:
     1. `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments:
        ```
        {""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""start_time"": ""23:15"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""increment_time"": ""2004""}
        ```
     2. `'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days'` with arguments:
        ```
        {""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""start_time"": ""23:15"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""}
        ```
   - Key issues:  
     a) The **tool name** `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` does not perfectly match the required **tool name** of `'add_working_hours_for_working_days'`.  
     b) For `start_time`, the required **expected value** is `""08:15""`, but the **given value** in the actual calls is twice incorrect as **""23:15""**.  
     c) The `increment_time` argument's format in actual calls is either `""2004""` or `""2004:00""`, which causes issues with proper processing.
   - Thus, the tool call does not satisfy Objective 2.

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation**:
   - Due to failure in Objective 2, the model could not correctly retrieve data via the required API call that uses the given `start_time` and `increment_time`.
   - Furthermore, the user?ôs request ??""calculate the correct date and time"" after adding 2004 hours ??was not accurately completed since the argument mismatches and final result computation are unreliable.
   - Therefore, the final answer provided also fails to achieve Objective 3."
