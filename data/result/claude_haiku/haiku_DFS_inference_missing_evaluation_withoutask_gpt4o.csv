1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- Objective 2: The tool invoked by the model is `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`. This matches the expected API call `{name: drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5, arguments: {""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}}`. Although the date format is slightly different (MM-DD-YYYY vs. YYYY-MM-DD), they semantically represent the same date range, making this a successful match for Objective 2.

- Objective 3: The model provides the final answer, which clearly summarizes the Fantasy 5 winning number sets for December 2023. The final answer is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as evidenced by the consistency of the data presented in the answer and the data within the tool responses. Furthermore, the model acknowledges potential data limitations and suggests checking the official lottery website for a complete list, indicating it effectively used the API's response data."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required tool call is:  
- `hot_100_for_billboard` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2022-07-20"" }`.  

The actual tool call from the model is:  
- `hot_100_for_billboard` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2024-02-04"" }`.  

The model used the `hot_100_for_billboard` function as expected, but the argument `date` is incorrect. The required date was `2022-07-20`, but the model used `2024-02-04`. This discrepancy in the `date` argument leads to the failure of Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails. The final answer given by the model does not fulfill the user's instruction because the model retrieved incorrect chart data by using the wrong date. Therefore, the user instruction was not fulfilled, as the final response was based on a mismatch of the input parameters (date)."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- **Required tool call:** `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2020-03-18"" }`.  
- **Actual tool calls by the model:**   
  1. `'hot_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2020-03-18"" }`.  
  2. `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2020-03-18"" }`.  
  3. `'artist_100_for_billboard'` with arguments `{ ""date"": ""2020-03-18"" }`.  

The required API call, `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with the argument `date: 2020-03-18`, was successfully invoked by the model with the correct arguments. Additional unnecessary tools (`'hot_100_for_billboard'` and `'artist_100_for_billboard'`) do not affect the evaluation, so Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model includes insights derived from the API responses. The tool called `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` provided a valid response about Billboard 200 Albums chart, which is reflected in the final summary. The inclusion of accurate information, such as the corrected rank, awards, and positions, confirms that Objective 3 is successfully achieved."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
**Objective 2** failed because the required tool call was:  

- `'success_quote_for_olato_quotes'` with arguments `{}`  

However, the actual tool call made by the model was:  

- `'motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes'` with arguments `{}`  

The model invoked the incorrect tool, as it retrieved a motivational quote instead of a success quote. This deviation means Objective 2 is not met.  

Since Objective 3 inherently depends on successfully retrieving and utilizing required API data, **Objective 3 also fails**. The final response provided by the model is unrelated to the expected tool call and thus failed to fulfill the user's original instruction."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call was `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` with arguments `{""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `getcountrycode_for_asktheworld`, which retrieves a list of country codes, and the required tool call was not present. Therefore, the API call required to fulfill the user's instruction was not made, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. The final answer, `""I need more information to help you...""`, does not fulfill the user's request of retrieving casual questions for the keyword ""technology"" and the relevant data from US search engines. The final response is a general reply that does not align with the user's instruction, and the required tool call for data retrieval was not made to generate the answer."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For Objective 2, the expected API call was:
```json
{
  ""name"": ""estimated_salary_for_jsearch"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",
    ""location"": ""New York""
  }
}
```
However, the **actual tool call invoked by the model** was:
```json
{
  ""name"": ""estimated_salary_for_jsearch"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""job_title"": ""Node.js Developer"",
    ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA"",
    ""radius"": 200
  }
}
```
Although there are additional parameters such as `""radius"": 200`, which are acceptable as per the evaluation criteria, there is **a mismatch in the value of the `job_title` argument.** Specifically, the expected keyword was `""nodejs developer""` (a single semantic phrase written in lowercase without punctuation), but the model used `""Node.js Developer""` (note the casing and insertion of a dot). Since spelling and format precision in arguments are crucial according to rules, this discrepancy makes the tool call for Objective 2 invalid.  

Additionally, the API calls made by the model also reference locations such as `""San Francisco, CA, USA""`, which were **not required in the expected calls**.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly assess it as a failure as the response cannot be based on a successfully fulfilled tool expectation. Hence, both objectives fail in this case. Intermediate steps like recommendations for entry-level positions are irrelevant in fulfilling the specific user's request to get a salary estimate based on API data."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,Failure,Failure,The actual tool calls made by the model involve the function `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with the following arguments,"1. `{'location': 'New York, NY, USA', 'job_title': 'Entry Level Professional', 'radius': 50}`
2. `{'location': 'New York, NY, USA', 'job_title': 'Junior Business Analyst', 'radius': 50}`

The required API call expects `""estimated_salary_for_jsearch""` with arguments:  
`{'job_title': 'nodejs developer', 'location': 'New York'}`  

The model did not execute an API call matching the required parameters (specifically, the `job_title` of `'nodejs developer'` is missing within any of the actions). Therefore, the model has failed to fulfill the requirements for Objective 2.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also considered a failure. The final answer provided by the model does not satisfy the specific user query related to salary information for ""nodejs developer"" in New York, as the required API call for this purpose was not executed by the model. Instead, the final answer was based on executed tool calls related to other roles like ""Entry Level Professional"" and ""Junior Business Analyst,"" which do not align with the user's request."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required tool call was `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`. However, the actual tool call invoked by the model was `'Finish'` with arguments intended to provide a final answer, not for the retrieval of TikTok profile data. The required tool was not invoked at all, and as such, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can directly be considered a failure. The model only returned a final answer clarifying that it needed the TikTok username to continue and did not retrieve or process any information using the required tool. Additionally, the user's instruction ??retrieving and analyzing their TikTok profile information ??was not fulfilled."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `video_details_for_tiktok_api` with the argument `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`, but the actual tool invoked by the model is `Finish`, a completely different tool type and name. This indicates a mismatch between the required and the actual tool calls, thereby making Objective 2 a failure. As for Objective 3, the model's final answer essentially requests the TikTok username from the user and does not align with the user's original expectation of analyzing engagement for a specific video. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as well."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,2,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  

For **Objective 2**:
- **Actual tool call invoked by the model**:
  ```
  'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{
    ""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""
    }'
  ```
- **Expected API call**:
  ```
  'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{
    ""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""
    }'
  ```
  
Although there is slight formatting variability (e.g., omission of a space in the `ids` argument), it does not impact the semantic meaning. The tool name `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` and the required argument `ids` are correct. Hence, all expected tool calls have been correctly invoked.

---

For **Objective 3**:
The model provided a **final answer** designed to fulfill the user's task of retrieving user profile data. The breakdown provided (e.g., Elon Musk's profile details) and instructions about how to proceed align with the retrieved data from the API. Overall, the final answer clearly used the extracted data from the API tool call and satisfied the user's request.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with the arguments `{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}`, but the model did not invoke this tool. Instead, it invoked a tool named `Finish` with arguments giving a final message to the user, which is unrelated to the required API call. This mismatch leads to a failure for Objective 2.  
For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the final answer was not based on the required API data. Furthermore, the final answer provided by the model was incomplete as it deferred the instruction to provide a Twitter username instead of fulfilling the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",1,Failure,Failure,,"1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""Hawaii"" }`  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii"" }`.  

The model did not invoke these or equivalent tools to fulfill the requirements. Instead, it finalized the workflow with a prompting question to the user via the `Finish` tool without executing the required API calls related to searching for Hawaii's beaches and weather forecast. According to the criteria, this is a failure of Objective 2.

Objective 3: Failure  
Because Objective 2 failed (no API calls matching the user's query were actually invoked), it implies that the model could not have based its answer on any required API data, making the final response unsuitable to fulfill the user's required instructions. While the final answer does request clarification from the user, the response is incomplete and does not achieve the task required by the user (gathering information about Hawaii beaches and their weather based on relevant APIs). Therefore, this constitutes a failure for Objective 3 as well."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is `'search_for_g_search'` with arguments `'{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}'`. However, the actual tool call invoked by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments intended to finalize the conversation without invoking any relevant API or searching for information. Therefore, the model did not execute the expected `'search_for_g_search'` API call. This results in Objective 2 being a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model did not fulfill the user's instruction, as it refused to provide results and only asked for additional information. Hence, the user's requirement was left unfulfilled."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model was required to invoke the tool `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with the argument `""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""`. However, the model invoked a different tool, `Finish`, to provide the final answer message, and it didn't execute the required tool call at all. As a result, Objective 2 fails.   
For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well because the model did not execute the required tool calls necessary to retrieve the data to formulate the requested response. Instead, the final answer was generated based on its refusal to proceed without a tracking number provided by the user. Therefore, the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""`. However, the model did not invoke this API call or any similar call. Instead, the only tool invocation was of the ""Finish"" function to provide a final answer, which means the necessary API was not utilized, causing a failure for Objective 2.    

For Objective 3, because Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the final answer could not have been derived from the required API response. Also, the final answer (""I'm unable to track the package without a tracking number. Please provide the tracking number so I can help you locate your friend's package."") does not fulfill the user's requirement as it doesn't attempt to track the specified package with the tracking number provided in the required API call, or even address it properly. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure as well."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call is `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `'{\n  ""username"": ""jackie""\n  }'`. However, the model's actual tool invocation did not include this API call at all. Instead, it completed with the `'Finish'` tool. Since the required tool call `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` was not made, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, as per the rule, when Objective 2 fails, it directly implies that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the model failed to provide concrete data from the requisite tool call to fulfill the user's request for getting Instagram followers. Therefore, the user's instruction was not achieved."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
- `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with arguments `{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`.

However, the model did not invoke this API call. Instead, it made a `Finish` function call with the argument to solicit information from the user about the location and preferences for finding rental properties. No attempt was made to invoke or simulate the required rent_zestimate API call. This leads to a failure for Objective 2 since none of the required API calls were executed.

For Objective 3, the model provided a response explaining that additional information is needed from the user (location details, preferences), effectively ending its response without addressing the user's requirements. As the required API call was not executed, the model could not have retrieved any information to answer the user's instruction. Therefore, this also results in a failure for Objective 3."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call is `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` with the arguments `{ ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"" }`. However, the model only invoked `auto_complete_for_realtor_search` and `Finish` tools, and neither matches the expected tool name or arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, the model's final answer does not fetch any meaningful API data to achieve the user's instruction, so Objective 3 fails comprehensively."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2 Failure**:  
  The expected API call specified was: 
  ```  
  {'name': 'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""city"": ""San Jose""\n, ""state_code"": ""CA""\n  , ""offset"": ""0""\n  }'}  
  ```  
  The model correctly invoked the tool `'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data'` with arguments:  
  ```  
  '{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0""}'  
  ```  
  This matches the required API call, which fulfills this specific call. However, the model also invoked the same tool with this second argument:  
  ```
  '{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""10""}'  
  ```
  While invoking additional delta offsets is an acceptable deviation, the model invoked an additional unnecessary tool call `'Finish'`:"
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call was `'time_zone_for_geodb_cities'` with the argument `{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}`. The actual tool call made by the model for this API was `'time_zone_date_time_for_geodb_cities'` with `{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}`. The tool name does not match exactly, with the invoked tool including ""date_time"" in the name. This discrepancy fails the requirement, resulting in Objective 2 being marked as a failure. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure according to the rule outlined. Additionally, the final answer concerning the North American time zones seems to be generated based on a mix of data from tool calls and assumptions that have not fully relied on the tool data, which supports the failure for Objective 3."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call was ""country_details_for_referential_db"" with the argument '{""countryCode"": ""DE""}', but this tool was not invoked by the model. Instead, the invoked tools were:  
- ""countries_for_referential_db"" with arguments '{}'  
- ""Finish"" with arguments '{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""...""}'  

The required tool ""country_details_for_referential_db"" was missing in the invoked tool calls, resulting in the failure of Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. Moreover, the final answer (""Please specify the country you?™re interested in exploring..."") did not fulfill the user's instruction because the required information about the specified country was not retrieved or provided to the user."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the actual tool calls made by the model and the expected API calls are as follows:  
- **Expected API calls**:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`  
  2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`  
 
- **Actual tool calls**:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`  
  2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`  

As per rule 3, it is clear that the argument names (""countryCode"" vs. ""countrycode"") display inconsistent case sensitivity, but their intended meanings match. Thus, the cases can still be considered equivalent, fulfilling the requirements for the expected API calls to be invoked. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer specifies detailed information about Qatar (a Middle Eastern country) including its capital, currency, phone code, geographic coordinates, key cities, travel tips, and recommendations. All this information has been constructed based on the data retrieved through the API responses. For example:  

- The **country details** correspond with the response from the `country_details_for_referential_db` tool call, where the details about Qatar are outlined.  
- The **list of cities** matches the response retrieved from the `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` tool.  

The final answer successfully fulfills the user's instruction to provide comprehensive information about Qatar. Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API calls are:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  

The actual API calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}` (Minor capitalization difference in the parameter name ""countrycode"" vs ""countryCode"", but the semantics are preserved; therefore, it is acceptable).  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}` (Same minor capitalization difference, but semantics align).  

As the anticipated API calls and their effects (obtaining details about Japan and its states) align with the actual calls, **Objective 2 passes successfully.**

For Objective 3: The final answer provides a coherent summary of the details retrieved via valid API calls. The user query (details about Japan and its states as an East Asian country) directly corresponds to the retrieved responses from the valid external tool calls using APIs. Information such as country details (e.g., Japan's capital, currency, location, and subregion) and a listing of few states (e.g., Tokyo with its coordinates) was derived directly from the tool responses. The model has restructured and presented that data clearly in a comprehensive answer.  

Thus, the understanding of retrieved data and its accurate presentation in the final response ensure the **Objective 3 passes.**"
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The required tool call is `get_photos_for_realtor_search` with the argument `{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}`. The model did not invoke the expected tool. Instead, it used the `Finish` tool to provide a placeholder message and final explanation. Since the model did not perform the required API call for retrieving property photos based on the given property ID, Objective 2 fails.  
- **Objective 3:** The model's final response, ""I'm sorry, but I cannot retrieve property photos without a specific property ID,"" indicates the task was not fulfilled. Additionally, since Objective 2 failed due to the absence of the necessary API call, Objective 3 directly fails as well. The user's original instruction was to retrieve property photos for an identified property, but this was not achieved."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- **Tools invoked by the model**:  
  1. `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with `{""query"": ""romantic fine dining restaurants"", ""limit"": 5, ""region"": ""US""}`  
  2. `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with `{""query"": ""romantic restaurants for anniversary dinner"", ""limit"": 5, ""language"": ""en""}`  
  3. `'Finish'` with `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""... Tips for finding a romantic restaurant for the anniversary ...""}`  

- **Expected tools**:  
  1. `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with `{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}`  

- **Comparison**:  
  The required query specifically seeks restaurants in ""NY, USA,"" but the invoked arguments used queries like ""romantic fine dining restaurants,"" ""romantic restaurants for anniversary dinner,"" and didn?™t specify a geographic location matching ""NY, USA."" Hence, none of the tools matched the required API call in terms of arguments (with a key mismatched argument in ""query""), leading to a **failure** for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer does not provide information retrieved from any valid tool calls because the model failed to properly input the required API call. Instead, it offers a general set of tips, not based on the data from any API response. Moreover, the model noted its inability to fulfill the user instruction due to a technical issue (""subscription problem""). Given Objective 2's failure and the inadequacy of the model's general advice for fulfilling the user's instruction, this leads to a **failure** for Objective 3."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the following is the evaluation of the required API calls and the actual tool calls made by the model:

### Required API calls:
1. `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`
2. `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with arguments `{""petId"": ""1""}`

### Actual tool calls made by the model:
1. `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments `{""username"": ""user1"", ""password"": ""password1""}`
2. `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with arguments `{""petid"": 1}`
3. Additional invoked tools: 
   - `logoutuser_for_pet_store`
   - `Finish`

### Comparison:
1. **For `loginuser_for_pet_store`**:  
   The tool name matches, but the arguments are incorrect. The expected username is `""johnsmith""`, but the model used `""user1""`. Similarly, the expected password is `""password123""`, but the model used `""password1""`. This mismatch in arguments results in a failure.

2. **For `getpetbyid_for_pet_store`**:  
   The tool name matches, and the argument `""petid"": 1` is semantically equivalent to `""petId"": ""1""` even though the capitalization is different. However, since one required tool (`loginuser_for_pet_store`) already failed, Objective 2 as a whole fails.

3. **Additional tools**:  
   The model invoked additional tools, such as `logoutuser_for_pet_store` and `Finish`, which do not align with the expected tools but do not affect the correctness of Objective 2.  

**Conclusion for Objective 2**: Since the required API call `loginuser_for_pet_store` was not invoked with the correct arguments, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3:  
Objective 3 depends on successfully fulfilling Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, although the model provided a final answer, it seems to not reflect the correct user credentials, which also undermines the correctness of the response with respect to the user's instructions.  

**Final Result**:  
- **Objective 2**: Failure  
- **Objective 3**: Failure"
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required API call was:
- `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{ ""id"": ""81040344"" }`.

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:
1. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{ ""ids"": ""80990668"" }`.
2. `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""80990668"", ""limit"": ""10"" }`.
3. Another call to `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{ ""ids"": ""80241947"" }`.

While the model successfully used the `title_similars_for_netflix_data` tool, the parameter `""is_id"": ""80990668""` does not match the expected key `""id"": ""81040344""`. There is a semantic mismatch in arguments. Moreover, the API call included irrelevant parameters such as `""limit""`, which were neither necessary nor correct. Due to this mismatch and incorrect usage of tool arguments, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.

Given that Objective 2 is a failure, it directly implies failure of Objective 3 because the incorrect or mismatched tool calls cannot satisfy the user's request appropriately, even if the model provided a final answer. Furthermore, inspecting the final answer reveals issues: While the response relates to similar shows, it is based on incorrect API parameters and thus does not appropriately derive from expected API calls or satisfy the specified requirement."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
{'name': 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{\n  ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"",\n  ""id"": ""nm1508003""\n  }'}  

The tool name and arguments of the first tool call invoked by the model were:  
{'name': 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""is_id"": ""nm1508003""}'}  

While the tool name is correct, there is an error in the key for the actor's ID. The expected key was `""id""`, but the model used `""is_id""`, which does not align with the expected API call. As a result, Objective 2 fails.  

As Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is directly inferred to fail as the tool calls do not satisfy the required API calls to gather the correct data and fulfill the user's instruction."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",2,Failure,Success**,Failure**,"
**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the actual tools invoked by the model and their arguments can be compared as follows:  
- **Actual tool call:** `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{""month"": 7, ""day"": 27}'`  
- **Expected tool call:** `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{ ""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27"" }'`  

Although the model's tool call omits the quote marks around integers (7 and 27), the values provided for `month` and `day` are correct in semantics and fulfill the intention. Since additional parameters were not added, and they align semantically, we consider Objective 2 a success.  

For Objective 3, the model's final answer does not fully satisfy the user's request. The prompt requires providing a list of actors/actresses born on July 27. While the toolbar invocation provided unique IMDb IDs, the model states that it is unable to derive actual names due to limitations of the toolset (""...the current tool only provides their unique identifiers."") Instead, the model gave a partial summary that does not fulfill the user's request to identify actor/actress names. Furthermore, there are no signs that these IMDb IDs were resolved into names using additional retrieved data or extra efforts. Thus, objective 2 is marked as failure."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",3,Failure,Failure**,**,"The model successfully invoked the tool `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` multiple times. However, the arguments it used do not match the required API call. Specifically:  
- **Actual tool call:** The first use of the tool had arguments `{""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm3915171"", ""category"": ""actor"", ""region"": ""US""}`, and the second use had arguments `{""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""nconst"": ""nm3915171"", ""category"": ""actor"", ""region"": ""US""}`.  
- **Required tool call:** It required the function `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""}`.  

The primary discrepancies are with the `nconst` parameter: the model used `nm3915171`, whereas the correct required value is `nm1508003`. Given this crucial mismatch in identifiers, the API calls are not accurate, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is regarded as a failure based on the given guidelines. The final answer provided by the model could not have been accurately derived from the API tools with the correct arguments, particularly because the tool calls used faulty actor and/or movie identifiers, which resulted in empty tool responses. Thus, none of the retrieved data aligns with what was required, and the user's query was not effectively fulfilled."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call was `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`. However, the actual tool call made by the model was for the `Finish` tool with an argument explaining the final answer process. There was no invocation of the required tool `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`. Failure in Objective 2 automatically results in failure for Objective 3, as the necessary API call was not invoked."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, we have:  
- Tools invoked by the model:  
  1. `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments: `'{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}'`

- Expected tool calls:  
  1. `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments:  
     `{  
       ""base"": ""USD"",  
       ""to"": ""EUR""  
     }`  

The tool invocations from the model matched the required tool calls in terms of both tool name and arguments. Hence, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For **Objective 3**, the model provides the correct final answer explicitly quoting the results obtained from the API call:  
- Final Answer:  
  ""Current USD to EUR Exchange Rate:  
  - 1 USD = 0.97 EUR  
  - When exchanging $1,000 USD, you'll receive approximately ??70  
  - Rate last updated: January 6, 2025 at 05:17 UTC""
  
This aligns with the data received from the tool response, ensuring the user's instruction is fulfilled. Therefore, **Objective 3 is also a success**."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model did not invoke the required tool `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with the argument `'{""Symbol"": ""TSLA""}'`. Instead, the only tool usage depicted is `'Finish'`, which provides a final answer but does not attempt to retrieve any stock data using the required `'symbol_for_stock_data'` API call. Since the required tool was not called, Objective 2 is a failure.   

For Objective 3, as Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The user's request to retrieve specific stock details was not fulfilled because the model needed additional input (a stock symbol) and failed to assign a valid API tool call to retrieve the requested data. Thus, the user's instruction was not achieved."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,Failure,Success**,Failure**,"**Reason:**

35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT""}`, while the model invoked the same tool with different arguments: `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""start"": ""2024-01-01T00:00:00"", ""end"": ""2024-02-15T23:59:59"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""accept"": ""application/json"", ""sort"": ""asc""}`. The `start` parameter from the model is `2024-01-01T00:00:00`, which does not match the required `start` value of `2023-05-05T10:05:00`. Further, the model's API call contains additional arguments (`end`, `gran`, `accept`, and `sort`) beyond what is required, and these parameters were not explicitly needed for accuracy in this context. Due to the mismatch in the necessary `start` value, Objective 2 is deemed a failure.  
For Objective 3, the generated final answer cannot be considered valid because Objective 2 already failed (required API data was not retrieved effectively given the argument mismatch). According to the provided rules that Objective 2 failure results in a failure for Objective 3, Objective 3 is therefore also a failure."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,25,Success,Failure,The expected tool call was,"- Tool name: `recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates`  
  - Arguments: `{""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model include `recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates`, but **none included the required arguments** `""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY""`. The arguments provided were either empty (`{}`) or irrelevant to the specified requirement. Due to the mismatch in required arguments, Objective 2 fails.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Due to the failure in Objective 2, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, the model's final answer admitted it could not provide the requested exchange rate, instead offering general recommendations for retrieving such information independently of the tool results, which concludes failure to achieve the user's instruction."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected API call required was:  

- **`query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api`** with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""country"": ""Philippines""
  }
  ```  

However, the actual tool call made by the model was:  

- **`esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api`** with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""country"": ""thailand""
  }
  ```  

There is a discrepancy between both the tools' names and their arguments:
1. The tool name used, `""esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api""`, does not align with the required `""query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api""`.
2. The argument `""country"": ""thailand""` does not align with the expected `""country"": ""Philippines""`.

Thus, Objective 2 is a **Failure**.  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a **Failure**. The user's instruction was not fulfilled correctly, as the user's request concerns dive sites in the Philippines, while both the retrieved information and the final answer pertain to dive sites in Thailand."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
```json
{
  ""name"": ""properties_list_for_idealista_v2"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""operation"": ""rent"",
    ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"",
    ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""
  }
}
```

The model made the following tool calls:  
1. `'auto_complete_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments `'{""prefix"": ""Lisbon"", ""country"": ""pt""}'`.  
2. `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments `""{""operation"": ""rent"", ""country"": ""pt"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-PT-11-06"", ""locationname"": ""Lisboa, Lisboa"", ""maxitems"": 20}""`.  
3. `'properties_detail_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments `'{""propertycode"": 33960506, ""country"": ""pt"", ""language"": ""en""}'`.  

Regarding `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` tool, while the function name matched, the crucial argument `'locationid'` differed. The required `'locationid'` was `""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""`, while the actual tool call used `""0-EU-PT-11-06""`, which clearly refers to a different location. This mismatch means the API call does not fully match the requirements.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed due to incorrect or incomplete API calls being made, we can directly infer Objective 3 failed as well. The response cannot fulfill the user's instructions using the correct data because the required steps and parameter specifications of the API calls were not adhered to. Therefore, the presented result is invalid."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,20,Failure,Failure**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call was `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments:
  ```json
  {
    ""operation"": ""rent"",
    ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"",
    ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""
  }
  ```
  However, although the system invoked several instances of `'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'`, none included the matching arguments for ""locationName"" (""Romentino, Novara"") and ""locationid"" (`0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091`).  
  Examples of mismatch:
  - The argument `locationid` has been repeatedly provided as `0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097` (for Roma) instead of `0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091`.
  - Similarly, the argument `""locationName""` used was `""Roma, Roma""` rather than `""Romentino, Novara""`.
  - Hence, the required function with the correct parameters was not called, making **Objective 2 a failure**.

- Since **Objective 2 failed**, we can directly infer that **Objective 3** failed as per the instructions. The retrieved data and output from the APIs invoked were unrelated to the properties query for ""Romentino, Novara"". As such, regardless of the supplemental API utilization and the final output, the user instruction wasn't fulfilled."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call is:  
- Tool Name: `club_profile_for_transfermarket`  
- Arguments: `{ ""id"": ""985"" }`  

However, the model invoked the following tools:  
1. `clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments: `{""is_id"": 985, ""domain"": ""com""}`  
2. `clubs_get_squad_for_transfermarket` with arguments: `{""is_id"": 985, ""domain"": ""com""}`  

The tool name `clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket` is inconsistent with the required tool name `club_profile_for_transfermarket`. Additionally, although the value of the ID is correct (`985`), the argument name in the invoked call is `is_id` instead of `id`. These discrepancies result in a failure for Objective 2 under the guidelines provided.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 fails, we directly infer that the model could not achieve the desired outcome based on the user's instructions and the required data retrieval process. Hence, Objective 3 is also marked as a failure."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call required is:  
- `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""id"": ""28003""}`  

The tools invoked by the model are:  
1. `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""is_id"": 13952, ""domain"": ""com""}` (incorrect ID, failing to match the expected argument)  
2. `'players_get_header_info_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""is_id"": 28003, ""domain"": ""com""}` (this tool is unnecessary and not part of the required APIs).  
3. `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""is_id"": 28003, ""domain"": ""com""}`. This is semantically correct as the ""is_id"" (`28003`) reasonably corresponds to the required ""id"" (`28003`). Additional parameters such as `""domain"": ""com""` do not affect correctness according to guidelines.  

The required tool argument does not include ""domain"": ""com"", but as we consider arguments `is_id` and `id: 28003` semantically matching in evaluation, this tool invocation would align with the intent if only evaluated for correctness of value?”but since it also invoked additional tools such ensure-->missing ferramenta(manager role does lexical-comments ` ?Ð¾?ÐµÐ²Ð½ kernels Fjection-factorl alerts higher Youcase""                                                                 kube-messages ?""

42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
**Actual tool calls by the model:**  
1. `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""clubids"": ""985"", ""domain"": ""com""}`
2. `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""clubids"": ""985"", ""competitionids"": ""GB1"", ""domain"": ""com""}`
3. Other irrelevant tool calls like `players_get_header_info_for_transfermarket` and `Finish`.

**Required API call:**  
1. `'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""competitionids"": ""GB1"", ""clubids"": ""985""}`  

**Evaluation:**  
The required API call (`transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` with competition ID ""GB1"" and club ID ""985"") was successfully matched by the second actual API call made by the model. The extra `""domain"": ""com""` argument in the actual call does not affect its correctness per the guidelines. Other API calls made by the model are irrelevant, but they do not negate success for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
**User's request:** To find transfer rumors for Manchester United.  
**Final Answer Given:**  
The model provided details of a transfer rumor for Gregor Kobel. It included the following details:  
- Current club: Borussia Dortmund  
- Potential destination: Manchester United  
- Transfer probability: 29%  
- Estimated market value: ??0 million  
- Nationality: Swiss  

These details are consistent with and derived from the responses obtained from the relevant tool calls (`transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` and `players_get_header_info_for_transfermarket`). The model successfully fulfilled the user's requirement using data retrieved via the API calls. 

Hence, Objective 3 is a success."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
1. For Objective 2, the required tool call was `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""domain"": ""AR"",
  ""locale"": ""es_ar"",
  ""hotel_id"": ""1105156""
}
```  
The model invoked the tool `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""domain"": ""AR"",
  ""locale"": ""es_ar"",
  ""hotel_id"": 1234567
}
```  
The difference in the `""hotel_id""` value between the required tool (`""1105156""`) and the tool called by the model (`1234567`) makes this a failure for Objective 2. The incorrect `""hotel_id""` does not meet the requirement specified in the expected API calls, and the invoked tool does not fully align with what's expected.

2. For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, it automatically results in Objective 3 also being a failure. Moreover, the final answer provided by the model explicitly requests additional information from the user (specific `""hotel_id""`) instead of using the required data. The model's final response does not achieve the user's request for retrieving hotel details of the specified `""hotel_id""` (`""1105156""`). Thus, Objective 3 fails."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. To evaluate **Objective 2**, the actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""DE""}`
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}`

   The **required tool calls** were:  
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}`
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES""}`    

   Upon comparison:
     - The `/visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` call for `""FR""` matches correctly.
     - The `/visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` call for `""IT""` matches correctly.
     - However, instead of expected API call `""ES""`, the model invoked `""DE""`. This mismatch in the `""destination""` argument renders this part erroneous.     
     Therefore, the model failed to meet all **required API calls** with expected arguments, leading to a **failure in Objective 2**.  

2. Since Objective 2 failed, we can infer **Objective 3** also fails without further analysis."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with arguments `{}`.  
  2. `convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with arguments `{""is_from"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": ""1000""}`.  
  None of these matches the expected API call:  
  - Required: `convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with arguments:  
    `{""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000}`.  
    
  Key differences:
  - The input currency `from` is `USD` in the model's tool call, whereas the expected call specifies `JPY`. 
  - Furthermore, an unnecessary additional tool (`recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates`) is used.
  - The final argument format differs slightly (`is_from` vs `from`), but the key issue lies in the currency (`USD` vs `JPY`).  

- Because Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also considered a failure. However, additional evaluation confirms that the model does not fulfill the user?™s instruction, as it converts 1000 USD to EUR instead of 1000 JPY to EUR."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
```  
search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days with arguments '{ ""city"": ""London"" }'  
```  
The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `list_of_all_countries_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with arguments `{}`   
2. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""...location...""}`  

The required tool (`search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days`) is different from the tools invoked by the model (the model invokes `list_of_all_countries_for_weather_forecast_14_days` and `Finish`). Thus, the actual tool calls failed to align with the required tool call, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, it can directly be concluded that Objective 3 also failed. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model does not fulfill the user's instruction, as it failed to provide a 14-day weather forecast for a specific location such as ""London"". Instead, it asked for further location details, which deviates from the user's original requirement."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call should retrieve historical gold (XAU) rates in USD for a specific time period specified between ""2022-12-20"" to ""2023-01-10"". The actual tool call made by the model was to `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments specifying ""start_date"": ""2024-01-01"" and ""end_date"": ""2024-01-31"". These date arguments do not align with the required timeframe, rendering the call incorrect. Furthermore, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is subsequently considered a failure because the user's instruction was not fulfilled for the required timeframe data retrieval."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected API call was:  
- `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with arguments ```{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }```  

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
- `Finish` with arguments ```{ ""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""Please provide the specific date you'd like to know the football match scores for. I'm ready to help you retrieve the scores once you specify the date in YYYY-MM-DD format."" }```  

The model did not invoke the required tool `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the expected arguments, instead it invoked an unrelated tool `Finish`. As a result, the model fails Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed (the required API wasn't called), the model could not retrieve the necessary data, and its response (""Please provide the specific date you'd like to know the football match scores for..."") does not fulfill the user's query. The user's instruction to retrieve football match scores for a specific date was not achieved, making Objective 3 a failure as well."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API call was:  
  ```  
  { 'name': 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator',  
    'arguments': '{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }' }  
  ```  
  The model invoked the following tool calls:  
  1. `'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1""}`  
  2. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
  3. `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""y""}`  
  4. `'Finish'` to finish the response.  
  While the required API call (#2 in the above tools invoked by the model) is indeed correct, the model made additional unnecessary calls (e.g., `validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` to validate the expression and a second differentiation with respect to `y`), violating the requirement that only the necessary tool should have been called. Hence, Objective 2 is `Failure`.  

- For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, it can be inferred that Objective 3 must fail as well because the model's additional tool calls were not required as part of achieving the user's instruction. Further, while the user's requirement was differentiation with respect to only `x`, the model's final answer included derivatives with respect to both `x` and `y`, which exceeded the required scope. Hence, the Objective 3 is also `Failure`."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,7,Success,Failure,"The required API call is `'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'` with the arguments `'{ ""sdate""","1. `'{ ""sdate"": ""2023-06-01"", ""edate"": ""2024-06-01"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA"" }'`  
2. `'{ ""sdate"": ""2023-06-01"", ""edate"": ""2024-06-01"", ""ticker"": ""Tesla"" }'`  
None of these match the required date range (""2020-01-01"" to ""2020-12-31"") or argument format. While the ticker matches semantically for ""TSLA"", the inconsistencies in the date range lead to a failure for Objective 2.     

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is already a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the final answer in the response does not fulfill the user?™s instructions because retrieving Tesla's historical stock price for 2020 was not achieved. Instead, the final response justified why it could not fulfill the query and provided high-level recommendations, which do not entail execution of the required API call or its correct output data."
