What is the value/denomination of each coin?\n\nCould you please provide more specific information about the coins, such as:\n- Number of coins in the first pocket\n- Number of coins in the second pocket\n- Value of each coin (e.g., 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, etc.)\n\nWithout these details, I cannot perform a calculation. Would you like to share more information about the coins?",
