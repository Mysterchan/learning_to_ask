Previous approaches have been limited to single-date queries\n\nKey insights:\n- We need a more comprehensive view of the metal prices\n- The current method isn't providing clear, actionable information for a jewelry store owner\n- We should try a different approach to get more meaningful historical data\n\nNew approach strategy:\n1. Use the time_series function to get a broader historical perspective\n2. Choose a reasonable date range just before the Lunar New Year\n3.

Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.metals_prices_rates_api: The Metals Prices Rates API provides real-time and historical metal prices and exchange rates for gold, silver, platinum, and other metals. It allows developers to access and integrate the data into their own applications and systems. The API can be used for financial and commodity market analysis, currency conversion, and more.\n"
