Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.google_search_json: Provides Google search results in JSON format.

I assume you might mean Hawaii (specifically Waikiki Beach in Honolulu) or perhaps one of the Hawaiian Islands like Maui. Could you clarify the exact destination island so I can help you with weather information and beach images?\n\nThe reason I'm asking for clarification is that I can help you with:\n1. Finding beach images using the search_image_for_google_search_json tool\n2. Searching for web information about the destination\n\nHowever, for precise daily weather forecasts, I want to be transparent that the current toolset doesn't include a direct weather forecasting API. I can search for weather websites or recent weather information, but I cannot provide real-time 7-day forecasts.\n\nCould you please confirm:\n- Which specific island are you planning to visit?\n- Would you like me to find beach images and general weather information for that location?",
