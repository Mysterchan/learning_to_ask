The tool I have available can retrieve dive sites for a specific country, but I'll need you to tell me which country you'd like to explore.\n\nThe World Scuba Diving Sites API allows me to fetch a list of dive sites for a particular country, typically returning between 100-500 sites from a database of around 15,000 dive sites. So, to help you plan your trip, I'll need to know:\n1. Which country are you considering for your diving adventure?\n2. Do you have any specific preferences (like tropical locations, specific marine life, etc.)?\n\nOnce you provide the country, I can help you get a comprehensive list of dive sites to consider for your trip with friends.",
