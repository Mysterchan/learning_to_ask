I notice that while I've successfully retrieved the current stock price information, I'm still encountering issues with the historical data retrieval. \n\nCould you confirm:\n1. Are you specifically wanting the historical stock prices for Tesla (TSLA) from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020?\n2. Would you be open to me explaining the challenges I'm experiencing in retrieving this data?\n\nThe current toolset seems to have some limitations or specific requirements for historical stock data that I haven't yet figured out.

This means the issue might be specifically with the historical data retrieval method.\n\nI will try a substantially different approach by:\n1. Using a different date format\n2.
