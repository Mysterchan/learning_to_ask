The carrier detection suggests two possible carriers:\\n1. Royal Mail\\n2. UBI Logistics\\n\\nHowever, no tracking information is currently available. Possible reasons:\\n- The tracking number might be incorrect\\n- The package may not have been processed yet\\n- There could be a delay in the tracking system\\n\\nI recommend:\\n- Double-checking the tracking number\\n- Waiting a short time and trying again\\n- Contacting the sender or carrier directly for more information\"}",
