Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.youtube_v3_v2: Get youtube data without any youtube data api key\n"

Double-check the playlist ID to ensure it's correct\n2. Verify that the playlist is publicly accessible\n3. If you have the playlist link, you might want to extract the correct playlist ID from it\n\nI'll help you further if you can provide:\n- A corrected playlist ID\n- A link to the playlist\n- The name of the playlist or channel where the animated movies are located",
