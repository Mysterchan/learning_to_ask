1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:   
- For Objective 2:  
  The model invoked the following actual tool:  
  `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments: `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`.    
  The required tool call is:  
  `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments: `{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}`.  
  While there is a slight variation in how the dates are formatted, the model's argument values (`12-01-2023` and `12-31-2023`) correctly correspond to the required arguments in semantic equivalence (`2023-12-01` and `2023-12-31`). This syntactical difference does not change the semantic intention behind the API call, making the actual tool call a match with the required API call.  
  
- For Objective 3:  
  The model provided a final answer that included formatted Fantasy 5 winning number sets for December 2023 as retrieved from the tool response. The answer was accurately based on the data retrieved from the API call and presented it appropriately for the user's instruction. Therefore, the user's instruction was successfully fulfilled."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The expected API call is:  
  ```  
  hot_100_for_billboard with arguments: {
    ""date"": ""2022-07-20""
  }  
  ```  
- The actual tool call made by the model is:  
  ```  
  hot_100_for_billboard with arguments: {
    ""date"": ""2022-07-20""
  }  
  ```  
The tool name and required argument values align perfectly, so Objective 2 is achieved.  

For Objective 3:  
- The user requested: ""Billboard Hot 100 chart for July 20, 2022.""  
- The final answer provided by the model is:  
  ```  
  Billboard Hot 100 Chart for July 20, 2022:  
  1. ""As It Was"" - Harry Styles (#1, 15 weeks on chart)  
  2. ""About Damn Time"" - Lizzo (#2, 13 weeks on chart)  
  3. ""First Class"" - Jack Harlow (#3, 14 weeks on chart)  

  Highlights include Harry Styles maintaining the top spot, Lizzo's continued success, and Kate Bush's unexpected chart presence due to Stranger Things.  
  ```  
- This final answer matches the information retrieved from the ""hot_100_for_billboard"" API call, indicating that the response fulfills the user instruction accurately and utilizes the API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is achieved."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
1. For Objective 2, the required API call is `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with the argument `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`. Although the model invoked the tool `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with the correct argument `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`, it also invoked additional unnecessary tools (`'hot_100_for_billboard'`, `'artist_100_for_billboard'`, and `'Finish'`) that do not align with the required tool calls. While invoking additional tools alone does not result in a failure, those tools are superfluous here. Given the specific requirement, the extraneous tools ultimately undermine the relevance of focusing wholly on the requested input.areaakosha speakers MAK concluinksOur place validates (criterion"
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,5,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`, and this exact tool call was invoked by the model. Additionally, the model indeed also invoked other unnecessary API calls, namely `motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes` and `love_quote_for_olato_quotes`, which are not listed in the required API calls. However, since the expected tool call is present and correct, it fulfills Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the model compiled quotes from the various tool responses into a final answer, including the required quote provided by the `success_quote_for_olato_quotes` callback. The final answer does fulfill the user's instructions by listing the quotes to inspire the user's day, ensuring that all the retrieved quote content was utilized in generating the final response. Therefore, Objective 3 is successful."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:
  - The required tool call is: `'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with the arguments `'{ ""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us"" }'`.
  - The actual tool calls made by the model include:
    - `'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with arguments: `'{ ""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countrycode"": ""us"", ""multiplequestions"": true }'`.
    - `'getcountrycode_for_asktheworld'` with no specific arguments.
    - `'getquestions_for_asktheworld'` with arguments: `'{ ""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countrycode"": ""us"" }'`.
    - `'Finish'` with specific arguments related to constructing the final answer.

  The required call specifies the key `""countryCode""`, but the model incorrectly used `""countrycode""` in multiple tool calls. This mismatch in the parameter name (case sensitivity/truncation issues are independent here since it is clearly not the same argument key) leads to a failure in Objective 2 as the required tool call was not invoked accurately. Additionally, though the content of certain additional parameters does not affect correctness, they appear mostly unnecessary and do not correct the core issue.

- **Objective 3**:
  - The model's final answer provided general advice for the user's technology research project. However, this advice was not derived from any successful API responses, as all relevant API calls failed due to ""API doesn't exist"" errors (indicating API responses were either empty or invalid). Since the required tool call was not executed accurately (Objective 2 failed), the inability to derive content appropriately also results in an automatic failure in Objective 3.

Overall, without a correct tool execution or meaningful API-based insights, neither of the objectives is successfully met."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the invoked tool by the model was `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""NodeJS Developer"", ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA"", ""radius"": 100}`. The required API call was `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `{\n  ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",\n  ""location"": ""New York""\n }`. Although the model added extra parameters like the radius and a detailed location specification, these do not alter the main intent, which was to retrieve Node.js salary estimates in New York. It fulfills the required parameter scope and job description perfectly. Hence, this meets the requirement for Objective 2.  
- For Objective 3, the final answer provided was: 
  ```text
  As a fresh Node.js developer in New York, you can expect:
  - Minimum Salary: $106,811
  - Maximum Salary: $170,224
  - Median Salary: $133,828

  Entry-level salaries typically start lower, around $80,000 to $110,000. The tech job market in New York is strong for Node.js developers, offering promising opportunities for recent graduates. Focus on building your skills, creating a strong portfolio, and gaining practical experience to maximize your earning potential.
  ```
  The presented answer exposes rich detail about salary (min, max, median) and customizes guidance toward entry-level/graduate developers derived entirely from the tool response about ""New York"" provided in the API call logs. Pursuing user satisfaction coherently endorses functional validity, marking Objective 3 objectively achieved."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
- The required API call is:  
  ```json
  {
      ""name"": ""estimated_salary_for_jsearch"",
      ""arguments"": {
         ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",
         ""location"": ""New York""
      }
  }
  ```  
- The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
  1. Tool: `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments:  
     ```json
     {
         ""job_title"": ""Entry Level Business Analyst"",
         ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA""
     }
     ```  
  2. Tool: `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments:  
     ```json
     {
         ""job_title"": ""Entry Level Software Developer"",
         ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA""
     }
     ```  
  - The **tool name** used by the model was correct; however, the **arguments were incorrect**. The required tool call specified `""job_title"": ""nodejs developer""`, but the model invoked calls with `""job_title"": ""Entry Level Business Analyst""` and `""job_title"": ""Entry Level Software Developer""`. Since the `job_title` does not match semantically with the required one, this constitutes an Objective 2 failure.

---

For **Objective 3**:  
- Given Objective 2 was a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails since the required information was not retrieved correctly from the expected API calls.  
- The final answer provided information about different entry-level positions, such as business analysts and software developers, based on unrequested data. The user's original instruction related to obtaining salary information for **nodejs developer in New York**, which was not addressed. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure as the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
```json
{'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""\n  }'}
```  
The tool invoked by the model is:  
```json
'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with arguments '{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }'
```  

The tool name (`profile_for_tiktok_v3`) and the argument `""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""` precisely match between the required and invoked API calls. Although there are additional tool calls invoked by the model (`user_videos_for_tiktok_v3`, `Finish`), this does not affect the success of Objective 2 because they are unnecessary calls that do not conflict with the required tool calls. Meeting the expectations for the required API calls, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer given by the model was:  
```plaintext
TikTok Profile Analysis for @the_beautyofcinema:
?? Profile Details:
- User ID: 7073509889447855110
- Username: the_beautyofcinema
- Nickname: the_beautyofcinema

?–¼ï¸?Profile Images:
- Large Avatar: Available
- Medium Avatar: Available
- Thumbnail Avatar: Available

? ï? Note: While I retrieved your profile information, the current API response limited the detailed video and engagement metrics. For a comprehensive engagement analysis, I recommend:
1. Checking your TikTok Creator Studio for precise analytics
2. Reviewing individual video performances manually
3. Using TikTok's native analytics tools for the most accurate insights
```

The data from this response aligns with the data retrieved from the `profile_for_tiktok_v3` API call, specifically user profile details like `uniqueId`, `nickname`, and avatar availability. Although `user_videos_for_tiktok_v3` returned minimal video-related insights, due to which the comprehensive analysis for engagement metrics was noted as limited, the final response used the retrieved data and correctly fulfilled the user's instruction (i.e., preparing a profile overview).

Thus, **Objective 3 is a success**."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",29,7,Success,Success,Success,"- **Expected Tool Call:**  
  `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`
  
- **Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**  
  1. `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `{}`
  2. `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `{""video_id"": 7097255034731138310}`
  3. `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `{""video_id"": 7097255034731138310}`  
  
- In this case, the required tool (`video_details_for_tiktok_api`) was successfully invoked using the correct required argument (`video_id: 7097255034731138310`) in step 2 and 3 of the model's tool calls. The presence of inconsistent or improper calls without the required argument in earlier steps is insignificant since the required call with the correct API and arguments occurred.  

---

**Objective 3: Success**  
- The model's final answer specifies that the user's instruction (helping analyze TikTok video engagement) cannot be fulfilled completely due to insufficient information about the required TikTok username and the needed trademarks like likes/comments directly. However, the model conveys the retrieved video details using proper API calls.  
- The final answer includes accurate reflection from the retrieved API data (`video_id: 7097255034731138310`, author nickname `Abbey Sharp`, and video description).  
- The final response stems directly from the API data obtained and contextually aligns with the user's request by guiding them to provide additional data. Thus, the user's instruction is reasonably fulfilled under available constraints.
  
---

**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:** The expected call (`video_details_for_tiktok_api` with correct arguments) occurred in step 2 and step 3 of the model's tool invocations. The actual behavior meets requirements despite prior irrelevant or incomplete API calls.  
- **Objective 3:** The final response rests on the data retrieved and provides the user accurate additional instructions based on unobtained engagement metrics for user `workflow`.

10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,5,0,Success,Success,Success,Reason:  "
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,10,7,Success,Success,Success,"**Objective 2**: The required API call was:
  ```plaintext

  ```
  The tool invoked by the model:
  ```plaintext
  [{""""function"""": {""""name"""": """"users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2""""
  ```
  The tool name (`users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`) matches the required tool name

  It is worth noting that the model additionally carried out secondary calls to the `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2` tool to retrieve individual user details and utilized a """"Finish"""" tool to return its final result. These additional calls do not cause failure because Objective 2 does not restrict additional irrelevant tool usage

- **Objective 3**: The user's instruction was to retrieve user profiles of the Twitter User IDs `44196397` and `155659213`. 
   1. The actual responses from the APIs contained detailed information about both IDs

11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The model correctly invoked the API call `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with the argument `{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}`, which matches the required API call `{ ""username"": ""yousuck2020"" }`. No discrepancies in arguments or tool names are present, and even though the model performed additional API calls (`users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`), that does not impact the success since only required calls need evaluation.

For Objective 3: The final answer provided by the model directly reflects the data retrieved from the API calls. The bio, follower count, and additional profile details which the user requested, including the note on the location and website, are accurately extracted and correctly stated. Thus, the user's instruction was fulfilled directly based on the tool-extracted data."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls included `search_image_for_google_search_json` for the query ""Hawaii"" and `search_web_for_google_search_json` for the query ""weather forecast in Hawaii."" However, the model neither invoked these required tools nor provided the appropriate arguments. Instead, it used the `Finish` function with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`?”a tool that was not part of the required API calls. This means the expected API calls were not executed, resulting in failure for Objective 2.  
For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed because the final task (retrieving weather forecasts and beach images) was not achieved, and no suitable answer was given to the user's instruction based on proper API calls."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:** 

- The actual tool calls made by the model were as follows:
  1. **Tool name**: `location_for_g_search` with arguments `{""location_name"": ""Paris"", ""country_code"": ""FR""}`.
  2. **Tool name**: `search_for_g_search` with arguments `{""q"": ""Top 10 must-visit attractions in Paris"", ""location_name"": ""Paris,Paris,Ile-de-France,France"", ""gl"": ""FR"", ""hl"": ""en"", ""num"": ""10""}`.
  3. **Tool name**: `search_for_g_search` with arguments `{""q"": ""Best restaurants in Paris top-rated dining experiences"", ""location_name"": ""Paris,Paris,Ile-de-France,France"", ""gl"": ""FR"", ""hl"": ""en"", ""num"": ""10""}`.

- The only expected API call was:
  - **Tool name**: `search_for_g_search` with arguments `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}`.

- Comparing these, the second tool call (using `""q"": ""Top 10 must-visit attractions in Paris""`) is semantically close to searching for popular attractions in Paris, which would qualify as correct with leniency in language interpretation. However, it included additional unnecessary arguments, such as `location_name`, and diverged slightly in phrasing (`""Top 10 must-visit attractions in Paris""` differs meaningfully from the generic `""popular attractions in Paris""` as per required arguments). This difference invalidates it in terms of compliance.

- The model failed to invoke the exact tool call as required. Thus, **Objective 2 failed**.

- As **Objective 2 failed**, the result for **Objective 3** is directly a failure as well, regardless of the final answer provided by the model, as the expected results were not fully derived from the required API calls."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  

1. **Objective 2 Analysis**: The required tool call was `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {
     ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""
   }
   ```  
   The actual tool call included `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {
     ""trackingnumber"": ""NY323068998GB""
   }
   ```  
   Here:
   - The tool name matches: `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'`.
   - The argument names `""trackingNumber""` (expected) and `""trackingnumber""` (invoked) semantically align even though the case differs, which falls within acceptable parameters for evaluation.
   - The argument value `""NY323068998GB""` is correct in both cases.

   Even though additional tools ('packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2', 'Finish') were invoked by the model, we do not mark the model down since the evaluation is focused on whether all required API calls were made. Hence, it is a **Success for Objective 2**.

2. **Objective 3 Analysis**: The final response provided by the model to the user was:  
   ```
   I was unable to retrieve tracking details for the number NY323068998GB. The carrier detection suggests two possible carriers:
   1. Royal Mail
   2. UBI Logistics

   However, no tracking information is currently available. Possible reasons:
   - The tracking number might be incorrect
   - The package may not have been processed yet
   - There could be a delay in the tracking system

   I recommend:
   - Double-checking the tracking number
   - Waiting a short time and trying again
   - Contacting the sender or carrier directly for more information
   ```  
   This response is congruent with the data retrieved from the API calls:  
   - Carrier detection correctly returned ""Royal Mail"" and ""UBI Logistics"", which is included in the final response.
   - The tracking info check did not return package details (`""response"": ""{}""`), which is reflected in the explanation.  

   Since the response was based on API results and aligns with the user's instructions (attempted carrier detection and package tracking), this is a **Success for Objective 3**."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call was `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{ ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB"" }`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model is `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{ ""trackingnumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`.   
The argument ""trackingnumber"" used by the model does not match the key ""trackingNumber"" specified in the required API call. While the values match semantically, the difference in the case of the key violates strict correctness rules and results in a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure since Objective 2 failed. The model, therefore, did not accurately use the tool as required to achieve the user's intent. While the model did provide final output, it does not achieve success based on the correct API structure."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool call is `{'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""jackie""\n  }'}`. However, the model did not invoke this tool call at all. Instead, the model invoked the `Finish` tool with arguments related to providing an informational answer. As the required tool call was not executed, Objective 2 fails. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails, as the model failed to achieve the user's instruction, which was to retrieve followers' details by invoking the required API. Instead of successfully fulfilling the request, the final answer required data retrieval, which did not occur."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

- For **Objective 2**, the actual tool call made by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}'`. The expected tool call is `'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2'` with arguments `'{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}'`. These do not match at all either in tool name or in purpose. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.

- For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 has failed and the expected API call was not made, the model did not retrieve the required data to fulfill the user's query (required rental Zestimate and comparable properties info). Additionally, the model's ""Finish"" invocation explicitly indicates that it gave up without producing a final answer based on API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call required the use of the `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` API with arguments `{""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750""}`.  
The tool call made by the model differs significantly from the required tool call. The model called the `'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search'` API with arguments `{""location"": ""New York, NY"", ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""min_bedroom"": 1, ""max_bedroom"": 3, ""min_price"": 1000, ""max_price"": 10000, ""page"": 1}`. The `""location""` parameter does not match the required value `""12750""`, and additional, unnecessary fields (e.g., `""min_bedroom""`, `""max_bedroom""`, `""min_price""`) were included. Despite additional parameters being acceptable as per guidance, the mismatch of the crucial `""location""` argument constitutes a failure.  

For Objective 3, when Objective 2 fails, it inherently leads to the failure of Objective 3. Moreover, the final response?”providing general information based on a location different from the specified Jared?”isn't aligned with the user's requirement, which is a targeted rental property search for `""12750""`. Thus, the user's instruction isn?™t successfully fulfilled."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",3,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call was:  
`{'name': 'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data', 'arguments': '{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0""}'}`  

The actual tool calls by the model included:  
* `'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data'` with arguments `{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0""}`  

The tool name matched exactly with the required API call, as did all required parameter names and values. The model invoked the tool with the correct arguments to fetch property data for San Jose, CA with an offset of `0`. Therefore, Objective 2 is deemed successful.  

For Objective 3:  
The model effectively provided the user with the retrieved API response by constructing the final answer. The model retrieved a sample property listing for San Jose, CA, outlining details including the address, listing price, and associated real estate office information. This matches the result rebased on data obtained via the API. The final statement also recommends specifying the city and state for further refinement, aligning with the instruction. Therefore, the user's request was satisfied, and Objective 3 is deemed successful."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,6,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are as follows:  
- `'time_zone_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'time_zones_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `{}`  
2. `'countries_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `{}`  
3. `'time_zones_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `{}`  
4. `'Finish'` with arguments providing a ""final answer"".  

The expected API call `'time_zone_for_geodb_cities'` with its specific argument (`""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""`) was not invoked. Instead, other tools, such as `'time_zones_for_geodb_cities'` and `'countries_for_geodb_cities'`, were called, which are unrelated to and do not fulfill the expected API requirements. Hence, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure based on the rules provided. Additionally, the model's final answer is based on its own reasoning about known North American time zones and not based on the required API call, meaning it does not meet the user's instruction to gather specific details for North American time zones from the data of the expected API call. This further confirms a failure for Objective 3."

Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"- The actual tool call performed by the model was:  
  - **'country_details_for_referential_db'** with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""DE""}`  
- The required API call was:  
  - **'country_details_for_referential_db'** with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""DE""}`  
- The argument key `countrycode` differs in spelling/case from the expected `countryCode`. Even though they appear semantically related, strict adherence to correct naming conventions is required, hence the mismatch results in failure.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer Objective 3 is also a failure. The final answer relies on API data communication, and the inconsistency in parameters for the first API call compromises this retrieval process, making the result unreliable."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The tools invoked by the model include:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countrycode"": ""QA""}'`  
  2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{""countrycode"": ""QA""}'`  

- The required API calls are:  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }'`  
  2. `'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }'`  

Analysis:  
- The tool names match exactly.  
- The argument names (`""countrycode""` vs `""countryCode""`) differ in capitalization but are semantically the same, and the values `""QA""` match perfectly.  
- Therefore, both tool calls are correct, and the model executed all required API calls accurately.

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer provided by the model includes detailed information about Qatar: country details, region, capital, timezone, listed cities with coordinates, language, currency, and country code for phone calls.  
- This answer aligns with and utilized the information retrieved from the relevant tool calls. No information was made up independently of the correct API responses.  
- The user's instruction (to provide travel-related details about Qatar for planning) is fully addressed.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API calls were:
- `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{ ""countryCode"": ""JP"" }'`
- `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{ ""countryCode"": ""JP"" }'`

The actual tool calls made by the model are:
- `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{ ""countrycode"": ""JP"" }'`
- `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `'{ ""countrycode"": ""JP"" }'`

The tool names and arguments serve the same purpose. The slight difference in the casing of `""countryCode""` versus `""countrycode""` does not affect the semantic meaning and is acceptable given the outlined evaluation rules. Thus, the model invoked all required tools with appropriate arguments, resulting in success for Objective 2.

For Objective 3: The final answer competently fulfills the user?™s instruction by providing comprehensive country details for Japan and listing sample states/prefectures obtained through API calls (as observed in the tools' responses). Since the final answer accurately derives data from these tool calls and addresses the user's requirement effectively, it leads to a success for Objective 3."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- **Tools Invoked by the Model**: The model invoked `'get_photos_for_realtor_search'` with the arguments `'{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}'`.  
- **Expected API Calls**: The required API call was `'get_photos_for_realtor_search'` with the arguments:  
  ```
  {
    ""property_id"": ""2215556385""
  }
  ```
- **Comparison**: The tool name and the required arguments match exactly. There are no discrepancies. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success for this case.  

For Objective 3:  
- The model's final response states:  
  ```
  ""Unfortunately, I could not retrieve photos for the property ID 2215556385. The system indicates the property is not available. You may want to verify the property ID or search for the property again.""
  ```
- From the tool's response to the invoked call of `'get_photos_for_realtor_search'`, the system indeed indicates that the provided property ID is not valid or available. The final answer correctly reflects this information based on the API response and honestly conveys the status to the user.  

As the final response aligns with the API response and fulfills the user's instruction within the given limitations, Objective 3 is a success."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:** The required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', 'arguments': '{\n  ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""\n  }'}  
```  
The tool calls actually invoked by the model are:  
1. `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments:
```json
{ ""query"": ""New York romantic restaurants"", ""region"": ""US"", ""limit"": 5 }
```  
2. `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'` with arguments:
```json
{ ""query"": ""fine dining restaurants in Manhattan"", ""region"": ""US"", ""limit"": 5 }
```  

There are substantial differences between the required and actual arguments for the `query` parameter. Instead of the expected value `restaurants, NY, USA`, the model used `New York romantic restaurants` and `fine dining restaurants in Manhattan`. These deviations indicate that the actual tool calls did not strictly align with the required API calls. Since `query` parameter does not correctly match the requirement, **Objective 2 is a failure**.

**Objective 3:** Given that Objective 2 failed, it is also directly inferred that Objective 3 is a failure because the tool calls were incorrect. The final answer provided general recommendations that did not result from valid or correct API call data. Moreover, the response relied on fabricated knowledge rather than any valid data retrieved from the API. Additionally, technical errors in connecting with the tools were explicitly stated, contributing to the inability to properly fulfill the user instruction."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
The required API calls are:  
1. `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`  
2. `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""petId"": ""1""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'loginuser_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""username"": ""user1"", ""password"": ""password1""}`  
2. `'getpetbyid_for_pet_store'` with arguments `{""petid"": 1}`  

The first tool call fails as the model used an incorrect username and password (`""user1"", ""password1""` instead of `""johnsmith"", ""password123""`). While the second tool call used the correct tool name, the argument name does not match?”`""petid""` instead of `""petId""`, making it technically incorrect as per instructions.  

Thus, the model failed in accurately following the required API calls.

For **Objective 3**: Since the required tool calls were not executed correctly (Objective 2 fails), the final answer by the model is invalid, as we cannot trust the information retrieved matches the user's objectives. Moreover, the model's final response originated from incorrect API calls and cannot fulfill the user's instruction comprehensively."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'title_similars_for_netflix_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""id"": ""81040344""\n  }'}
```  
However, the model made the following tool calls during this interaction:  
1. **'title_details_for_netflix_data'** with arguments:  
   ```json
   '{""ids"": ""80990668""}'
   ```
2. **'title_similars_for_netflix_data'** with arguments:  
   ```json
   '{""is_id"": ""80990668"", ""limit"": ""10"", ""offset"": ""0""}'
   ```
3. **'title_details_for_netflix_data'** with arguments:  
   ```json
   '{""ids"": ""80241947,81351555,81212077,81465380""}'
   ```

The required API was to call **'title_similars_for_netflix_data'** with the argument **""id"": ""81040344""**, but the model passed the argument **""is_id"": ""80990668""** instead. This is a mismatch in both the key name and crucial value (`81040344` vs. `80990668`). As precision in matching required arguments is essential, this leads to a **failure for Objective 2**.

For **Objective 3**, since the required API call was not executed accurately (Objective 2 failure), the user's original instruction to find similar shows to **'Squid Game'** based on the required API call has not been fulfilled by the system. Additionally, the final response appears accurately generated based on some tool calls completed by the model (like ""title_similars_for_netflix_data"") but does not follow the specified required API input. Therefore, **Objective 3 fails.**"
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is:  
- Name: `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database`

  Arguments: `{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""is_id"": ""nm1508003"", ""currentcountry"": ""US"" }`  

Upon comparison:
- The tool name is correct.
- However, the required argument is `""id"": ""nm1508003""`, whereas the actual argument is `""is_id"": ""nm1508003""`. The argument key mismatch makes the argument semantically invalid, as they are not close substitutes or capturing the same information based on naming conventions.
- Although there are additional parameters such as `""currentcountry"": ""US""`, those do not affect the correctness. The main issue is the key mismatch between `""id""` and `""is_id""`.

Thus, the actual tool call does not exactly align with the required API call.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. This means the response provided in the final answer may not be trustworthy, as it might not correctly rely on data retrieved through the tool or might not fulfill the user's requested intent."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",3,1,Failure,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is `{ ""name"": ""actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database"", ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""month\"": \""7\"",\n  \""day\"": \""27\""\n  }"" }`. The model executed the tool call with `name: actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` and the arguments `{""month"": 7, ""day"": 27}`. Although the exact formatting of the arguments was different (without the quotation marks around the numbers), the semantic meaning is the same, and ?œJuly 27th"" is conveyed correctly. Therefore, this matches the requirement, and additional functions like `Finish` do not impact the success of matching required tools.

For **Objective 3**, the model provided the final answer:  
*""On July 27th, there are 25 actors and actresses listed in the online movie database. The result includes their unique name identifiers. To get their specific names, you would need an additional lookup function or tool that can convert these name IDs into readable names. If you're interested in a specific day in July, please provide the exact day (1-31), and I can help you retrieve the list of actors and actresses born on that day.""*  

The model accurately incorporated the results (`25 actors and actresses` and the explanation regarding the name identifiers being unique IDs) retrieved from the API call. The response effectively fulfilled the user's request, considering their ambiguous input, while explaining that a specific lookup tool is needed for additional details. Hence, it satisfies the condition for **Objective 3**."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- Required API Call: `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"",
  ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""
}
```
- Actual Tool Calls: The model failed to invoke the `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` tool anywhere in its responses. Instead, it deferred the task with the assumed function `Finish` due to missing information. Since the required API call is not invoked, Objective 2 is a **failure**.

For Objective 3:  
The model states that it cannot proceed with the user's instructions due to insufficient information, and no final substantive answer to the user's query is provided. Moreover, based on the rule mentioned, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically inferred as a failure. However, even independently evaluated, the final reply from the model does not achieve the user's instruction and confesses an inability to meet the request. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the expected tool call is `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with the argument `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`. However, the actual tool calls made by the model include `stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2` and `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, which are not the required or expected tool. Additionally, the required tool `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` was not invoked at all. This mismatch between the required and actual tool calls renders Objective 2 as a failure.  

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed (i.e., the expected tool was not called, and thus correct data was not retrieved), it results in Objective 3 failing as well. While the model provides a final answer, this answer does not derive from the expected API call `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`. The failure to adhere to the required tool makes the retrieval of the relevant data invalid."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  - The required API call is:  
    ```  
    {'name': 'exchange_for_currency_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""base"": ""USD"",\n ""to"": ""EUR""\n  }'}  
    ```  
  - The model invoked the tool:  
    ```  
    {'function': {'name': 'exchange_for_currency_v2', 'arguments': '{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""int"": ""1""}'}}  
    ```  
    Comparison: The tool name `exchange_for_currency_v2` matches, and the required arguments `base` (""USD"") and `to` (""EUR"") are correctly supplied. Although the tool call includes an additional argument (`int: ""1""`), per our guidance, this does not affect the correctness as the required arguments are correct. Hence, this is considered a success for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  - The final answer was:  
    ```  
    ""For your European family vacation, here's the current currency exchange rate:  
       
    ?’± 1 USD = 0.95 EUR (as of Dec 09, 2024)  
       
    This means for every US dollar you exchange, you'll receive approximately 0.95 Euros. Some practical examples:  
    - $100 USD would convert to about ??5  
    - $500 USD would convert to about ??75  
    - $1,000 USD would convert to about ??50  
       
    Pro tip: Exchange rates can fluctuate, so it's always good to check the rate closer to your travel date and compare rates at different exchange services to get the best deal.""  
    ```  
    - The model successfully used the data retrieved by the `exchange_for_currency_v2` tool call (e.g., the exchange rate `1 USD = 0.95 EUR`, timestamp, etc.). The response meets the user's instruction of providing the USD-to-EUR exchange rate for their family vacation. Since the final answer is based on the tool's output and fulfills the user's query, this is a success for Objective 3."

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. This is because the final response may not be guaranteed to strictly rely on the retrieved data from the expected API calls if they were not made correctly."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{
""symbol"": ""BTC"",
""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
""base"": ""USDT""
}'}  
```

The model invoked the tool:  
```  
'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with '{
  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
  ""base"": ""USDT"",
  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
  ""gran"": ""1d"",
  ""expiration"": ""perpetual""
}'  
```  

Although the actual API call has additional arguments (`""gran"": ""1d""` and `""expiration"": ""perpetual""`), these additions do not alter the intention of fetching futures data for BTC/USDT on Binance with the specified criteria. Therefore, the actual API call fulfills the requirements of the expected API call. Based on this, **Objective 2 is a success**.

For **Objective 3**, the final output presents the retrieved cryptocurrency futures market data from the API call in a meaningful way. The details of the futures data (daily OHLCV metrics, trades count, VWAP, price volatility observations, and trading activity summary) match the data fetched via the API. It also successfully meets the user's request for futures market data. The model completed the task by generating the final answer based on the API response and elaborating on the details explicitly retrieved from the API. Thus, **Objective 3 is a success**."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected tool call is:  
- `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with `{ ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"" }`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with `{ ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""sort"": ""asc"", ""accept"": ""application/json"" }`

The tool name matches perfectly, and all required arguments overlap semantically:
1. `symbol` = ""BTC"" is correct.  
2. `market_venue` = ""BINANCE"" aligns.  
3. `start` = ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"" matches.  
4. `base` = ""USDT"" is correctly specified.  

Additional parameters like `gran`, `sort`, and `accept` do not affect correctness. Therefore, it succeeds for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, the data retrieved from the tool call (e.g., Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, VWAP, and Trades) is used effectively to provide a detailed breakdown of all key metrics for the daily spot market data from May 5th to May 8th. The final answer summarizes the provided metrics accurately and aligns with the requirement.  
Therefore, it is a success for Objective 3."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call requires the tool `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `{""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY""}`. However, the actual tool usage by the model shows a tool invocation of the same name but with arguments `'{}'` instead, which is incorrect as it does not include the required ""is_from"" and ""to"" arguments. The discrepancy in arguments invalidates this tool call. Although other tools were called by the model (`'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'`), these are additional and do not fulfill the required call precisely. This results in failure for Objective 2.

Due to the failure of Objective 2, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure, as the incorrect or missing tool invocation means the final answer could not be properly based on the API's intended data. Additionally, while the final answer provided detailed exchange rates and travel tips, it does not align with the prescribed requirements that depend on correct retrieval via the API calls. Therefore, the model fails to fulfill Objective 3."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
`{'name': 'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api', 'arguments': '{""country"": ""Philippines""}'}`.  
The model, however, invoked the following tool call:  
`{'name': 'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api', 'arguments': '{""country"": ""Philippines""}'}`.  

Here, the `name` of the tool invoked, `""esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api""`, is not the same as the required tool name, `""query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api""`. Since the tool name does not match as required, Objective 2 is considered a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. As such, even though the model gave a final answer based on a technical API issue and linguistic explanations, it still did not achieve the user?™s instruction (to retrieve sites from a valid API response)."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",12,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:   
- Tool name: `properties_list_for_idealista_v2`  
- Arguments: `{ ""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003"" }`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `auto_complete_for_idealista_v2` with arguments: `{ ""prefix"": ""Lisbon"", ""country"": ""pt"" }`  
2. `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments: `{ ""operation"": ""rent"", ""country"": ""pt"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-PT-11-06"", ""locale"": ""en"", ""maxitems"": 20 }`  
3. `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments: `{ ""operation"": ""rent"", ""country"": ""pt"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-PT-11-06"", ""locationname"": ""Lisboa, Lisboa"", ""locale"": ""en"", ""maxitems"": 20 }`  
4. `properties_detail_for_idealista_v2` with arguments: `{ ""propertycode"": 33960506, ""country"": ""pt"", ""language"": ""en"" }`

6. `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments: `{ ""operation"": ""rent"", ""country"": ""pt"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-PT-11-06"", ""locationname"": ""Lisboa, Lisboa"", ""locale"": ""en"", ""maxitems"": 20, ""propertytype"": ""homes"", ""minprice"": 300, ""maxprice"": 2000 }`

### **Analysis:**  
- The tool name, `properties_list_for_idealista_v2`, is invoked in several tool calls, which partially matches the expectation.  
- However, the argument required, `""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""`, does NOT match any of the `locationid` values used in these tool calls, where `""locationid""` is `""0-EU-PT-11-06""` instead.  
- Furthermore, the `""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal""`, differs semantically from `""locationname"": ""Lisboa, Lisboa""`, which breaks the requirement as they are not synonyms for the specified matching layers.  
Since the **arguments do not match**, the required API call has not been accurately fulfilled.

Thus, **Objective 2** is marked a **Failure**.  

---

For **Objective 3**, the rule states that if **Objective 2 fails**, **Objective 3 must also fail** by direct inference. Moreover, while the model provides a final answer intending to summarize a property search result within Lisbon, it does so using API calls that failed specific requirements, exhibiting incorrect usage. Without fulfillment of the proper API data, the provided summary cannot be trusted as achieving the user's actual instruction.

Thus, **Objective 3** is also marked a **Failure**."

40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call is `'club_profile_for_transfermarket'` with the argument `{'id': '985'}`, but the actual tool call made by the model was `'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with the arguments `{""is_id"": 985, ""domain"": ""com""}`. Though the tool names may seem related, the discrepancies in the name and argument structure are significant (e.g., `is_id` instead of `id`, and the inclusion of an unnecessary `""domain""` argument). This mismatch means the Objective 2 evaluation fails.  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 also fails automatically, as the expected information retrieval cannot be guaranteed."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. **For Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
   - Name: `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket`  
   - Arguments: `{ ""id"": ""28003"" }`  

   However, the actual invoked tool calls made by the model are:  
   - Name: `players_get_header_info_for_transfermarket`  
     Arguments: `{""domain"": ""com"", ""is_id"": 28003}`
   - Name: `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket`  
     Arguments: `{""domain"": ""com"", ""is_id"": 28003}`  

   The actual tool invocation of `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` uses the argument `""is_id"": 28003` while the required argument is `""id"": ""28003""`. This mismatch between `""is_id""` and `""id""` leads to a **failure in Objective 2**, even though the model attempted to access Messi's profile. Additionally, the model invoked the tool `players_get_header_info_for_transfermarket`, which was unnecessary.  

2. **For Objective 3**, since Objective 2 has failed, we can directly infer that the final answer does not achieve the task based on the required API calls. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **failure** as well."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,4,0,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason:**   

For **Objective 2**, we need to validate whether the required API call matches the actual tool invocations by the model.  
The **required API call** is:  
`transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""competitionids"": ""GB1"",
  ""clubids"": ""985""
}
```  

The **actual tool call** sparkline `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` was invoked twice by the model, the second call matches exactly:  
`transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""competitionids"": ""GB1"",
  ""clubids"": ""985"",
  ""domain"": ""com""
}
```  
The addition of ""domain"": ""com"" as a parameter does not impact correctness because it does not deviate the semantic intent of the required API. Therefore, Objective 2 is considered successful.

---

For **Objective 3**, we evaluate whether the final answer complies with the instruction based on the data retrieved from the APIs:  

1. The model retrieves Manchester United's transfer rumors correctly through the `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` tool. Mentioning `Gregor Kobel`'s rumor as:        
   - Club: Borussia Dortmund  
   - Potential Transfer to: Manchester United  
   - Probability: 29%  
   - Market Value: ??0M  
This information matches the relevant API response.

2. The final answer provided is:  
```
Current Transfer Rumors for Manchester United:

1. Gregor Kobel (Goalkeeper)
- From: Borussia Dortmund
- Transfer Probability: 29%
- Estimated Market Value: ??0 million
- Current Position: Goalkeeper
- Nationality: Swiss

The rumor suggests Manchester United is considering signing Gregor Kobel, a Swiss goalkeeper currently playing for Borussia Dortmund. The transfer has a moderate probability of happening, with an estimated market value of ??0 million. Please note that transfer rumors are speculative and may not necessarily result in an actual transfer.
```

The information aligns with the retrieved data and fulfills the instruction to summarize transfer gossip for Manchester United. The model uses API data effectively and avoids generating unsupported information. Therefore, **Objective 3 is successful.**"
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
- **Required API call:** `{ 'name': 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider', 'arguments': '{\n ""domain"": ""AR"",\n ""locale"": ""es_ar"",\n ""hotel_id"": ""1105156""\n }' }`
- **Actual tool calls invoked by the model:**  
  1. `{ 'name': 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider', 'arguments': '{""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"": ""es_ar"", ""hotel_id"": 1105156}' }`  
  2. After correcting the error, another call was made:  
      `{ 'name': 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider', 'arguments': '{""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"": ""es_AR"", ""hotel_id"": 1105156}' }`.

  While the initial API call gave an incorrect locale format (`es_ar`), it matches the **required API call**. Furthermore, when the assistant detected the error in the response, it correctly retried with a minimally adjusted argument format (`es_AR`) to align with the required service input.  
  - Since both include `name = hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider` and the correct arguments `{ ""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"" = ""es_ar/es_AR"", ""hotel_id"" = ""1105156"" }`, **Objective 2 is considered successful.**

**Objective 3:**
- The final response points out that while the API successfully retrieved information, the hotel they identified, ?œHotel Roma Prague,??is located in Prague (Czech Republic) instead of Argentina as requested. Since the user's original instruction clearly refers to a hotel in **Argentina**, this contradicts the requirement.
- Additionally, the **final_answer** does not include any valid details about hotels in Argentina ??it provides irrelevant/incorrect information instead. Therefore, **the model failed to achieve the user's instructions for a specific hotel in Argentina**."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,5,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Comparison of tool calls (Objective 2)**:  
   Required API calls:  
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR"" }`  
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT"" }`  
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{ ""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES"" }`  

   Actual tool calls by the model:  
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`  
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""DE""}`  
   - `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""GB""}`  

   The model made the correct call for destination `""FR""`, but it failed to call for two required destinations (`""IT""` and `""ES""`). Instead, it made incorrect tool calls for `""DE""` and `""GB""`, which did not match the required API endpoints. Thus, the tool calls did not fulfill the required API specifications.  

2. **Final Answer (Objective 3)**:  
   Since Objective 2 failed, it implies that the required data for destinations `""IT""` and `""ES""` were not retrieved. The final answer also focuses primarily on `""FR""`, `""DE""`, and `""GB""`, ignoring the mandated destinations `""IT""` and `""ES""`. Therefore, the user's instruction to cover these specific destinations was not achieved based on the API calls. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call was `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `'{""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000}'`, but the model invoked `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `'{""is_from"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": ""1000""}'`. The actual tool call had a mismatch in both the source currency (`JPY` was required, but `USD` was used by the model), and there is a parameter name change from `from` to `is_from`, making it incorrect semantically. Since the model did not execute this specific API call as required, Objective 2 fails.  

- **Objective 3**: Given that Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer Objective 3 also fails. The failure to retrieve and use the correct API call invalidates the final answer provided by the model."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",37,4,Success,**Failure**,**Failure**,"- **Required API Call**:  
  `'name': 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days', 'arguments': '{ ""city"": ""London"" }'`  

- **Actual API Call**:  
  `'name': 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days', 'arguments': '{}'`  

The tool name invoked by the model matches the expected tool (`search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days`). However, the argument provided by the model (`{}`) does not match the required argument (`{ ""city"": ""London"" }`). The required field to specify the `city` parameter was missing, which results in a **failure**.

---

**Objective 3**: **Failure**  
**Reason**:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The model's final output does not successfully fulfill the user's instructions due to the incorrect API call. Without the required argument (`city: ""London""`), the subsequent processes could not fetch the relevant 14-day weather forecast, leading to the eventual repeated failures and a response stating that the system encountered technical difficulties."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 

For Objective 2, the tool invoked by the model is `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `'{""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10""}'`. The required API call was `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments `'{""base"": ""USD"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}'`. The tool name matches exactly, and all the required arguments are present and correctly specified with the same values, although in a different order, which is acceptable. Therefore, it achieves success for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the model's final response successfully provides an analysis of the historical gold rates within the specified date range, based on the data retrieved from the API call. The model mentions the period, fluctuation range, and prices per ounce during this time, all derived from the tool's response. This satisfies the user's instruction, leading to a success for Objective 3."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call was `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the argument for date specified as ""2024-01-15"". However, the model invoked a different tool, `get_football_live_scores_today_for_football_score_api`, without the required date argument. Since the required tool and its arguments were not used, Objective 2 fails. For Objective 3, as Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer was based on the failure to retrieve scores instead of fulfilling the user's instruction of providing match scores for a specified date. The response instead asked for more details without achieving the user's instruction."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required tool call was:
  ```python
  {'name': 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator', 'arguments': '{\n  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",\n  ""variable"": ""x""\n }'}
  ```
  - The model invoked the following tool calls:  
    1. `'name': 'validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with `'arguments': '{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1""}'`.  
    2. `'name': 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with `'arguments': '{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'`.  
    3. `'name': 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with `'arguments': '{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""y""}'`.  
    4. `'name': 'Finish'` to provide the final answer.  

While the tool `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` was called with the correct arguments for differentiating with respect to `""x""`, it is also coupled with *unnecessary extra tool calls* like validation and differentiation with respect to `""y""` (i.e., API calls that are not required in this task). Hence, Objective 2 is considered a **failure**.

- Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly conclude that Objective 3 also failed, despite the model providing correct derivatives and explanations, as the incorrect execution undermined proper adherence to the user's intended operation."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,74,9,Success,Success,Success,"`yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with arguments `{""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model included multiple calls to `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete`:
1. `{""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2023-06-01"", ""edate"": ""2024-06-01""}`
2. `{""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31""}`
3. `{""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2023-06-01"", ""edate"": ""2024-01-01""}`
4. `{""ticker"": ""TSLA"", ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31""}`
   
Among the tool calls, the model invoked `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with the exact arguments specified by the required tool call (`ticker: TSLA, sdate: 2020-01-01, edate: 2020-12-31`). Therefore, the required tool call has been invoked successfully in the course of execution. Additional tool calls by the model are permitted based on the evaluation rules and do not count against success.  

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
The user's instruction was to retrieve historical stock price data for Tesla for the year 2020. While the model invoked the correct tool with the specified parameters, it repeatedly encountered authorization errors in obtaining the data (`""Unauthorized error""`). The final response does not fulfill the user's request as the required historical stock price data is not successfully retrieved. Furthermore, the model did not provide a final answer addressing or overcoming this issue, choosing instead to retry the tools multiple times. The response does not satisfy the instruction.  

---

**Reason:**  
1. Objective 2 is a success because the expected tool (`yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete`) with the specified arguments was invoked.
2. Objective 3 is a failure since the historical stock data for the specified date range (`2020-01-01` to `2020-12-31`) was not retrieved due to consistent API errors, and the user's request was not fulfilled in the final answer. Thus, the user's instructions were not accomplished."
