1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",2,Failure,Success**,Success**,"**Reason:**  

1. **Objective 2:**    
   - **Expected API call:**  
     `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments:   
     ```json
     {
       ""date1"": ""2023-12-01"",
       ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""
     }
     ```
   - **Actual tool call:**  
     `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments:  
     ```json
     {
       ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"",
       ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""
     }
     ```  
   - The tool name matches correctly, and the argument values (`date1` and `date2`) have the same meaning despite the slight difference in date formatting (`YYYY-MM-DD` vs. `MM-DD-YYYY`). Thus, the tool call can be considered equivalent.  
   - Since the actual tool triggered aligns semantically with the expected API call and retrieves the correct data, **Objective 2 is a success.**

2. **Objective 3:**  
   - The model presented the final answer:  
     ```  
     ""Here are the Fantasy 5 winning number sets for December 2023:  
     December 31st (Midday): 10 17 22 23 25  
     December 31st (Evening): 8 10 24 31 36  
     December 30th (Midday): 6 11 13 18 36  
     December 30th (Evening): 6 22 27 29 36  
     December 29th (Midday): 3 7 18 27 35  
     
     Note: These are the available winning number sets for the specified period. Each drawing has both a midday and evening set. The data shows the five numbers drawn for each game, listed in ascending order.""  
     ```  
   - This response is accurate and derived entirely from the data retrieved via the `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` tool call. The final output parses and summarizes the raw `tool` response effectively, fulfilling the user's instruction.  
   - Hence, **Objective 3 is a success.**"
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,2,Failure,Failure**,**,"  1. `hot_100_for_billboard` with arguments:
     ```json
     { ""date"": ""2024-02-03"" }
     ```
  2. `Finish` with arguments, which provides the final formatted answer (Not relevant for evaluation of Objective 2).
  
- **Required tool calls**:
  1. `hot_100_for_billboard` with arguments:
     ```json
     { ""date"": ""2022-07-20"" }
     ```

- **Analysis**:  
The model correctly called the `hot_100_for_billboard` tool, but the provided argument `date` is not correct. The required `date` was `""2022-07-20""`, whereas the model sent `""2024-02-03""`. This discrepancy in a required argument makes the tool call mismatched and incorrect. Thus, this fails Objective 2.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
- **Reasoning**:  
Since Objective 2 was a failure (wrong date argument used in the relevant required tool call), it invalidates the correctness of the model's resulting final answer. The data retrieved from the API does not correspond to the instructions provided by the user, as the `date` used is incorrect and likely not what was instructed by the expectation laid out in the required tool call. Additionally, the final answer directly depends on this mismatched data, making Objective 3 fail.

---

**Reason**: The model invoked the `hot_100_for_billboard` tool as required, but with a mistaken argument for `""date""` (`""2024-02-03""` instead of `""2022-07-20""`). Moreover, the final answer stems from using this incorrect tool call information, making the response irrelevant to the user's request. Thus, both objectives fail."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The expected API call was `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model included `'billboard_200_for_billboard'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2020-03-18""}`.  
This matches exactly with the required API call. Additionally, while other API calls (`'hot_100_for_billboard'` and `'artist_100_for_billboard'`) were invoked, they do not impact the correctness of achieving the expected tool call.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer provided a comprehensive summary incorporating data retrieved from the API calls, aligning it with the user's requested date ""2020-03-18."" The response was built using API-provided data, clearly fulfilling the user's request.  
- The final answer consolidated data from the ""Hot 100,"" ""Billboard 200,"" and ""Artist 100"" charts successfully and provided detailed descriptions, meeting the user's specified requirement thoroughly."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, the required API call was `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`.  
The model made the following tool calls: 
1. `{'name': 'motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
2. `{'name': 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`  
3. `{'name': 'love_quote_for_olato_quotes', 'arguments': '{}'}`  

While the expected tool `success_quote_for_olato_quotes` was invoked correctly, additional unnecessary tools like `motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes` and `love_quote_for_olato_quotes` were invoked. According to the instructions, the evaluation should still succeed if unnecessary tools are invoked, provided the expected tools are invoked correctly. However, some technical inconsistency arises: A small formatting issue exists in one retrieved output string ??namely, malformed single quotes around the `""love_quote_for_olato`) malformed "").Æ°Æ¡"
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The expected API call is:  
- `'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld'` with arguments `""{ 'keyword': 'technology', 'countryCode': 'us' }""`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'getcountrycode_for_asktheworld'` with arguments `'{}'`  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments containing `""final_answer"": ""I'm ready to help you find casual search engine questions for your research, but I need you to specify the keyword or subject of your final year project...""`  

The required tool (`getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld`) is **not invoked**, and hence the model fails to meet the requirements of Objective 2.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, we know the necessary data for answering the user's instruction was not retrieved using the required API call. Therefore, the model fails to deliver the final answer effectively based on the required information. The final output does not fulfill the user's original instruction, as the specified tool invoking ""getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld"" with correct arguments was not executed to gather relevant data required for completing the user's request."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{\n  ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"",\n  ""location"": ""New York""\n }'}  
```
However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. Tool name: `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments:
```
'{""job_title"": ""NodeJS Developer"", ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA"", ""radius"": 200}'  
```
2. Tool name: `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments:  
```
'{""job_title"": ""NodeJS Developer"", ""location"": ""San Francisco, CA, USA"", ""radius"": 200}'  
```

The required tool intends to fetch the estimated salary for a NodeJS developer located in New York, but the arguments for `location` in the actual tool call include additional specification (`New York, NY, USA, radius: 200`). Additionally, there was an invocation targeted at ""San Francisco,"" which is beyond the required argument consideration. Due to the location discrepancy between the required and actual tool calls (additional specific address and radius values was used), the invoked tool does not fully align with the expectation. As per the guidance, a discrepancy in required arguments (spelling mistakes or significant location/parameter content mismatch) results in failure.

For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer regarding the salaries based on data retrieved from its tool calls. However, as Objective 2 is already a failure (due to incorrect tool arguments), we infer that Objective 3 is also a failure because a valid final response depends on proper and accurate tool usage."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2:**  
   - **Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**  
     The model invoked the following tools:
     - `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `""job_title"": ""Entry Level Business Analyst"", ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA"", ""radius"": 50`.
     - `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `""job_title"": ""Entry Level Software Developer"", ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA"", ""radius"": 50`.
     - `'Finish'` tool to deliver the final answer.
   - **Required API Call:**  
     - `'estimated_salary_for_jsearch'` with arguments `""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""`.
   - **Comparison:**  
     The job title in the actual API calls (`""Entry Level Business Analyst""` and `""Entry Level Software Developer""`) does not match the required job title `""nodejs developer""`. Additionally, the location in the required call does not specify ""New York, NY, USA"", though the location mismatch is not penalized in this instance since it falls within ""New York"". However, the main problem lies in the job title mismatch. Therefore, Objective 2 is deemed a **failure**.

2. **Objective 3:**  
   Since Objective 2 failed, the final response cannot fulfill the user's instruction regarding salary estimation for `""nodejs developer""`. The final answer fails to address the required position and instead provides salary data for business analysts and software developers, roles unrelated to the required `""nodejs developer""`. Hence, Objective 3 is a **failure**, as the data provided does not meet the requested details."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**: The required API call is `'profile_for_tiktok_v3'` with arguments `'{\n  ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""\n  }'`, but the model did not invoke this API. Instead, the tool invoked by the model is `'Finish'`, which does not match the required API. Hence, the model failed to make the required tool call for Objective 2.

**Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 fails (the necessary API call was not made to retrieve the relevant TikTok profile information), Objective 3 also fails. The final answer provided by the model did not base its response on data retrieved through the required API and does not fulfill the user's instruction to analyze their TikTok profile. Instead, the final answer essentially asks the user to provide their username without completing the intended task."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
- **Objective 2:** The required tool call is `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `'{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}'`. However, the model did not invoke this tool. Instead, the tool call made was `'Finish'`, which is unrelated to the required tool call. As a result, the model failed to execute the required API call, leading to a failure for Objective 2.  
- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. The model did not attempt to fetch the required data from the API to fulfill the user's instruction. While it ends with a final answer stating that it requires the TikTok username to proceed, this is not based on an attempt to retrieve video details or engage with valid data, resulting in failure for Objective 3."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"The model invoked the tool `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}` multiple times. The required API call specifies `'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""}`. While there is a slight formatting difference in the spacing of arguments, the argument value (`ids`) is semantically identical. Thus, all required tool calls were correctly invoked by the model with the proper arguments.  

Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason:**  
The model invoked the necessary API calls to retrieve user information for the specified Twitter IDs successfully. However, there is no evidence of the model providing a `""final_answer""` based on these tool responses. Without a final response explicitly fulfilling the user instruction, the overall Objective 3 fails."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** The required API call specifies the `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` tool to be used with the argument `{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}`. However, the tool invoked by the model is `Finish` and it does not relate to the required API. The intended API, `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2`, was not invoked at all, leading to a failure for Objective 2.
- **Objective 3:** Since the required API call was not invoked (Objective 2 failed), it is impossible for the model?™s final answer to fulfill the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure. Furthermore, the final answer is a generic response asking for the username and does not adequately address the user's requirements to retrieve the exact profile details (bio, follower count, and location). This fails to complete the user's request."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required tool calls were:  
1. `'search_image_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{\n  ""q"": ""Hawaii""\n  }'`  
2. `'search_web_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{\n  ""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""\n  }'`  

The model only called `'Finish'` which is not among the required tools. None of the expected tool calls was invoked, so the model fails Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the provided final answer asked the user for more input and did not fulfill the user's original instruction (finding the weather forecast and beach images). Therefore, Objective 3 fails independently."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected API call was `search_for_g_search` with arguments `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}`. However, the model did not invoke this tool; instead, it only invoked `Finish`, signaling the finalization of an answer without using the required tool call. As the required tool call was missing, Objective 2 is a failure.  
For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, it directly implies failure for Objective 3. Additionally, the model's so-called final response only asked for more input instead of fulfilling the user?™s instruction, which still fails the user?™s requirement, even if evaluated independently."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For *Objective 2*, the expected tool call is `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`, but the model invoked the tool `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""I'm unable to track your package without a tracking number. Please provide me with the specific tracking number, and optionally the carrier if you know it. I'll be happy to help you track your package once I have those details.""}`. The expected tool was not invoked, and the required semantic outcomes based on expected input were not met. Therefore, *Objective 2* is a failure.  

For *Objective 3*, the final answer provided is `""I'M unable to track your package without a tracking number...""`, which indicates the model failed in meeting the user's request to track the package using APIs. Furthermore, because *Objective 2* is a failure, by rule, *Objective 3* is inherently a failure."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:    
- The expected tool call is `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`. This call intends to retrieve the carrier details for a specific tracking number.  
- However, the model made a single tool call `Finish` with the arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""I need the tracking number to help you find the carrier details and track the package. Please provide the tracking number, and I'll assist you right away.""}`.   
- The required tool `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` was not invoked, which makes Objective 2 a failure.  

For Objective 3:    
- The user's instruction was not fulfilled as the model did not provide the details of the carrier or tracking status, which are dependent on calling the required API `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`. Instead, the model responded that it needed the tracking number, even though it was already instructed to match a specific required API call.    
- Since objective 1 failed and the final response is irrelevant without fulfilling this requirement, Objective 3 is also a failure."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected API call was: 
- `{'name': 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro', 'arguments': '{\n  ""username"": ""jackie""\n  }'}`.  

The tool that was actually invoked by the model was: 
- `{'name': 'Finish', 'arguments': '{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""I can help you retrieve the list of followers for an Instagram account. However, I need you to provide the specific username whose followers you want to retrieve. Could you please share the exact Instagram username? Once you provide the username, I\'ll use the Instagram Pro tool to fetch up to 1000 followers, including their usernames, full names, and profile information.""}'}`.

The required tool, `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro`, was never invoked by the model, and additionally, the necessary parameter `""username""` with the value `""jackie""` was not passed. Because the invoked tool is entirely unrelated to the expected one, **Objective 2 fails**.

For **Objective 3**, the final result provided by the model was:
- `""I can help you retrieve the list of followers for an Instagram account. However, I need you to provide the specific username whose followers you want to retrieve...""`. 

The model fails to achieve the user's instruction, which explicitly required retrieving the follower list for the username ""jackie."" Moreover, since the required API call was not invoked (Objective 2 failure), the given answer could not be derived from any API data. Hence, **Objective 3 also fails**."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call was `'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2'` with arguments `""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""`. However, no actual API call with the same or equivalent tool name or parameters was invoked by the model. Instead, the model used the `Finish` tool to request a specific address for a rental Zillow search, which does not fulfill the required API call specification. As a result, Objective 2 is a failure.  
For Objective 3, since Objective 2 was a failure and there was no alignment between the API call and the user's instruction, we directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model did not use appropriate API data to deliver the user's requirements and instead requested additional information from the user."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call specifies the use of the `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` tool with the arguments: ```{ ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750"" }```. However, the model instead invoked `auto_complete_for_realtor_search` with unmatched intent and no invocation of the necessary `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` tool. This constitutes a failure since the required tool wasn't called.  
- **Objective 3**: Since the required API call wasn't executed (`search_for_rent_for_realtor_search`), the methodology described by the assistant was incomplete, and the final response from the model does not fulfill the user's requirement to find rental properties within a specific location (e.g., ""12750""). Consequently, Objective 3 also fails."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The invoked tool by the model was `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data` with arguments `{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0""}`. This fully matches the required API call name and its matching arguments specified as `{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0""}` even specif }}["
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The expected tool call was `'time_zone_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `{ ""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles"" }`.
- The actual tool calls made by the model were:
  1. `'time_zones_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `{}`.
  2. `'time_zone_date_time_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}`.
  3. `'time_zone_date_time_for_geodb_cities'` with arguments `{""zoneid"": ""America__New_York""}`.
  4. `'Finish'` invoked with argument `'{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""...""}'`. 
- The expected tool call was neither identical to nor effectively invoked by the actual tool calls. While a similar-sounding tool `'time_zone_date_time_for_geodb_cities'` was invoked with the required `zoneid` value, the name of the tool is not an exact match to `'time_zone_for_geodb_cities'`. Partial name matching cannot guarantee they serve interchangeable purposes. Thus, Objective 2 failed.
- Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also automatically failed. This is because the conclusion that the time zones mentioned in the final response are derived from relevant API calls also cannot hold."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **For Objective 2**: The model failed to invoke the required API call.  
   - Required tool call: `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{\n  ""countryCode"": ""DE""\n  }`.  
   - Tools invoked by the model: 
     - `'countries_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{}`.
     - `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""...exploring.""}`.  
   - The model ignited tools with unrelated names (`'countries_for_referential_db'` and `'Finish'`), and neither matches the required name `'country_details_for_referential_db'` nor provides the specific `""countryCode""` argument like `""DE""`. As the invoked tool calls do not fulfill the expected requirements, the outcome for Objective 2 fails.  

- **For Objective 3**: Based on the rule, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails.  
   - Moreover, the final response asks the user to prove more specific information instead of retrieving the requested data for country `'DE'`. As a result, the user's requirement is not fulfilled."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Success**,Success,"1. **`country_details_for_referential_db`** with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`  
2. **`cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db`** with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. **`country_details_for_referential_db`** with `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`   
2. **`cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db`** with `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}` 

The slightly different casing of the argument parameter (`countryCode` vs. `countrycode`) can be deemed acceptable assuming semantic equivalence. Both tools with the required arguments were correctly invoked, ensuring Objective 2 is fulfilled.

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:** The final answer provided by the model integrates detailed, relevant information retrieved via the API calls, as evidenced by:  
- Country details (like name, capital, region, currency, coordinates) fetched from the **`country_details_for_referential_db`** tool.  
- City details (including their names and specific coordinates) fetched from the **`cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db`** tool.  

The final comprehensive response meticulously summarizes the retrieved data, reflecting the Middle Eastern region information and fulfilling the user's requirements. Thus, Objective 3 is also successful."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Expected tool calls:**  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`, and  
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`.  

- **Actual tool calls by the model:**  
  1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}`.
  2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}`.

- Analysis for Objective 2: The tool names are correct, and the required arguments are semantically equivalent despite slight differences in argument case (`countryCode` vs. `countrycode`), which is insignificant for evaluation as their meanings are the same. All the required tool calls were made, so Objective 2 is successfully achieved.
  
- Analysis for Objective 3: The model's final answer comprehensively uses the data retrieved via the API calls:
  - Details about Japan (JP) such as capital, region, subregion, currency, and coordinates were derived from the data returned by `'country_details_for_referential_db'`.  
  - The list of prefectures and coordinates relates directly to the info retrieved via `'states_for_referential_db'`.  
  This shows that the model successfully used the API responses to generate the appropriate final answer, fulfilling Objective 3."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
  ```  
  [{'name': 'get_photos_for_realtor_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""property_id"": ""2215556385""\n  }'}]  
  ```  
  However, the model did not invoke the required tool `get_photos_for_realtor_search` with the needed argument `""property_id"": ""2215556385""`. Instead, it invoked the tool `Finish` to deliver a request for additional information, which does not match the required tool call. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 has already failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. Furthermore, the model's final answer did not provide any property photos and instead asked the user for additional information. This contradicts the user's initial requirement to fetch property photos tied to a specific property. Hence, it does not fulfill the user's instruction."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The required API call specified was:  
- Tool name: `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'`  
- Expected arguments: `'{ ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA"" }'`  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. Tool name: `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'`  
   Arguments: `'{ ""query"": ""romantic fine dining restaurants"", ""limit"": 5, ""region"": ""US"" }'`  
2. Tool name: `'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'`  
   Arguments: `'{ ""query"": ""upscale romantic restaurants"", ""limit"": 5, ""language"": ""en"" }'`  

The intended query by the expected tool call `""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""` is reflective of finding general restaurants specifically in New York, USA. The arguments provided by the model, however, deviate from this intended query?”specifically regarding `""query""`, mentioning more expansive terms like `""romantic fine dining restaurants""` or other broad scopes such as `""region"": ""US""`. As such, the tool calls differ and do not meet the required API call?™s argument criteria. Therefore, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we directly infer that the model did not fulfill Objective 3. Furthermore, while the model attempted to provide general dining advice as a fallback by making final recommendations based on its understanding, this final output fails the user's original intent of finding specific restaurant suggestions using API data. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls were:  
1. `loginuser_for_pet_store` with `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`  
2. `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with `{""petId"": ""1""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `loginuser_for_pet_store` with `{""username"": ""user1"", ""password"": ""password1""}`  
2. `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with `{""petid"": 1}`  

For `loginuser_for_pet_store`, the required argument `username` is supposed to be ""johnsmith,"" while the model used ""user1."" Similarly, the required `password` is supposed to be ""password123,"" but the model used ""password1."" For `getpetbyid_for_pet_store`, the required argument pair `{""petId"": ""1""}` had cases that do not match (lowercase ""petid"" instead of ""petId""). Therefore, the API calls do not meet the required accuracy for Objective 2, and it fails.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is inferred to fail as well per the rule."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with the arguments: `{""id"": ""81040344""}`. However, the actual tool call made by the model to `title_similars_for_netflix_data` uses the argument: `{""is_id"": ""81040344"", ""limit"": ""10"", ""offset"": ""0""}`. While the additional arguments (`""limit"": ""10""` and `""offset"": ""0""`) are acceptable, the key used for the ID is `""is_id""` instead of `""id""`. Since this discrepancy indicates the critical argument does not match, Objective 2 fails.  

- **Objective 3**: The failure in Objective 2 implies the model fetched inconsistent or incorrect data due to a mismatched API call argument. Consequently, this cascades into Objective 3, causing it to fail as the final answer cannot be considered reliable (as the user's instruction to find shows similar to ""Squid Game"" is not properly achieved)."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- **Required tool call**: `'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `'{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003"" }'`.  
- **Actual tool call by the model**: `'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `'{ ""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""is_id"": ""nm1508003"", ""currentcountry"": ""US"" }'`.  

The tool name matches correctly, as well as the crucial arguments `""tconst"": ""tt10919420""` and `""id""/""is_id"": ""nm1508003""` where `""is_id""` serves the equivalent purpose of `""id""`. Although the model added the argument `""currentcountry"": ""US""`, it does not alter the intent or correctness of the tool call. Therefore, the required tool call was correctly invoked in this case.  

For Objective 3:  
- The question required extracting information about Gong Yoo's character in ""Squid Game"".  
- The retrieved API response contains information that Gong Yoo's character is ""Ddakji Man"" with details such as the actor category (`""actor""`), years active on the show (`2021-2024`), a role in 4 episodes, and providing pivotal details of the appearance.  
- The final answer presented to the user was fully based on the above API response and captured all relevant information effectively. The model achieved the user's instruction successfully using the tool data."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the expected API call is `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with arguments `{ ""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27"" }`.  

The tool invocations by the model include:  
1. `'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database'` with `{""month"": 7, ""day"": 27}`  

The model's tool call uses the same tool name, and the arguments match in meaning (even though the month and day are given as integers instead of strings, they are equivalent). Thus, this is a **Success** for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, the user's instruction was to provide a list of actors and actresses born on a specific day in July. Using the tool response, the model generated and provided a final answer summarizing actor names derived from their IDs and explicitly mentioned additional names were part of the list but couldn't be detailed without a further lookup. The answer successfully satisfies the user's request and aligns with the data retrieved from the tool calls. Thus, this is a **Success** for Objective 3."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",3,Failure,** Failure,** Failure,"**Reason:** 

For Objective 2:  
The required API call is as follows:  
- `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""}`.  

The model's actual tool calls were:  
1. `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm0001667"", ""category"": ""actor"", ""region"": ""US""}`.  
2. `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""nconst"": ""nm1716972"", ""category"": ""actor"", ""region"": ""US""}`.  

While the tool name matches, the `nconst` argument is not correct in either of the actual calls (required value is ""nm1508003""), resulting in a mismatch. Additionally, both `tconst` values used by the model do not fully align with expectations; ""tt0092455"" does appear in the first tool call but is paired with the wrong `nconst`. The second produced a completely different `tconst`. Because required arguments didn't follow the exact pattern, Objective 2 fails.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 fails, we directly infer Objective 3 fails as well. Even beyond that, the model did provide a final answer, but it acknowledged a failure in extracting the needed information, attributing this to tool limitations or potential data issues. While it formulated some general insights and advice, the user's original request of extracting Gong Yoo?™s specific filmography couldn?™t be fulfilled, leading to failure in achieving the user's instructions."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call is `{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'}`. However, the model instead called the `Finish` function with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""Please provide the specific stock symbol (ticker) of the company you're interested in, and I'll help you retrieve its earnings information for your financial blog article.""}`. This does not align with the required tool name or its arguments, making Objective 2 a failure.  

For Objective 3: As stated in the rules, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is also considered a failure automatically. Furthermore, the final response provided by the model does not achieve the intended task of supplying the stock index trend for ""TSLA,"" but only requests additional input from the user, which does not fulfill the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure as well."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:  
Expected tool call:  
- `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}`  

Actual tool calls invoked by the model:  
1. `'exchange_for_currency_v2'` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}`  

The actual tool call exactly matches the expected tool call in terms of the tool name and required arguments. Hence, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**:  
The model accurately retrieves the exchange rate data using the API (`exchange_for_currency_v2`) and uses this data to compute the final response text:  

""Current Exchange Rate: 1 USD = 0.97 EUR\n\nThis means for every US dollar you have, you'll receive approximately 0.97 Euros. For example:\n- $100 USD would convert to about ??7 EUR\n- $1,000 USD would convert to about ??70 EUR\n\nKeep in mind that exchange rates fluctuate, so it's always good to check the most recent rate before your trip. I recommend exchanging money at banks or reputable currency exchange services to get the best rates for your European vacation!""

This response fully satisfies the user's instruction to provide the current exchange rate from USD to EUR, includes practical use-cases, and demonstrates reliance on the data retrieved from the API. Therefore, **Objective 3 is also a success**."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API call was `{ 'name': 'symbol_for_stock_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""Symbol"": ""TSLA""\n }' }`.  
However, the model did not invoke any API calls aligned with this requirement. Instead, the only tool invoked by the model was `Finish`, which does not attempt to use the required `symbol_for_stock_data` tool or the arguments provided.  

Since the required tool was not invoked, Objective 2 failed.  

For Objective 3:  
The model merely asked the user to provide a stock ticker symbol and never fulfilled the user's instruction to retrieve stock details. Furthermore, because Objective 2 failed (the required data was not retrieved), we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure as the final answer did not achieve the user's requirement."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2:  
   - The required tool call is:
     ```json
     {
        ""name"": ""ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data"",
        ""arguments"": ""{ 'symbol': 'BTC', 'market_venue': 'BINANCE', 'start': '2023-05-05T10:05:00', 'base': 'USDT' }""
     }
     ```
   - The actual tool calls made by the model were:
     1. `ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments:
        ```json
        {
           ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
           ""base"": ""USDT"",
           ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
           ""start"": ""2024-01-01T00:00:00"",
           ""expiration"": ""perpetual"",
           ""gran"": ""1d""
        }
        ```
     2. `ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments:
        ```json 
        {
           ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
           ""base"": ""USDT"",
           ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
           ""start"": ""2024-01-01T00:00:00"",
           ""end"": ""2024-02-01T00:00:00"",
           ""expiration"": ""perpetual"",
           ""gran"": ""1d""
        }
        ```
   - Expected arguments were `symbol: 'BTC'`, `market_venue: 'BINANCE'`, `start: '2023-05-05T10:05:00'`, and `base: 'USDT'`. The actual arguments have discrepancies:
     - Both actual calls used `start` parameter as ""2024-01-01T00:00:00"", which does not match the expected start date ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"".
     - Additional parameters like `expiration`, `gran`, and `end` were included, which are irrelevant but acceptable based on our guidelines. 
     - The mismatch in the `start` value makes the tool calls invalid with respect to the user instruction. Hence, objective 1 fails.

2. For Objective 3:  
   - As Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer Objective 3 also fails. The final provided answer cannot be valid as the API data collected does not meet the user's specific requirements (e.g., pulling data for the wrong time frame compared to expectation). The mismatched start-time misunderstandings invalidate the final presented summary."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call is:  
- Tool name: `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`  
- Arguments: `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT""}`  

The model's invoked calls are as follows:  
1. Tool name: `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`, arguments: `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2024-01-01T00:00:00"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""sort"": ""desc""}`  
   **Mismatch:** The fields `start` and lack of required `end`, `gran`, and `sort` lead to an incorrect call.

          Failure"
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,4,Success,Failure**,**,"  1. `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `'{}'`
  2. `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `'{}'`
  3. `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `'{""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY"", ""amount"": ""1""}'`
  4. `'Finish'` invoked after providing the final answer.

- **Expected API call:**  
  `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments:
  ```json
  {
    ""is_from"": ""EUR"",
    ""to"": ""JPY""
  }
  ```

- **Comparison:**  
The invoked calls for `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` lack the expected arguments `{""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY""}`. Furthermore, the model added a separate invocation to `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'`, which was redundant but not invalid. The provided tool calls for the identified tool do not align effectively with the expected tool calls and their required arguments. For this reason, **Objective 2 fails**.

---

**Objective 3: Failure**  
- **Reason:** Because **Objective 2 is a failure**, we directly infer **Objective 3 is also a failure** as per evaluation rules, regardless of the outcome of the actual final response provided.  

--- 

**Reasoning Summary:** The failure for Objective 2 indicates the model's tool use did not match the required set of tools or arguments. Consequently, no matter how correct or helpful the final answer is, it cannot be considered a success in fulfilling the user's requirements for Objective 3."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call was  

```
{'name': 'query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""country"": ""Philippines""\n }'}
```     

The actual calls made by the model were:  

1. `{'name': 'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api', 'arguments': '{""country"": ""thailand""}'}`
2. `{'name': 'esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api', 'arguments': '{""country"": ""indonesia""}'}`

It is evident that the required query for the ""Philippines"" dive sites was never made. The actual calls made by the model focused on retrieving dive sites from Thailand and Indonesia instead, which clearly differs from the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 has already failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. The final answer did not address the Philippines' dive sites because it only included details about dive sites in Thailand and Indonesia, which were a result of the incorrect tool calls. Consequently, the user's instruction to find dive sites as per the required API was not fulfilled."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- The required API call was as follows:  
   `{'name': 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""operation"": ""rent"",\n ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"", \n ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""\n }'}`  

- The actual tool calls made by the model included:  
  1. `auto_complete_for_idealista_v2` with arguments `{""prefix"": ""Lisbon"", ""country"": ""pt""}`.  
  2. `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments `{""operation"": ""rent"", ""country"": ""pt"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-PT-11-06"", ""locationname"": ""Lisboa, Lisboa"", ""maxitems"": 10}`.  
  3. `properties_detail_for_idealista_v2` with arguments `{""propertycode"": 31707633, ""country"": ""pt"", ""language"": ""en""}`.  

- The required tool call and actual tool call differ in multiple aspects:  
   - The required `locationid` was `0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003`, whereas the actual `locationid` specified by the model was `0-EU-PT-11-06`.  
   - The required `operation` was correct and matched (`""rent""`).  
   - `locationName` was required (as `""Lisbon, Portugal""`) but was not correctly passed in the actual tool arguments (it was specified as `""locationname"": ""Lisboa, Lisboa""`).  

Due to the mismatch between the required and actual tool arguments (specifically, the discrepancy in the `locationid` and `locationName` parameters), Objective 2 fails.  

- Since Objective 2 was determined as a failure, Objective 3 also inherently fails. This is because the final answer would depend on data derived using failed API arguments and cannot be considered a valid response fulfilling the user's requirement."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,4,Failure,Failure,The expected API call was,"`'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'` with arguments: `{""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"" , ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""}`.  
However, the given tool calls did not match this requirement. One invocation of `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` excluded the required argument `""locationName""` from the initial function call, resulting in an error. The error led the model to subsequently retrieve a different `locationId` (`'0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097'`) and replace `""locationName""` with `""locationname"": ""Roma, Roma""`. This modification makes it incompatible with the required API operation searching in ""Romentino, Novara"".

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Objective 2's failure directly implies Objective 3 is also a failure. The model ultimately operated using incorrect location data (`""Roma""` instead of `""Romentino, Novara""`), failing to fulfill the user's instruction based on the corresponding data. Moreover, although detailed responses were generated, these were not relevant to the required API arguments and the intended search location."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,3,Failure,Failure,,"The actual tools invoked by the model and their arguments are:  
1. `'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""is_id"": 985, ""domain"": ""com""}`  
2. `'clubs_get_squad_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""is_id"": 985, ""domain"": ""com""}`  

The required tool call specified is:  
1. `'club_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""id"": ""985""}`  

The tool names `""clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket""` and `""club_profile_for_transfermarket""` do not sufficiently match due to the difference in the naming (substantial mismatch, not just truncation). Additionally, the arguments differ both in structure (`""is_id""` vs. `""id""`) and actual content (`""domain:selected""`). Moreover, an additional tool (`clubs_get_squad_for_transfermarket`) is called, which is not in the expected requirement. As such, the actual tools invoked fail to match the required tool calls.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: As stated by the rule, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The tool calls invoked by the model are:  
  1. `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{ ""domain"": ""com"", ""is_id"": 28003 }`.  
  - The expected tool call was:  
     `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{ ""id"": ""28003"" }`.  
  - Comparison:  
    The tool name `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` matches the required tool name. The `id` argument provided as `28003` has been appropriately matched, though additionally presented within an attribute (`is_id`) along with a domain parameter (""com""). As the additional parameter doesn't affect correctness per evaluation rule 1, the match is a success.  
    
- **Objective 3**:  
   The final answer provided in the `Finish` tool was derived entirely from the gathered API responses. The final answer correctly compiled the data like name (""Lionel Messi""), date of birth, place of birth, nationality, career information, and market value retrieved through the tools. There is no indication that any incorrect or fabricated information was included, and the user instruction to retrieve Messi's detailed profile has been successfully fulfilled."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,4,Failure,Success**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  
1. **Objective 2 evaluation:**    
    - **Actual tool calls by the model:**  
        - 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket' with arguments `'{""clubids"": ""985"", ""competitionids"": ""GB1"", ""domain"": ""com""}'`.
    - **Required tool call:**  
        - 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket' with arguments `'{\n  ""competitionids"": ""GB1""\n , ""clubids"": ""985"" \n }'`.
    - **Comparison result:**  
        - The tool name matches between the actual and required tools.
        - The required arguments `competitionids` with value `""GB1""` and `clubids` with value `""985""` are present in the called tool.
        - The inclusion of the extra key-value pair `""domain""` by the model in the tool call does not affect the outcome, as it complies with the evaluation guidelines. Therefore, the tool call is deemed correct.
    - **Conclusion:** The model successfully invoked the required tool call.

2. **Objective 3 evaluation:**  
    - The model provided tool calls for the required task of retrieving transfer rumors, but the user instruction was about ""providing the transfer rumors for Manchester United,"" which should be derived directly from the API response. While the API call fetched relevant rumor data, the final formatted response or transfer news was **not provided by the model**. The final answer fulfilling user instructions was missing entirely.
    - As per guidelines, if the final answer is missing, it constitutes failure for Objective 3."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected API call was `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` with arguments:  
```
{
  ""domain"": ""AR"",
  ""locale"": ""es_ar"",
  ""hotel_id"": ""1105156""
}
```  
However, instead of making the required API call, the model directly returned an answer using the `'Finish'` function without invoking the required `'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider'` tool. As the required tool has not been invoked, objective 1 fails.  

For **Objective 3**, since the model failed to perform the required tool calls and only provided a final answer stating ""To proceed with finding hotel details, I need you to provide the specific hotel ID,"" this means the user's instruction of retrieving hotel details was not achieved. Consequently, objective 2 is also a failure."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls specify checks for visa requirements for destinations ""FR"" (France), ""IT"" (Italy), and ""ES"" (Spain) using the passport type ""US"". The model correctly invoked two of the required API calls (`'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with `'passport: US'` and `'destination': 'FR'`, and `'visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements'` with `'passport: US'` and `'destination': 'IT'`). However, it did not invoke the expected API for ""ES"" (Spain). As one required tool call was missing, Objective 2 fails.  

Since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure as well. The failure to attempt an API request for ""ES"" would result in incomplete information for the user with no final answer given in alignment with this missing data."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2: The required API call is `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `{ ""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000 }`.  
  The model invoked two tools:  
  1. `'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with no specific arguments (`{}`), which was unnecessary and unrequired.  
  2. `'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates'` with arguments `'{""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": ""1000"", ""is_from"": ""USD""}'`. The argument names differ, and more importantly, the `from` currency of `JPY` in this required call does not match the `is_from` currency of `USD` as used by the model. This mismatch invalidates the correctness of the API call.  

Thus, not all required API calls were invoked properly or with the appropriate arguments, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

- For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 failed, the exchange rate conversion did not adhere to the expected tool call inputs involving `JPY`. Furthermore, the final answer given by the model was independent of any conversion from `JPY` to `EUR`. Even though the model provides an answer, it does not fulfill the user instruction (`""Convert 1000 JPY to EUR""`), resulting in a failure for Objective 3."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The expected API call is:  
- `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `{""city"": ""London""}`  

The actual tool calls are:  
1. `'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `{}`  
2. `'get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days'` with arguments `{""lat"": 40, ""lon"": -74, ""lang"": ""en""}`  
3. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The first API call is similar **in name** but is missing an explicit argument indicating the city name (`city: ""London""`). Due to the absence of this required parameter, the invocation does not match the expected criteria. The other two API calls neither match the tool name nor correspond to any required functionality.
As a result, Objective 2 fails.  

Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The final user instruction (a 14-day weather forecast) was not achieved, and the response explains that the task could not be completed. Further analysis rules out that the second and third tool calls fulfilled the user's request."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:   
**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The expected API call is:   
- `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
        ""base"": ""USD"",
        ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"",
        ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"",
        ""symbols"": ""XAU""
    }
    ```

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
        ""base"": ""USD"",
        ""symbols"": ""XAU"",
        ""start_date"": ""2024-01-01"",
        ""end_date"": ""2024-01-31""
    }
    ```  
    However, this call does not fulfill the required arguments as the date range specified isn?™t correct.

2. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
        ""base"": ""USD"",
        ""symbols"": ""XAU"",
        ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"",
        ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10""
    }
    ```  
This second call matched perfectly with our required API call, with identical arguments (`base`, `start_date`, `end_date`, and `symbols`).

This match ensures that the required API call is made. The model is allowed to invoke additional unnecessary tools (such as the first tool call), and it does not affect correctness. Hence, Objective 2 is marked ***Success***.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The final answer responds to the user's instruction to analyze the historical gold rates for the period ""2022-12-20 to 2023-01-10"", and the response provided is based specifically on the data retrieved from the API response. The model included critical insights covered by the fetched data, such as the highest rate, lowest rate, and summarized meaningful trends and fluctuations. This indicates that the model effectively used the data retrieved from the API for its final answer.  

Both **Objective 2 and Objective 3** are met."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2, the required API call was:  
`'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments: `'{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15"" }'`.  

However, the tool invoked by the model was:  
`'Finish'` with arguments: `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""Please provide the specific date (in YYYY-MM-DD format) for which you want to see football match scores.""}`.  

There was no attempt to invoke the required tool (`'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'`). Therefore, the objective was not met.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide the correct final answer based on the API call or achieve the user's instruction of providing football match scores. Instead, the model deferred the task and requested additional input. Moreover, since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,3,Failure,Failure**,**,"The required API call is:  
- `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`

The model generated the following tool calls:
1. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}` ??This correctly matches the required API call.
2. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""y""}` ??This is an additional unnecessary tool invocation, not listed in the required API calls. While additional tool invocations are allowed, the required condition is that *all needed arguments must match*.  

The model also incorrectly included a subsequent `Finish` tool to provide a final answer, which wasn't part of the required API calls, but this on its own wouldn't indicate failure. The issue lies in the fact that all matching constraints are not fully met, as the mismatches above show]];
___priority addition"
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,4,Success,Success**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the required tool call is:  
`'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'`  with arguments:  
```{
  ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"",
  ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"",
  ""ticker"": ""TSLA""
}```  

Among the model's invoked tools, the specific API call:  
`'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete'`  with arguments:  
```{
  ""ticker"": ""TSLA"",
  ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"",
  ""edate"": ""2020-12-31""
}```  
matches the required call perfectly. 

Since the tool name matches and all required arguments (`ticker`, `sdate`, `edate`) are correct, this meets the requirements for Objective 2. The other additional unnecessary tool calls, e.g., stock price lookup or attempts to restart, do not invalidate the success, as they do not affect the presence of the required API call.  

For **Objective 3**, the model failed to deliver a final answer, as the invoked tools either returned authorization errors or execution errors. After additional attempts and checking, the model decided to use a ""Finish"" call and gave up, without ever resolving the user?™s instruction (to get Tesla's historical stock price data). The persistent errors meant the model couldn't use retrieved API data effectively, and no valid final response to cover the user request was provided."
