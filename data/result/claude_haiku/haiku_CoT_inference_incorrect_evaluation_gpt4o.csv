1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the tools invoked by the model do not fully align with the required API calls.  
- Actual tools invoked:  
  1. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`: `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}`  
  2. `packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2`: (called twice) `{""carriercode"": ""fastway-au"", ""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999"", ""lang"": ""en""}` and `{""carriercode"": ""fastway-ie"", ""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999"", ""lang"": ""en""}`  
  3. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`: `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT9999999999""}`  

- Required API calls:
  1. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`: `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
  2. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`: `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

**Discrepancy:**  
The actual `trackingnumber` argument in the invoked tools does not match the required `trackingNumber` argument (`YT9999999999` vs. `YT2003521266065328`). Additionally, the unnecessary calls to `packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2` are unrelated to the required calls, further indicating a misalignment.  

As Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is inferred to fail. Moreover, the final answer is absent, indicating no output derived from the API calls."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2** - To evaluate the correctness of tool calls executed by the model: 
1. **Required API Calls:**  
   - 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'  
   - 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'

2. **Tools Invoked by the Model:**  
   - 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}'  
   - 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"": ""NY9999999990""}'

The tracking number 'YT2003521266065328' was required, while the model used 'NY9999999990' in both tool calls. Since this mismatch in arguments is not semantically equivalent (tracking numbers are sensitive and strict identifiers by nature), Objective 2 is a failure.

**Objective 3** - The evaluation of the final user's instruction and if the provided response relied on API behavior:  
Since Objective 2 failed, the tool responses were based on incorrect inputs. As a result, the model's final response (detailed text explaining failure in tracking with carrier detection results) did not correctly fulfill the user's instruction, because it attempted to address the wrong tracking number ('NY9999999990' rather than 'YT2003521266065328'). Moreover, as Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly fails as per evaluation rules.

Thus, both objectives failed due to incorrect tracking number arguments in the API calls."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are:  
1. `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
2. `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
2. `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

The tool names and parameters match the required API calls. While the casing of ""iOS"" in the tool names differs between ""iOS"" vs. ""ios,"" this doesn't affect correctness based on our guidance. Accordingly, Objective 2 is successful.  

For Objective 3:  
The user requested the details of the app with the ID `1053012308` and similar apps. The model retrieved the specific app's details using the `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` tool, which provided complete app information for the app titled ""Clash Royale,"" including its description and URL. Subsequently, the model used the `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` tool, which returned detailed data of a similar app titled ""Castle Crush: Clash Cards Game."" The model relied directly on the data retrieved from the API calls to provide its answer. Thus, the user's instruction was fulfilled, and Objective 3 is a success."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,3,1,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The model made the following tool call:  
   `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}`.  
- The required API call was:  
   `'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'` with arguments:  
   ```
   {
     ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"",
     ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""
   }
   ```
- The tool name matches and the arguments provided by the tool call align exactly with the required arguments. Additional or unnecessary tool calls did not affect correctness. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3:  
- The user's instruction was to retrieve and present the winning number sets for drawing dates between January 1, 2023, and January 10, 2023.  
- The tool response contained the winning number sets in the requested date range.  
- The model used this data appropriately and provided the final answer as:  

  ```
  Here are the Fantasy 5 winning number sets between January 1st and January 10th, 2023:
  
  1. January 10th (Evening): 3, 6, 17, 20, 30
  2. January 9th (Evening): 13, 21, 23, 24, 36
  3. January 8th (Evening): 6, 10, 12, 16, 28
  4. January 7th (Evening): 7, 8, 13, 24, 34
  5. January 6th (Evening): 3, 15, 16, 17, 34
  
  These are the evening drawing results for the specified date range. Good luck with your lottery play!
  ```  

- The final answer effectively communicates the data retrieved from the tool calls within the specified date range. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a success."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",5,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with arguments `{ ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae"" }`. However, the actual tool calls made by the model did not include the required parameter `""monitorAddressId""`. Instead, the model called `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with empty arguments `{}`, meaning that it failed to meet the requirements of the expected tool call.  

Since Objective 2 fails, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The final answer provided was not based on the expected API response for the required input and does not align with the user's instruction that included monitoring a specific address."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For Objective 2:  
   - **Expected tool calls:**  
     - 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
     - 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
   - **Actual tool calls:**  
     - 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`

   The model only invoked the 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' tool correctly. However, it failed to invoke the required 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' tool. As a result, the model did not attempt all the required API calls, leading to **Failure for Objective 2**.  

2. For Objective 3:  
   Since Objective 2 failed due to the incomplete tool invocation (missing the 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' tool invocation), it directly implies that Objective 3 also **fails** because it is dependent on all necessary API calls being performed to fully satisfy the user's requirements. The final answer was determined based on partial data fetched from 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox', hence, it was incomplete and not adequately fulfilling the user's instructions."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2: The tools invoked by the model are as follows:  
- `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""Unable to complete IP security check due to invalid or missing IP address. Please provide a valid IPv4 address to perform a security detection using Blackbox tools.""}`  

While the required tool calls are:  
- `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{\n  ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""\n }`  
- `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{\n  ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""\n }`  

The model failed to invoke either of the required tool calls. Instead, it invoked an unnecessary tool, `Finish`, which does not correspond to the required API calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Although the model provided a final answer, it did not retrieve any relevant data using the required tools and thus failed to properly achieve the user's instruction to check the security status of the IP address."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls versus the actual tool calls invoked by the model were as follows:  
**Required API Calls:**  
1. `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`
3. `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  

**Actual Tool Calls:**  
1. `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` with `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2"", ""limit"": ""100"", ""offset"": ""0""}`
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`
3. `artist_featuring_for_spotify_data` with `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`
4. `artist_albums_for_spotify_data` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"", ""limit"": ""100"", ""offset"": ""0""}`  

**Comparison and Analysis:**  
- For `artist_albums_for_spotify_data`, the final tool call was correct, as it matched the required API (`""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`). However, the additional parameters (`""limit""` and `""offset""`) are acceptable, as they do not alter correctness.  
- The model called `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` for the wrong artist ID (`""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""` instead of `""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`) earlier in the reasoning steps, which makes this invocation incorrect.  
- The model invoked `artist_featuring_for_spotify_data`, which is not part of the required API calls. Meanwhile, `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` (a required call) was completely missed.  

Because **one required tool (`artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data`) was never invoked**, and some invocations used an incorrect artist ID, Objective 2 failed.

For Objective 3:  
The model eventually retrieved valid data from the tool call for the correct artist ID `""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""`, with one successful invocation of `artist_albums_for_spotify_data`. However, it neither encapsulated the data into the final answer nor accomplished the user's instruction. Moreover, significant portions of the requested APIs failed or were not executed successfully.  
Finally, an appropriate final response summarizing these issues/error details for the given artist `""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""` was never returned to the user. As no accurate output based on API data was provided, Objective 3 also failed."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9"" }`  
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{ ""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9"" }`  

Here, the tool names match the required API calls, but the argument `""is_id""` differs (`""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""` expected vs. `""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""` actual). As the arguments mismatch, **Objective 2 fails**.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2 failed**, it directly implies **Objective 3 is also a failure**. Furthermore, the model ultimately did not provide a proper final answer to the user's intended query due to tool failures. The model gave up using the `""Finish""` function with `""give_up_and_restart""`, thus failing to deliver the user's requested songs and details."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Comparison**  
The required tool calls are as follows:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`  
2. `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'` with arguments `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  

The actual tool calls match the required ones, including tool names and arguments. Hence, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

**Objective 3 Analysis**  
The final answer provided is:  
*""MrBeast YouTube Channel Details:  
- Channel ID: UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA

- Banner Images: Multiple sizes available (with widths up to 1138 pixels)  

The channel has a distinctive profile picture and banner, which can be accessed via the provided URLs. The channel ID is unique and can be used for further API queries or channel-specific operations.""*

The final answer includes specific information (channel ID, profile picture details, banner details) retrieved from the API responses of the invoked tools. It aligns with the user's instruction to analyze the YouTube channel. Therefore, **Objective 3 is also a success.**"
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
   - The tool invoked by the model: `validate_email_for_validate_email` with arguments `{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}`.  
   - The required API call: `validate_email_for_validate_email` with arguments `{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}`.  
   - Both the tool name and arguments match exactly between the actual and required API calls.  
   - Additional tool `Finish` was also invoked, but as per the evaluation instructions, additional tools that are not required do not affect the evaluation.  
   - Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**:  
   - From the tool-generated response (`validate_email_for_validate_email`), the data confirmed the validity of the email ""test@gmail.com"" with detailed validation results.   
   - The final answer provided matches the tool's response and achieves the user instruction, explicitly stating that the email ""test@gmail.com"" is valid and describing the validation checks in detail.
   - Hence, the final answer was derived from the API response, and the user's instruction was fulfilled.
   - Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the tool invoked by the model is `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` with arguments `{""date"": ""19870630""}`, which matches the required API call (`'name': 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator', 'arguments': '{ ""date"": ""19870630"" }'`). The additional unnecessary tool `usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator` and `Finish` invoked by the model do not affect the correctness of the evaluation as the required tool call is included and accurate. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the final answer fulfills the user's request and is derived from the API data. The final answer provides age details based on the date of birth (June 30, 1987) and uses the time zone information ('US/Eastern') returned by the `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'` tool. The response clearly mentions the DOB, age, time zone, and other relevant details from the tool's output, satisfying the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
1. Required tool calls:  
   - `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments: `{ ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}`  
   - `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments: `{ ""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}`  
   - `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments: `{ ""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}`  

2. Actual tool calls made by the model:  
   - `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments: `{""type"": ""video"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""maxresults"": 5}`  
   - `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments: `{""type"": ""video"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""maxresults"": 5}`  
   - `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments: `{""is_id"": ""5xxjJJKQ4y8"", ""part"": ""snippet,statistics""}`  

The arguments used by the model are incorrect. Most importantly:
- The `relatedtovideoid` key in the `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` tool is `""5xxjJJKQ4y8""` instead of the required `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`.
- The `is_id` key in `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` is `""5xxjJJKQ4y8""` instead of the required `""7ghhRHRP6t4""`.  
- Lastly, the `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` tool was completely absent.  

Since the actual tool calls do not correspond to the required tool calls (arguments are mismatched and an expected tool is not called), **Objective 2 fails.**  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 has failed, we can directly infer that the fetched data could not support the user's instruction, and thus **Objective 3 also fails.** In this instance, the final answer?îwhile clearly apologetic and somewhat descriptive?îwas based entirely on failure to correctly perform the required API calls and is not successful in addressing the user's instructions or retrieving the expected data. There was no adequate final retrieval of appropriate ""recommendations, video details, or user comments""."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  - `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""50""}`  
  - `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  

  The required API calls were:  
  - `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  
  - `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`  

  Upon comparing, both required tool calls were successfully invoked. The one additional parameter `""maxresults"": ""50""` in the `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` tool does not affect the accuracy because all required arguments are correctly provided. Hence, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer fulfilling the user's instruction to provide playlist and video details. Although the model attempted several tool calls to retrieve data, it either encountered errors or identified mismatches (e.g., playlist ID issue, different content type). The response remained procedural and led to follow-up questions, implying the user's instruction was not achieved. Thus, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:  
The expected API calls were as follows:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `{ ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }`
2. `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments `{ ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }`

The tool calls made by the model were as follows:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `{ ""user_id"": ""987654321"", ""limit"": 20 }`  
(Note: The user ID here is completely different, and thus does not match the expected. Additionally, setting a ""limit"" is unnecessary and does not align with expected intentions.)  
2. No API call was made to `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'`.  

Since neither argument ""user_id"" was correct nor the second required tool call `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` was invoked, Objective 2 fails. 

For Objective 3:   
Since Objective 2 is already a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails. Furthermore, albeit the model communicated useful feedback to the user (such as specifying requirements for retrieving followers), it does not ultimately fulfill the explicit required instruction, namely to retrieve followers and likes for the specified user ID `96479162`. The API calls made were unsuccessful, and the final answer didn't depend on validly queried API data."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required tool call was `'user_details_for_twitter'` with `{ ""username"": ""omarmhaimdat"" }`. However, the model invoked tools `""search_for_twitter""` and `""Finish""` which are different from the required `user_details_for_twitter`. Thus, the required tool call has not been invoked, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 can be directly considered as a failure as well. The model's final conclusion does not fulfill the requirements since the needed user details from Twitter (`user_details_for_twitter`) were not fetched to provide an accurate answer fulfilling the user?ôs objective."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required the `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` tool with the argument `{""search"": ""google.com""}`, but the actual tool invoked by the model used the argument `{""search"": ""wikimania.org""}` with the `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` tool. Since ""google.com"" was not the domain being queried in the actual tool call, it does not match the expectation.  
Because the required API call was not accurately executed, Objective 2 fails, and as per the rule, this directly implies Objective 3 also fails."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025?

The date in the arguments differs significantly, as the model retrieved data for a distinct date (`""2023-01-15""` rather than `""2024-06-01""`). Consequently, Objective 2 fails. Additionally, as Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is also a failure because the model's final answer did not fulfill the required user's request or rely on the correct tool calls."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. The expected API call was for `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the argument `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`. The model, however, did not invoke this API. This means the model did not meet the requirements of invoking the specific API call to gather fear and greed index for the given date. Hence, the evaluation for Objective 2 fails.  
2. The model's final statement was: `""I apologize, but I cannot retrieve Fear and Greed index scores for non-existent dates (February 30th and 31st). These dates are not valid in the calendar. If you would like to know the Fear and Greed index for a specific, valid date, please provide a correct date, and I'll be happy to help you.""` Herein, the model concluded the task without retrieving any relevant Fear and Greed index data from the required API call. Since no API-related data was utilized and the requisite tool were never invoked, the user's instruction was not fulfilled. This leads to a failure in Objective 3."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the model failed to retrieve the required information to achieve the user's instruction using the specified API call. Although the final answer attempted to explain the issue with the invalid dates, it was not derived from API data and didn't fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve the Fear and Greed index for any date. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The actual tool call invoked by the model was: `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}`, whereas the required API call expected was `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`. The model failed to invoke the tool with the correct argument and used an invalid date format instead of the expected date. Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3: As Objective 2 is a failure, the evaluated system also fails for Objective 3 by default. Additionally, although the final answer gave a reasonable explanation about the invalid date used in the call, it deviated from achieving the user's actual instruction to retrieve the historical Fear and Greed index for the specified date. This shows that the response was crafted independently rather than using the expected tool output, further contributing to the failure in fulfilling the user's request."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The required API calls are:  
1. 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{ ""is_id"": ""80057281"" }'.  
2. 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{ ""ids"": ""80057281"" }'.  

The actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:  
1. 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{ ""is_id"": ""90068472"" }'.  
2. 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{ ""ids"": ""90068472"" }'.  

The model invoked the correct functions but provided incorrect values for the required arguments (""is_id"" and ""ids""). Instead of the expected value ""80057281,"" the model used ""90068472,"" which does not match the required input. This mismatch renders Objective 2 a **failure**.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 has failed, we directly infer that Objective 3 also fails. The final answer (""I apologize, but I was unable to retrieve trailers or detailed information for the title with ID 90068472..."") is based on the incorrect tool calls and does not meet the requirement of providing information or a trailer associated with the title ID ""80057281"". Therefore, the user's instruction could not be fulfilled, making Objective 3 a failure."
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472. Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The model invoked the following tools:  
- `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""90068472"", ""limit"": ""25"", ""offset"": ""0""}`  
- `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""90068472""}`  

The expected tool calls are:  
- `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}`  
- `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`  

The tool names match the expected tool calls, but the arguments do not. The argument `is_id` for `title_similars_for_netflix_data` is `90068472`, whereas it should be `80057281`. Similarly, the argument `ids` for `title_details_for_netflix_data` is `90068472`, but the required value is `80057281`. As such, the tool calls do not fulfill the requirements, leading to failure for Objective 2. 

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure. The model was unable to correctly retrieve and utilize the necessary data from the API to achieve the user's instruction. Additionally, the user's request to retrieve similar titles for the provided title ID was not fulfilled, and the model eventually gave up on the task. This confirms the failure for Objective 3."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, we compare the required API calls with the actual tool calls invoked by the model:  
- **Required tool calls:**  
  1. `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }`  
  2. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }`  
- **Actual tool call made by the model:**  
  1. `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{ ""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net"" }`

The model failed to invoke the second required tool `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro`, and the argument provided for the first tool does not match the required argument (`""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net""` is not `""website"": ""getecz.com""`). The divergence in both tool name and argument indicates that the required API calls were not executed correctly, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, it directly implies that the model?ôs final response (""Based on the domain analysis..."") cannot be accurate with respect to the required user instruction or data retrieval because the appropriate API call data has not been fetched. The model independently generated a response based on incorrect API data and unrelated content. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, below is the comparison of the required API calls with the actual tools invoked by the model.
   
**Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**  
1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with `{ ""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net"" }`  
2. `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with `{ ""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net"" }`  
3. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` (irrelevant)   
  
**Expected or Required API Calls:**  
1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }`  
2. `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with `{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }`  

Comparison reveals that while the tool names match, the argument `website` is incorrect. The required argument was `""website"": ""getecz.com""`, but the model used `""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""`. Consequently, this mismatch results in a **failure** for Objective 2.
   
For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 invalidates the tool calls (invalid arguments, resulting in irrelevant data being retrieved), the provided final answer (`""Your website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net is currently not accessible or properly configured...""`) is based on incorrect tool inputs/data. Therefore, the model?ôs response could not fulfill the user's instruction, making Objective 3 an additional **failure**."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is:  
  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator"",
    ""arguments"": '{\n  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",\n  ""variable"": ""x""\n }'
  }
  ```  
- The actual call made by the model is:  
  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator"",
    ""arguments"": '{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'
  }
  ```  
Both the tool name and required parameters match correctly. Minor formatting differences in argument representation do not affect the correctness. Additional calls made (such as `validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` and `Finish`) are not needed but do not affect success for Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is satisfied.

For Objective 3:  
The model successfully performed the following steps to address the user's request:  
1. Validated the mathematical expression using `validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`.  
2. Differentiated the expression `2*x^2 + 3*x + 1` using `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` and obtained the correct result `4*x + 3`.  
3. Explained the differentiation process and delivered the final answer through the `Finish` tool call with the correct final answer `""The derivative of 2*x^2 + 3*x + 1 is 4*x + 3.""`.

The final answer aligns with the API result and satisfies the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 is achieved."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

- **For Objective 2:**  
  1. **Expected Tool Calls:**  
     - `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments:  
       ```  
       {  
         ""username"": ""leomessi""  
       }  
       ```  
     - `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` with arguments:  
       ```  
       {  
         ""username"": ""leomessi""  
       }  
       ```  
  2. **Actual Tool Calls:**
     - Invoked `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` twice with arguments:  
       ```  
       {  
         ""username"": ""leomesssi""  
       }  
       ```  
       and  
       ```  
       {  
         ""username"": ""leomessi""  
       }  
       ```  
     - Did not invoke `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` as required.

  Analysis: While the model invoked `'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile'` with the expected username argument (`""username"": ""leomessi""`) in the second attempt, it failed to invoke the required `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'`. This mismatch results in a **failure** for Objective 2.  

- **For Objective 3:**  
  The user's instruction to gather the profile information and Instagram stories for the user `""leomessi""` was not fulfilled. The failure in executing all required API calls compromises the response. While the model provided a detailed final answer regarding Instagram profile details only, it failed to obtain the user's stories from the `'get_story_for_instagram_profile'` API call. Thus, this results in a **failure** for Objective 3."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, let?ôs compare the actual tool calls with the required API calls.  
- **Actual Tool Call by the model**: `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with arguments `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`  
- **Expected Tool Call**: `'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary'` with arguments `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`  

The tool name and arguments match perfectly (without any misspellings or errors). Thus, the criteria for Objective 2 are met, marking it a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided a final answer that synthesized the definition using proper data retrieved from the API response. Examples and characteristics of 'onomatopoeia' were derived directly from the data presented by Urban Dictionary. The model performed a valid synthesis of this information into a complete and accurate final answer formatted to the user's requirements:  
- Explanation of term  
- Pronunciation written as `/??n??m√¶t??pi??/`  
- Language use attributes  
- Onomatopoeic word examples  

As the user's instruction was clearly achieved using the results of the expected tool call, Objective 3 is also a success."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:   
- For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
  ```  
  {'name': 'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data', 'arguments': '{ ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR"" }'}  
  ```  
  Actual tool call made by the model:  
  ```  
  {'name': ""currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data"", 'arguments': '{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}'}  
  ```  
  The tool name `""currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data""` matches the expected tool, and the arguments are also identical. Hence, Objective 2 is a success (no discrepancies in arguments or tool name).  

- For **Objective 3**, the final answer given by the model fulfills the requirement. The model successfully communicates the currency conversion with details:
  - Amount: `1000 JPY`
  - Exchange rate: `1 JPY = 0.0062 EUR`
  - Converted amount: `6.20 EUR`  
  These outputs align with the input API response (exchange rate retrieved is `0.0062`), and the required transformation of data (from_tool_call ??calculated amount ??final answer) has been performed effectively. No errors or additional irrelevant details were introduced in the process."
30,"I need a list of trending pages on 9GAG along with their posts. Also, fetch the comments for a specific post and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the expected tool call was `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with the argument `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`. However, the model invoked `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with the argument `{""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt""}` instead. The crucial argument `username` did not match the expected value, leading to failure for Objective 2. Consequently, as per the evaluation rules, Objective 3 is also a failure since Objective 2 did not succeed. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer, which further confirms the failure for Objective 3."

  The required tool call is:  
  ```  
  'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with arguments '{ ""username"": ""kleido007"" }'

  The tool name is correct, but the argument `""username""` is not the same. Specifically, the required username is `""kleido007""`, but the model invoked the call with `""hugo1232fesfgerwt""`. This mismatch leads to a failure for Objective 2.  

- Objective 3 Evaluation:  
  Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The final answer could not successfully respond to the user's intent because the necessary tool call did not include the correct argument to meet the user's requirements."

The tool names were correct, but both argument values for `url` and `music_id` in the actual tool calls did not match the expected argument values. Since the argument values are different, Objective 2 is a failure.  

According to the rule, if Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model's final response indicates it was unable to retrieve valid data due to the incorrect music ID, thereby not fulfilling the user's request."

2. `get_user_info_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""user_id"": 64556346745}`  

The required API call was:  
- `get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50"", ""time"": ""0""}`  

The model failed to execute the required tool call `get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video`. It used different tool functions (related to followers and user info) instead of retrieving the following list. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure, as no relevant tool data was retrieved or used to address user needs. Additionally, the model's final response admitted inability to retrieve necessary data and did not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve the TikTok user's following list."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API calls versus the actual tool calls are as follows:  

**Expected API calls**:  
1. `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{ ""channel"": ""xqc"" }`  
2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{ ""channel"": ""xqc"" }`  
3. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{ ""channel"": ""xqc"" }`  

**Actual tool calls invoked by the model**:  
1. `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{ ""channel"": ""dfasagergs"" }`  
2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{ ""channel"": ""dfasagergs"" }`  
3. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{ ""channel"": ""dfasagergs"" }`  

The discrepancy lies in the argument `""channel""` where the required name is `""xqc""` but the actual calls used `""dfasagergs""`. This difference makes Objective 2 a **failure**, and per the evaluation rules, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails by default.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 failed, we do not need further analysis in this case. Furthermore, the model did not fulfill the user's instructions of retrieving information about the specified Twitch channel successfully, as no valid data was returned, and the final result was an indication of task failure (""give up and restart"") rather than delivering the required information. Hence, **Objective 3 is also a failure**."

     2. `'get_user_id_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{""channel"": ""shadoune66666""}'`.  
     
     The model invoked the correct tool name (`get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api`), but the argument `""channel""` has the value `""shadoune66666""` instead of `""shadoune666""`. The two values are not semantically equivalent, as the required username is `""shadoune666""` but the model used `""shadoune66666""`. Additionally, the model invoked an unnecessary API call (`get_user_id_for_twitch_api`) even though this is permissible per the rules, but the mismatch on the required tool call argument leads to failure for Objective 2.  

2. **Objective 3:**  
   - Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically marked as a failure. The model's final answer was based on using incorrect user information (`shadoune66666` instead of `shadoune666`), which means the user's instruction to retrieve information for the required user was not achieved. Furthermore, the model's failure in Objective 2 makes its subsequent actions invalid for Objective 3."

The model invoked this required tool call successfully, and while additional tools were invoked that were not listed in the required API calls, they do not affect this evaluation.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
**Reason:** Although the required barcode lookup was successfully executed, the final answer that fulfills the user's request (e.g., providing product details for the barcode `194574942221`) was not provided explicitly in the output. The model attempted to process subsequent details using additional tools (e.g., `products_detail_for_kohls` and `reviews_list_for_kohls`) even after a correct response to the main barcode search was achieved, but it does not narratively consolidate this information as a complete final answer to the user's request. Neither was there conclusive integration of valid and retrieved data into any final response.

3. `'reviews_list_for_kohls'` with arguments `{""productid"": ""5372023""}`  
4. `'categories_list_for_kohls'` with arguments `{}`  

The API `reviews_list_for_kohls` was indeed invoked; however, the `productid` argument was `5372023`, which does not match the expected product ID `4201989`. Since the required argument does not match the expected value, Objective 2 fails.  

---

### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason:**  
As per the rules, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer given by the model does not satisfy the user request because it was based on erroneous input (`productid` = `5372023`), and there were no reviews retrieved for that product. The user's request related to reviews for a product was not achieved."

2. `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. A call to `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135"", ""sort_order"": ""RELEVANCE""}` ??This matches conceptually with the required call (additional `sort_order` is acceptable).  
2. A call to `products_search_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""keyword"": ""W003247135""}` ??This does **not** match the required `products_detail_for_wayfair` call (name and parameter structure differ).  

The `products_detail_for_wayfair` API call was never invoked. Additional tools like `products_search_for_wayfair` were used, but this does not replace the requirement for `products_detail_for_wayfair`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **failure** as at least one required tool call was missing.

---

For Objective 3:  
As Objective 2 failed, it is automatically inferred that Objective 3 fails as well. The model could not fulfill the user's instruction to gather complete information about the product with the specified SKU since critical APIs (specifically, `products_detail_for_wayfair`) were not invoked to retrieve detailed product information. Additionally, the model's final response merely explains the limitations and errors encountered, rather than fulfilling the requirement based on retrieved data."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls were as follows:

2. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with `{""sku"": ""X005789621"", ""sort_order"": ""RELEVANCE""}` (First attempt for an irrelevant SKU)  
2. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with `{""sku"": ""W003247135"", ""sort_order"": ""RELEVANCE""}` (Retrieving reviews for the correct SKU but still missing the required structure).  
3. `'products_search_for_wayfair'` with `{""keyword"": ""W003247135""}` (Irrelevant as it was not a required API call).  
4. `'reviews_list_for_wayfair'` with `{""sku"": ""W003247135"", ""sort_order"": ""RELEVANCE"", ""page"": 1}` (Extra parameter included for pagination which was not specified in the required structure).

40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,5,1,Failure,Success,Failure**,"**Reason:**  

For Objective 2:
The model actually invoked the following relevant tool calls:
1. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments: `'{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`
2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments: `'{""productid"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`

The required API calls were:
1. `'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments: `'{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`
2. `'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'` with arguments: `'{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'`

Analysis:
- The tool names are an exact match with the required API calls. 
- While the argument key in the actual and required tool calls has very slight syntactic differences (`productid` vs. `productId`), they both have identical meaning, referring to the same `productId` (B00K3OM3PS). This discrepancy does not impact correctness, and such minor discrepancies are acceptable.  

Thus, all the required API calls are fulfilled according to the evaluation criteria, which makes Objective 2 a **Success**.  

For Objective 3:
The model fulfilled Objective 2 by invoking the required tools, but the final response (final answer to the user's query) was **not provided**. Instead, the model clarified that the given product was not a laptop but rather a Harry Potter Blu-ray set and attempted generative explanations without directly providing an output based on finalized tool responses like reviews and offers per the user's original instruction. Since no concrete final answer matching the initial user query (""information about the laptop"") was given, Objective 3 is considered **Failure**."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  

1. **Objective 2 Analysis:**  
   - **Actual tool calls invoked by the model:**  
     - `get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""searchquery"": ""Mac""}`  
     - `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  
     - `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  
     - `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  

   - **Expected API Calls:**  
     - `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
     - `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  
     - `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`  

   **Comparison:**  
   - The model's invoked APIs have mismatched arguments. Specifically, the `productid` argument used in the actual tool calls is `3OM3PS`, whereas the required argument is `B00K3OM3PS`. This discrepancy renders the tool calls unsuccessful concerning the expected API calls. Additionally, an unnecessary API (`get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`) not required by the task was invoked.  
   - Due to the error in the argument values (`3OM3PS` instead of `B00K3OM3PS`), **Objective 2 fails**.

2. **Objective 3 Analysis:**  
   - Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails as the required API data necessary to provide a correct final answer was not retrieved correctly by the tool calls.  
   - Furthermore, there was no final answer provided directly to fulfill the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 fails.

**Summary:** Both objectives fail due to incorrect API arguments in the actual tool calls and the absence of a correct final answer in the model's response."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,4,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**:
- The required tool call: `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`.  
- Actual tool calls by the model:  
    1. Initially, the model invoked `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""}`, but it was incorrect and did not match the required call.
    2. Attempting later, it retrieved the race list using `'race_list_for_f1_race_schedule'` and identified a possible match for the required ID `'6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7'`. After this, it correctly invoked `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`.
    
    As the required API call was indeed invoked by the model at the last step with the expected tool name and arguments, **Objective 2 is successful**, per the evaluation guidelines.

---

For **Objective 3**:  
The model gave a final answer that attempted to address the user's question, deriving the matching race ID through the API calls used. However, the instruction explicitly required retrieving and providing the **race details** for the specific race ID `'6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7'`. While API timeouts initially occurred and the model successfully fetched the matching ID and used it again in the final tool call, **there is no evidence that the final response was fulfilled because the content of the retrieved race details was not presented in the user's response**.  

This indicates that the model did not complete the user's objective of providing the race details after invoking the required tool calls. Hence, **Objective 3 has failed**."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 

For Objective 2:  
The required tool call is `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments  
```  
{  
  ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""  
}  
```  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""}`  
2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The tool name `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` is correct and matches the required tool. However, the required argument is `""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`, but the actual argument used by the model was `""is_id"": ""d27e0de553b9d7""`. This does not match the full ID required, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
The model's final answer highlighted persistent API timeouts and suggested alternative help, eventually concluding by invoking the `'Finish'` function. However, the user's instruction to find race details based on the specific race ID was never fulfilled because the correct API call was not made (as decided in Objective 2), causing API failure. Because of this, the final answer did not resolve or achieve the instructions provided by the user. As such, Objective 3 also fails."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required tool call was `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments `{ ""Symbol"": ""TQQQ"" }`.  
- The actual tool call made by the enhanced model was `'symbol_for_stock_data'` with arguments `{ ""symbol"": ""TQQQ"" }`.  

Here, the parameter name ""Symbol"" in the expected call does not match the parameter name ""symbol"" in the actual call exactly. Although the semantic intent seems to match, such differences in spelling/casing of parameter names (case mismatch) result in a failure by the provided evaluation guidelines.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed since the instructions and retrieved data did not align and fulfill the requirements completely. Furthermore, while the system retrieved some more specific information about the symbol `TQQQ`, the model failed to retrieve critical requested data, including P/E ratio, EPS, and others, rendering the response insufficient as per the query's requirements. As stated in the model's final return, it gave up and recommended additional actions for the user. Thus, it cannot fulfill the instruction."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"- 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats' with arguments: '{ ""name"": ""riven"" }'.  

The tool call invoked by the model that matches this API call is:
- 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats' with arguments: '{""name"": ""riven""}'.

The tool name and arguments match the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success. There are also additional tool calls, but they do not affect the correctness of the expected tool calls.  

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The final answer provides complete and correct base stats for ""Riven."" These stats match the values retrieved from the tool's response, demonstrating that the final response is derived from the invoked API calls. Hence, the model successfully achieved what the user instructed based on the retrieved data."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- For Objective 2:  
    Tools invoked by the model:  
    - `'name': 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', 'arguments': '{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'`  

    Required API calls:  
    - `'name': 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""\n }'`  

    The tool name and required arguments are accurately matched (including semantically negligible differences like formatting), so all required API calls are invoked correctly. Also, no changes in the required data for `B07ZPKBL9V` ASIN are observed. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.
  
- For Objective 3:  
    The model provided a detailed final answer to the user's request based on the API call response?îpresenting accurate data such as the model's name, storage, color, price, rating, stock status, and relevant considerations for a renewed device (climate pledge friendly). This aligns with the retrieved API data and satisfies the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"The tool calls invoked by the model and the required API calls are as follows:  
**Invoked Tool Call by Model:**  
`'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with arguments `'{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"": ""fr""}'`  

**Expected API Call:**  
`'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` with arguments `'{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""toLang"": ""fr""}'`

The tool name `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'` matches exactly. The argument keys differ slightly (""toLang"" vs ""tolang""), but these can reasonably be interpreted as the same parameter given semantic equivalence. Thus, the tool call meets the expected requirements.  

**Objective 3: Success**  
**Reason:**  
The model provided the following final answer:
```
""Here?ôs the translation you requested:

Original (English): Hello, how are you?
Translated (French): Bonjour comment allez-vous?

The translation was automatically detected from English and converted to French. Enjoy your language exploration!""
```
This aligns perfectly with the response obtained from the invoked tool:
```
{""response"": ""{'status': 200, 'langDetect': 'en', 'translatedText': 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'}""}
```
The final answer reflects the data acquired through the API call and directly fulfills the user's initial request to translate the text from English to French."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- Tool invoked (actual tool call by the model):  
  ```
  'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days' with arguments '{
  ""country_code"": ""US"",
  ""date"": ""2022-12-31""
  }'
  ```
  
- Required API call:  
  ```
  'get_info_day_for_working_days' with arguments '{
  ""country_code"": ""US"",
  ""date"": ""2022-12-31""
  }'
  ```
  
The tool name ('get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days') aligns semantically with the required tool ('get_info_day_for_working_days'), and the arguments match perfectly (""country_code"" is ""US"" and ""date"" is ""2022-12-31""). Additional arguments or fields aren't present to cause mismatches. Therefore, the required tools have effectively been invoked, achieving a success for Objective 2.

For Objective 3:  
- Final answer provided by the model:  
  ```
  ""December 31st, 2022 (2022-12-31) is NOT a working day in the US. It is a weekend day (Saturday), with 0 working hours. If you're planning travel or business activities, please note that this is outside of standard working hours.""
  ```
  
- Tool response invoked:  
  ```
  '{""working_day"": 0, ""work_hours"": 0, ""wages"": 0, ""morning_start"": """", ""morning_end"": """", ""afternoon_start"": """", ""afternoon_end"": """", ""public_holiday"": ""0"", ""public_holiday_description"": """", ""weekend_day"": 1, ""custom_date"": 0, ""custom_date_description"": """", ""custom_date_color"": """", ""type"": 1}'
  ```
  
The model effectively used the data retrieved via the API call to compose an accurate final answer. The API's response provided all necessary details (e.g., it is a weekend day, with 0 working hours, not a public holiday), and the final answer is fully grounded in this retrieved information, accurately fulfilling the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- The required API call was:  
  `'analyse_for_working_days' with arguments '{ ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"" }'`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model was:  
  `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days' with arguments '{ ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""configuration"": ""Federal holidays"" }'`.  
- Although the tool name had a slightly different structure (`'analyse_for_working_days'` vs. `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'`), due to guidance regarding naming deviations, this variation can be judged as semantically equivalent. Furthermore, the additional argument `""configuration"": ""Federal holidays""` is not required but does not alter the correctness, because the required arguments match both in name and value. Therefore, Objective 2 is successful.  

For Objective 3, the model's final response derived from the API call is as follows:  
- ""In 2013, the US had:  
  - 365 total days  
  - 251 working days  
  - 104 weekend days  
  - 10 federal holidays  

  The working days are distributed across the week, with most weekdays having around 50-52 working days. Typical federal holidays are observed, which might affect your travel or business plans. This information should help you plan your trip effectively.""  

The final response includes details directly derived from the tool response (`251 working days`, `104 weekend days`, `10 federal holidays`, etc.), correctly fulfilling the user query regarding the working days analysis within the specified time frame and country. Thus, Objective 3 is completed successfully."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:
- The required API call is:  
  `add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments:  
  ```python
  {
    ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
    ""country_code"": ""US"",
    ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
    ""increment_time"": 2004
  }
  ```
- The actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:  
  1. `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments:  
     ```python
     {
       ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
       ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
       ""country_code"": ""US"",
       ""increment_time"": ""2004""
     }
     ```
  2. `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments:  
     ```python
     {
       ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
       ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
       ""country_code"": ""US"",
       ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""
     }
     ```  

- The primary issue lies in the `increment_time` parameter. The required API call uses an integer (`2004`), but in the first model invocation, `increment_time` is a string (`""2004""`) and is in an invalid format, causing the tool's error response. Then the corrected attempt uses `""2004:00""`, which is still not in the required numerical format, although it succeeds in simulating an API response. Neither invocation complies with the required argument's expected type. This mismatch leads to a failure for Objective 2.

---

For Objective 3:
- Because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically marked as a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided relies on data retrieved using incorrectly formatted arguments in the API calls. Therefore, even independently, the final answer cannot be considered reliable or valid."
