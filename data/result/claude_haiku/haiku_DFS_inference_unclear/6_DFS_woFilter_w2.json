You mentioned being a university fresh graduate looking for opportunities, but you first said New York and then asked about jobs in London. I'll help you find job opportunities, but I'll need to clarify a few details.\n\nQuestion: Would you like me to search for entry-level or junior positions in London? And can you specify what kind of professional field or job title you're interested in (e.g., software development, marketing, finance, etc.)?\n\nThe job search tools I have access to require specific job titles and locations to provide meaningful results. By understanding your specific professional interests and preferred location, I can help you find the most relevant job opportunities for a recent graduate.",
