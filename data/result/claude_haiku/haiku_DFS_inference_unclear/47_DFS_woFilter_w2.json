I notice that the previous actions did not carefully derive the derivative step-by-step using the power rule of differentiation.\n\nLet me correct the differentiation:\n- For 3*x^5: The derivative is 3 * 5 * x^(5-1) = 15*x^4\n- For 2*x^4: The derivative is 2 * 4 * x^(4-1) = 8*x^3\n- For 1: The derivative is 0",
