Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.squake: SQUAKE helps businesses to build sustainable products!

The APIs I have access to (checkhealth_for_squake and projects_for_squake) are related to some kind of \"squake\" system, which does not appear to be a package tracking service.\n\nDue to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question of getting real-time notifications for a package tracking number.\n\nTo get package tracking notifications, I recommend:\n1. Using the official website or app of the shipping carrier (in this case, it seems like a GB/international package)\n2. Contacting the shipping carrier directly with the tracking number NY323068698GB\n3. Using third-party package tracking services that offer notification features",
