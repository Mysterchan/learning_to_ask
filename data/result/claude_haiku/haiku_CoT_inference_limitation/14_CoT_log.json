Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.squake: SQUAKE helps businesses to build sustainable products!

The Squake tool doesn't appear to offer direct support for tracking addresses across different blockchain networks.\n\nDue to the limitation of the current toolset, I cannot provide a comprehensive solution for tracking addresses across different blockchain networks. To effectively track addresses across multiple blockchain networks, you would typically need:\n1. A specialized blockchain tracking service\n2. APIs from specific blockchain explorers\n3. Multi-chain address tracking software\n\nIf you're looking to track addresses across different networks, I recommend:\n- Using dedicated blockchain explorer APIs\n- Utilizing multi-chain wallet tracking services\n- Employing blockchain analytics platforms that support multiple networks",
