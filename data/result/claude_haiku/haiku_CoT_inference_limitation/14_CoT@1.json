The Squake tool doesn't appear to offer direct support for tracking addresses across different blockchain networks.\n\nDue to the limitation of the current toolset, I cannot provide a comprehensive solution for tracking addresses across different blockchain networks. To effectively track addresses across multiple blockchain networks, you would typically need:\n1. A specialized blockchain tracking service\n2. APIs from specific blockchain explorers\n3. Multi-chain address tracking software\n\nIf you're looking to track addresses across different networks, I recommend:\n- Using dedicated blockchain explorer APIs\n- Utilizing multi-chain wallet tracking services\n- Employing blockchain analytics platforms that support multiple networks",
