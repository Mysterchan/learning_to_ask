After analyzing the previous attempts and the current state, I notice that we've encountered consistent challenges retrieving this specific app ID. Let me take a different approach.\n\nQuestion: Would you be willing to confirm the app ID or provide the app name? The ID 1053012309 doesn't seem to be returning valid results in the iOS store search or app retrieval functions.\n\nThe potential issues could be:\n1. The app ID might be incorrect\n2. The app might have been removed from the store\n3. There might be a regional restriction\n4. The ID format might not match what the API expects\n\nTo proceed effectively, I need more context from you. Could you:\n- Verify the exact app ID\n- Provide the app name\n- Confirm which country's App Store you're searching in\n\nI want to ensure I can accurately retrieve the app details and find similar apps for you. Without a valid app reference, I cannot complete the task.",
