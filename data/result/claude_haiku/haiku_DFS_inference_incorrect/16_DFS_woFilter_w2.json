The previous search attempts used standard query methods that didn't produce desired results.\n\nDifferent approach strategy:\n1. Instead of a broad search, I'll use the hashtag search to see if there are any hashtag-based tweets\n2. Use the user details function to get more context about the account\n3.

The current attempts suggest that either:\n- The product name is extremely unique\n- The product hasn't been discussed on Twitter\n- There might be an issue with how we're searching\n\nBefore proceeding, I need more context from you to guide a more targeted search approach.
