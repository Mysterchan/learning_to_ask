There's an available address quota of 2, with 0 used\n4. The specific BSC mainnet address you mentioned ('0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F') hasn't been explicitly used in previous queries\n\nNew Approach:\nI notice the `get_address_transaction_webhook_for_address_monitor` function requires a transaction ID. Since we don't have a transaction ID, and previous transaction queries were empty, I'll take a different action.\n\nKey Strategy: Instead of passively retrieving data, I'll ask a clarifying question to understand the exact configuration needed.\n\nQuestion: For the Address Monitor tool:\n1. Has the specific BSC mainnet address ('0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F') been pre-configured in the monitoring system?\n2. Are there any specific setup steps required before we can retrieve addresses and transactions?\n3. Do we need to explicitly add or register this address in the Address Monitor tool before we can fetch its transactions?\n\nThe previous attempts suggest the tool might require some initialization or configuration that we haven't completed. I want to ensure we understand the precise steps to activate monitoring for this specific blockchain address.\n\nWould you be willing to provide more details about the initial setup process for this Address Monitor tool, particularly for the BSC mainnet address you've mentioned?",
