The title ID might be malformed or incorrect\n2. We need to verify the existence of the title first\n3.

If you can provide the movie's name, I can perform a search to find its correct title ID and then retrieve similar titles.\n\nTo elaborate:\n- The title ID you provided doesn't seem to correspond to an actual Netflix title\n- The API calls (title_details and title_similars) both returned empty results\n- Without a valid title ID, I cannot retrieve similar titles\n\nThe most constructive next step is to ask you to:\n1. Verify the title ID\n2. Provide the actual movie name\n3. Confirm if you want me to search for similar titles based on the movie name",
