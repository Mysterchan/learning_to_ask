Could you please double-check and provide a correct IP address in the format xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, where each xxx is a number between 0 and 255?\n\nI cannot proceed with the analysis until I have a valid IP address to check. Once you provide a correct IP address, I'll be happy to help you investigate its potential security implications using the blackbox IP detection tools.",
