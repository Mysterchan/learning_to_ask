Previous attempts have used various artist-related functions (artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data, get_artists_for_spotify_data)\n2. The most recent attempt returned {'artists': [None]}, indicating a potential issue with the artist ID\n3. The previous actions have primarily focused on direct artist data retrieval\n\nGiven these observations, I'll take a different approach:\n\nQuestion: Can you confirm that the artist ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9' is a valid and current Spotify artist ID? \n\nI'm encountering persistent issues retrieving data for this specific artist ID. The consistent None or error responses suggest one of these possibilities:\n- The artist ID might be incorrect or outdated\n- There might be temporary issues with the Spotify data retrieval system\n- The artist might have been removed from Spotify's database\n\nBefore proceeding further, I recommend:\n1. Double-checking the artist ID's accuracy\n2. Verifying if the artist still exists on Spotify\n3. Potentially providing an alternative artist ID if available\n\nTo move forward effectively, I need your confirmation or additional guidance on how to proceed with retrieving the discovered songs.",

The current server appears to be experiencing technical difficulties that prevent me from retrieving the discovery information.\n\nThe steps I was planning to take were:\n1. Verify the artist's existence\n2. Find songs they've been discovered on or appeared on\n3. Retrieve details about those songs including names, descriptions, and cover art\n\nHowever, the current server error is blocking my progress. A fresh attempt or a different artist ID might help resolve this issue.",
