Previous attempts to use this specific product ID have failed across different API methods.\n\nGiven these insights, I'll take a different approach:\n\nQuestion: Could you please confirm the exact product ID you want me to investigate? The ID \"3OM3PS\" seems incomplete or incorrect. For Amazon product lookups, product IDs are typically longer (around 10-12 characters) and often start with 'B0' or similar.\n\nIf you're looking for a MacBook, from the search results, I can share some initial information:\n- An Apple MacBook Air 13.3-Inch Laptop (Renewed) was found\n- Price: $221.00\n- Rating: 4.2 stars\n- Total Reviews: 1,068\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.
