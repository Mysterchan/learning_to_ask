Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.twitter_v2_v2: Twitter public and private data API for search, Tweets, users, followers, images, media and more.\n"

Once I have that, I can help you retrieve his profile information using the Twitter tools available.\n\nI'll demonstrate how I would proceed:\n1. I would first use the \"user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2\" function to get his user ID and basic profile details\n2. Then potentially use other functions like \"user_tweets_for_twitter_v2_v2\" or \"user_media_for_twitter_v2_v2\" to get more information\n\nBut first, I need you to confirm: What is James's exact Twitter username/handle?",
