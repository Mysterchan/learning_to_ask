1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"The expected API call is [{'name': 'search_for_netflix_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""\n }'}].  
The actual tool calls invoked by the model include the following:  
1. `{'name': 'search_for_netflix_v2', 'arguments': '{""query"": ""The Matrix"", ""limit_titles"": 1}'}`  
2. `{'name': 'search_for_netflix_v2', 'arguments': '{""query"": ""The Matrix 1999"", ""limit_titles"": 1}'}`  
3. `{'name': 'title_details_for_netflix_v2', 'arguments': '{""ids"": ""81186049""}'}`  
4. `{'name': 'search_for_netflix_v2', 'arguments': '{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions"", ""limit_titles"": 1}'}`  

Although the model did issue a tool call with `{'name': 'search_for_netflix_v2', 'arguments': '{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions"", ""limit_titles"": 1}'}`, it added an unnecessary parameter `""limit_titles"": 1`. Since precision of required arguments is crucial, this inconsistency renders the evaluation a **failure** for Objective 2 due to deviation in argument structure.

---  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, according to the evaluation guidelines in such cases, Objective 3 is automatically a failure.
Additionally:  
The model failed to comprehensively answer the user's instruction using relevant data retrieved from the tool outputs. Its final response merely referenced pre-existing knowledge of the directors (""Wachowski siblings""), and this was not verified or supported by the actual retrieved API data. No confirmation about ""The Matrix Revolutions"" director was made using the required tool call output, nor is there any mention of conclusive data useful to the user. This further affirms Objective 3 as a failure."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
  - `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }`.

The actual API calls the model invoked are:  
  1. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""Star Wars"", ""limit_titles"": 5 }`.
  2. `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with arguments `{ ""query"": ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", ""limit_titles"": 5 }`.

The API calls made by the model do not include a search for `""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""` as required. Instead, it searches for `""Star Wars""` and `""Star Wars: A New Hope""`. As the required argument `""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""` is missing entirely, **the model does not complete the required criteria, resulting in a failure for Objective 2**.

---

- **Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure as per the outlined rule. Additionally, the model extracts no information from the required API call to address the user's instruction. Instead, the final answer provided relies on general knowledge unrelated to the Netflix API as required, further emphasizing the Objective 3 failure."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API call is `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`.  
- The actual tool call made by the model is `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`.  
- The tool name matches, and all the required arguments are correctly included. Hence, the API call matches the required call, satisfying Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer provided by the model is `""Here are the Fantasy 5 winning number sets for December 2023:\n\nDecember 31 (MIDDAY): 10 17 22 23 25\nDecember 31 (EVENING): 8 10 24 31 36\nDecember 30 (MIDDAY): 6 11 13 18 36\nDecember 30 (EVENING): 6 22 27 29 36\nDecember 29 (MIDDAY): 3 7 18 27 35\n\nNote: These are the complete winning number sets for the specified period, showing both midday and evening drawings. Each set consists of 5 numbers drawn on the respective dates.""`.  
- This answer directly uses data retrieved from the invoked API call `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`, essentially reformatting the output for user understanding. The final answer achieves the user's instruction, satisfying Objective 3."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,4,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"**Reason:**  

1. **Objective 2:**  
   - **Tool Calls by the Model:**  
     1) The model invoked `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `'{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}'`.  
     2) Later, the model invoked the same tool twice again, but with parameters like `'{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"", ""limit"": 20}'`, and subsequently `'{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"", ""limit"": 10}'`.  
   - **Expected API Call:**  
     One expected API call: `'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with arguments `{ ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"" }`.  
   - **Assessment:**  
     - The required API call (`'search_countries_timezone_for_geography'` with the correct `""timezone""` parameter) was successfully invoked by the model.
     - Additional arguments appearing in other tool calls (`limit`) are not part of the required parameters and do not impede the evaluation for this specific tool call's success.  
     - The expectation for tools with `""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""` has been fulfilled, so Objective 2 is a success.  

2. **Objective 3:**  
   - The fetched response indicates only one match (Antarctica) across the tool calls. Despite this, the model's final answer includes a broad list of other countries (Such as Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, etc.), none of which are fetched from tool responses.
   - Instead of giving an answer only based on retrieved API data, the model adds several unsupported countries using presumed geographical knowledge.
   - The provided final list merges invalid additional information (unsupported by the tool data) and hence does not achieve Objective 3.   

**Conclusion:**  
- While the tool calls encompass all the expected ones (making **Objective 2 a Success**), the final response fails to adhere solely to API-fetched data, rendering **Objective 3 a Failure**."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the evaluation is as follows:  
- **Tool invoked by the model:**  
  `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`  

- **Required API call:**  
  `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`    

The tool invoked by the model matches the required tool name and arguments. Hence, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**, the evaluation is as follows:  
The model provides a final answer through the `'Finish'` tool call. The answer states:  

> ""On December 18, 2022 (the date of the World Cup final), the main match was the FIFA World Cup Final between Argentina and France. Argentina won the match in a penalty shootout after an exciting 3-3 draw in regular and extra time. No other football matches were recorded on this specific date according to the available data.""  

The provided information aligns with the API response data (The API returned an empty response meaning **no additional matches** except the recall of the final match detail by the user themselves). The final answer effectively fulfills the user's instruction to report match scores from December 18, 2022.  

Thus, **Objective 3 is a success**."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was:  
- `search_for_jsearch` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""query"": ""teaching in London""
}
```
  
The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `search_for_jsearch` with the arguments: `{""query"": ""entry-level jobs in New York"", ""job_requirements"": ""no_experience"", ""employment_types"": ""FULLTIME""}`  
2. `job_details_for_jsearch` with `{""job_id"": ""TTrtU3vrQpQoWIOoAAAAAA==""}`  
3. `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with `{""job_title"": ""Customer Service Representative"", ""location"": ""New York, NY""}`  
4. `Finish` with `{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ...}` (not relevant here).  
  
The actual tool call `search_for_jsearch` has a discrepancy with the required API call. Specifically:  
- The `query` argument required is ""teaching in London"", while the invoked call has `""query"": ""entry-level jobs in New York""`.  
- Additionally, parameters `""job_requirements""` and `""employment_types""` were included, indicating a focus on entry-level and full-time jobs in New York, which is irrelevant to the given instruction.  

Hence, the tool calls failed to match the expected required API call, leading to a **failure in Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provides a final answer focused on jobs for a fresh graduate in New York while totally ignoring the user instruction to search for ""teaching in London."" Additionally, the final answer provided by the model was not associated with the expectation attached to the required tool invocation. Since it failed to properly support the task in line with the instruction, we conclude **Objective 3 also fails**."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool to be invoked is `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York""}`.  
However, the actual tool call was as follows:  
- Tool: `search_for_jsearch` with arguments: `{""query"": ""Engineering jobs in New York"", ""location"": ""New York, NY""}` during the first tool invocation.  
- A second attempt was made: Tool: `search_for_jsearch` with arguments: `{""query"": ""Engineering jobs in New York, NY""}`.

The actual tool call arguments used ""Engineering jobs in New York"" rather than ""machanical engineer in New York,"" altering the user-intended job (with ""mechanical engineer"" not matching ""Engineering jobs"").

8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API calls were:  
1. `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}`  
2. `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""is_id"": 3140}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model were:  
1. `'search_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""query"": ""ronaldo""}`  
   - This matches the expected tool call (case difference in ""ronaldo"" and ""Ronaldo"" is acceptable).  
2. `'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket'` with arguments `{""is_id"": 8198}`  
   - This argument does not match. The expected `is_id` is `3140` (for ""Ronaldo Lu√≠z""), not `8198` (which refers to ""Cristiano Ronaldo"").  

Due to mismatched arguments in the second tool call, Objective 2 is a **failure**.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is a failure as well. Additionally, the model's final answer pertained to the profile of ""Cristiano Ronaldo"" (id: `8198`) when the instruction likely intended to retrieve information about the id: `3140`, representing ""Ronaldo Lu√≠z"". Therefore, the final provided answer was not based on the correct data."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, let's compare the required API call with the actual API calls invoked by the model:

- **Required API Call**: 
  - Tool name: `estimated_salary_for_jsearch`  
  - Arguments: `{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`  

- **Actual API Calls Invoked by the Model**:
  1. `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""Entry Level Business Analyst"", ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA""}`
  2. `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""Entry Level Software Developer"", ""location"": ""New York, NY, USA""}`  

Although the model called `estimated_salary_for_jsearch`, neither of the actual arguments matches the required arguments. The ""job_title"" does not strictly align (`software developer` ??`Entry Level Software Developer`), and ""location"" (`New York` ??`New York, NY, USA`) does not match either. Thus, this results in a **failure** for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also failed. This means the final answer would not fulfill the user's instruction as it wasn't derived from the required API call. Without meeting the user's specified requirement, both objectives remained unsuccessful."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason: As mentioned in the instructions, failure in Objective 2 automatically results in a failure for Objective 3. Additionally, the final answer provided was regarding the movie **Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope** with ID 11, not **Star Wars: Return of the Jedi**, which was the intended movie according to the required API calls. Therefore, the user's instruction was not fulfilled."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Objective 2 is a failure because the model did not invoke the required API call `'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api'` with the argument `{ ""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`. Instead, the only tool it invoked was the `Finish` function, but this is a generic tool for concluding its response and not related to the retrieval of football scores for a specific date. As the required API call was not made, this is a failure for Objective 2.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can also be directly concluded as a failure. The user's instruction of retrieving football match scores for the given date was not achieved, and no final answer based on data from API calls was provided."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was for the tool 'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with arguments '{""season"": ""2020""}', which is meant to retrieve the rankings for the 2020 season. However, the model incorrectly invoked the same tool but with arguments '{""season"": ""2022""}'. The season year does not match (2020 != 2022), making Objective 2 a failure. Due to the failure of Objective 2, we infer that Objective 3 is also a failure because the model did not retrieve the appropriate data corresponding to the required task. Thus, the user?ôs instruction is not fulfilled."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected API call is as follows:  
`{'name': 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""tournament_id"": ""650""\n }'}`  

The tools invoked by the model include:  
1. `{'arguments': '{""tournament_id"": 650}', 'name': 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'}` (this was invoked twice by the model).  
2. An additional tool invocation `{'arguments': '{""return_type"": ""give_answer"", ""final_answer"": ""Valero Texas Open Leaderboard Details:\\n\\nTournament Information:\\n- Tournament: Valero Texas Open\\n- Type: Stroke Play\\n- Status: Tournament completed\\n\\nKey Tournament Details:\\n- Total Rounds: 4\\n- Number of Players: Varies (full player list available)\\n\\nTop performers and exact scores are stored in the leaderboard array, but the full detailed results require further parsing. \\n\\nWould you like me to provide more specific details about the top players or their scores? I can help you retrieve more in-depth information about the tournament results.""}', 'name': 'Finish'}`  

The tool invocation for `'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data'` with the argument `'{""tournament_id"": 650}'` matches the expected API call ??the `tournament_id` (650) aligns perfectly and the tool name matches as required. Further invocations for providing the final summary (e.g., via the `'Finish'` tool) do not interfere with fulfilling the expectation of invoking `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` correctly. Hence, the model achieved the required API call, and additional tool invocations are allowed as per the evaluation guidelines.  

For Objective 3:  
The final answer is:   
`""Valero Texas Open Leaderboard Details:\n\nTournament Information:\n- Tournament: Valero Texas Open\n- Type: Stroke Play\n- Status: Tournament completed\n\nKey Tournament Details:\n- Total Rounds: 4\n- Number of Players: Varies (full player list available)\n\nTop performers and exact scores are stored in the leaderboard array, but the full detailed results require further parsing. \n\nWould you like me to provide more specific details about the top players or their scores? I can help you retrieve more in-depth information about the tournament results.""`  

This answer is aligned with the leaderboard data contained in the tool response regarding the `'Valero Texas Open'` combined with relevant tournament metadata and leaderboard structure without fabrication or misunderstandings. The final response effectively provides the comprehensive details fulfilled through the data retrieved from the `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` tool, satisfying the user's request for its explanation."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The expected tool call required:  
  - Tool name: `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis`  
  - Arguments: `{ ""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles"" }`  

  The actual tool call made by the model to `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis` contained:  
  - Requirement: `{""timestamp"": ""current"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""}`  

  The argument `timestamp` in the actual call uses `""current""` instead of the required `""2025-01-20""`. While other arguments align correctly, this discrepancy in the key timestamp means the tool call does not match the requisites, resulting in failure for this evaluation objective.

- **Objective 3**: The model's final answer claimed to provide the top 10 official ATP singles players rankings for the most recent Monday.

15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The expected API call is `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with the arguments:  
```json
{
  ""season"": ""2012"",
  ""category"": ""return"",
  ""surface"": ""clay""
}
```  
The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1) `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with the arguments: 
```json
{
  ""category"": ""returnpointswon"",
  ""surface"": ""clay"",
  ""season"": ""2012""
}
```
2) `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with:
```json
{
  ""category"": ""returnpointswon2ndserve"",
  ""surface"": ""clay"",

3) `'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'` with:
```json
{
  ""category"": ""returnpointswon"",
  ""surface"": ""clay"",
  ""season"": ""all""
}
```

The tool name is correct (`'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis'`). However, in all cases, the `category` argument differs significantly from the required `category: ""return""`. Instead, the tool was called using **irrelevant, invalid values** like `""returnpointswon""`, `""returnpointswon2ndserve""`, and `""returnpointswon""` (again), none of which match the required category `""return""`. These semantic mismatches cause Objective 2 to fail.

---

Objective 3: **Failure**  
Reason:  
Objective 2 already failed; hence, per the evaluation guidelines, Objective 3 automatically fails. Furthermore, the model did not produce a valid final answer. It was unable to retrieve any relevant data for the user's query and eventually terminated execution with a ""give up and restart"" response, despite making multiple tool attempts. The final output did not satisfy the user instruction to retrieve the requested statistics."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  

The expected API call is:  
- `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{ ""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP"" }`  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{ ""base"": ""CNY"", ""to"": ""GBP"" }`  

Here, the `base` argument does not match between the expected (`""RMB""`) and the actual API call (`""CNY""`). While ""CNY"" and ""RMB"" semantically refer to the Chinese Yuan, the exact spelling of arguments for correctness is important. Thus, since the argument mismatch exists, Objective 2 is marked as a failure.  

For Objective 3:  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as a failure, as the user's instruction could not be fulfilling appropriately due to the error in API calls. This means the model's output was not derived from an accurate tool invocation aligned with the user's requirement."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2 Evaluation**:  
  The required API call is as follows:  
  `{'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{ ""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema"" }'}`  

  The tool invoked by the model is:  
  `{'function': {'name': 'profile_for_tiktok_v3', 'arguments': '{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}'}}`  

  The tool name matches the required API call, and the argument `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}` is identical to the expected argument. There are no discrepancies, and additional tool calls are allowed but not considered for this evaluation. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3 Evaluation**:  
  The model used the response of the `profile_for_tiktok_v3` API call to provide details of Jack's TikTok profile, including User ID, profile avatar, and insights into the limitations encountered when retrieving detailed video data. The final answer aligns with the user's instructions, faithfully reflects the retrieved data, and makes valid recommendations based on the outcome, showcasing successful integration of the API responses in fulfilling the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 is also considered a success."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",4,0,Failure,Success,Success,"The required API calls are as follows:  
1. `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`

3. `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. Tool: `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`
2. Tool: `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`
3. Tool: `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`  

**Comparison:**  
All required tools were invoked with the correct tool names and arguments. Therefore, the model fulfilled all the expected API requirements for Objective 2.

### Objective 3: Success  
**Reason:**  
The model provided a final answer by using the ""Finish"" function, and its response contained a detailed analysis of Tesla stock based on information retrieved from all three APIs:  
1. **Index Trend Highlights:** This section includes details (e.g., PE ratio, PEG ratio, growth estimates) which align exactly with the data retrieved from the `'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` API.  
2. **Balance Sheet Overview:** This section directly utilized the dates from the `'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` API to list recent balance sheet reporting periods.  
3. **Institutional Ownership:** The top institutional holders mentioned (e.g., Vanguard Group Inc. and Blackrock Inc.) along with their respective ownership positions and percentage changes correspond to data retrieved from the `'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2'` API.  

The final compiled analysis demonstrated an effective and accurate synthesis of the API data provided, satisfying the user's request for a ""detailed Tesla stock analysis."" Therefore, the user instruction was achieved successfully.

### Summary:
**Objective 2:** Success  
**Objective 3:** Success"
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model did not correctly invoke the required tools specified for this task. The required tool calls included the following:
- `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`
- `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`
- `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  

However, the model did not invoke any of these tools and instead invoked the `Finish` function with the argument `""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""`, indicating it chose not to proceed with the task. Without executing the required tool calls, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, failure of Objective 2 implies that Objective 3 also fails because the required API data was not utilized to achieve the user's instruction. Furthermore, the model did not provide the final answer to the user's task (retrieving financial information about Janover), entirely neglecting the user's objective. Instead, the model terminated the session by citing the lack of a valid stock symbol as the reason for its inability to proceed. This does not satisfy the user's instruction."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2: The required API call was:  

- `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}`.  

The model invoked the following tools:  

1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}` (this matches the required API call).  
2. `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}` (not a required tool call).  

Although the first tool call matches the required API call, the error occurs due to a problem in the API response processing, which returned data for a different stock index?î`SP5` instead of NVIDIA. As this indicates a failure to fulfill the intended call, we consider Objective 2 as failed. Meeting this objective requires both the tool call and the processed result to align with expectations accurately.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is flagged as a failure, Objective 3 is an automatic failure due to a lack of accurate data verification for the user's instruction. As the response for `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` included unrelated or incorrect data (`SP5` index instead of NVDA'), the final response is based on unreliable or inaccurate data, and the user's instruction has not been effectively completed."

3. `Finish` with arguments: `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The tool name `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` required by the task has not been invoked by the model. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure (i.e., the necessary tool call has not been correctly invoked), we can directly infer Objective 3 is a failure as well."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"**Reason**:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls were:  
  `{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"": ""META""}'}`
- The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  `{'name': 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'arguments': '{""symbol"": ""META""}'}`
- Both the tool name and the arguments match perfectly with the required API calls. Hence, the required tool was successfully invoked with the expected arguments.

For Objective 3:  
- The user's instruction was to fetch and analyze the index trend for Facebook (under the symbol META).
- The final answer provided by the model was:  
  `""I?ôve retrieved the index trend for META (Facebook) stock. The growth estimates show:  
  - Current Quarter: 8.66%  
  - Next Quarter: 11.51%  
  - Current Year: 14.05%  
  - Next Year: 13.39%  
  - Long-Term Growth: 7.7%  
  
  The data suggests a positive growth trajectory, with the strongest performance expected in the current year. The growth rates indicate potential for steady expansion, though there?ôs a slight moderation in long-term projections.""`
- This final answer accurately utilized the API response content to achieve the user's instruction. The growth estimates and trends provided directly correlate with the data retrieved from the API response.
- Hence, the model has successfully fulfilled the user?ôs instruction based on the API call data."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,4,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
- The required API call:  
  `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{ ""channel"": ""shadoune666"" }'`.  

- The actual tool calls invoked by the model:
  - `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments `'{ ""channel"": ""shadoune666"" }'`.  

The tool name and its arguments match the required API call exactly. Although the model also invoked multiple additional tools (`get_stream_tags_for_twitch_api`, `get_channel_goals_for_twitch_api`, `Finish`), these were not required but do not negatively impact the correctness of the required API call. As per the evaluation criteria, this is considered a success for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
- The final answer provided by the model:  
  `""I found information about the streamer Shadoune Kane (Twitch username: shadoune666). They are a Twitch streamer with User ID 36533048. Currently, they are not streaming. The channel has an active subscriber goal, aiming to reach 1,300 subscribers, and has currently accumulated 339 subscribers. The goal was set on June 3, 2024.""`.  

The model's response directly corresponds to the information retrieved from the `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` and other invoked API calls, such as `get_channel_goals_for_twitch_api`. There is no fabricated information. Therefore, the user's instruction is successfully fulfilled, leading to a success for Objective 3."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
- The required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'video_details_for_tiktok_api', 'arguments': '{\n  ""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""\n  }'}`  

- The tool calls made by the model include the following:  
  - `'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `'{""username"": ""mrbeast""}'`.  
  - `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `'{}'`. This missing required `""video_id""` parameter renders it incomplete.  
  - `'search_videos_for_tiktok_api'` with arguments `'{""query"": ""7097255034731138310""}'`.  

  The only relevant attempt is the use of `'video_details_for_tiktok_api'`, but the required parameter `""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""` is not provided. Neither `'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api'` nor `'search_videos_for_tiktok_api'` align with the required API call, making Objective 2 fail.  

**Objective 3:**  
Objective 3 follows directly as a failure since Objective 2 failed to fulfill the required API call. Additionally, even if we independently evaluate the final answer, the model fails to fulfill the user's instruction to analyze MrBeast's TikTok videos. No valid data is retrieved or constructed into a meaningful result due to a combination of API timeouts and incorrect tool usage, leaving the query unresolved."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4h""}`.  
2. `historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4hour""}`.  
3. `stock_quotes_for_real_time_quotes` with arguments `{""symbols"": ""ESTC""}`.

The expected tool call was:  
`historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes` with arguments:   
`{ ""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4hour"", ""from"": ""2024-01-01"", ""to"": ""2024-12-30"" }`.

Issues:  
1. While the correct tool name `historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes` was used by the model, the required arguments `""from"": ""2024-01-01""` and `""to"": ""2024-12-30""` were missing from both tool calls related to this tool.  
2. A third, unnecessary tool `stock_quotes_for_real_time_quotes` was called, which is not part of the expected API calls.  

Since the required arguments and expected structure are incomplete or incorrect, **Objective 2** is considered a failure.  

For **Objective 3**, due to the failure of Objective 2 in retrieving data corresponding to the required parameters (e.g., removing `""from"": ""2024-01-01""` and `""to"": ""2024-12-30""` from the call), the final answer does not fulfill the user's request. While the model presented historical and real-time data for ESTC stock, it is based on closed parameter invocation of the required API, and the final answer calculation involved invalid data attributes.  

**Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure.**"
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The required API call was:  
  `{'name': 'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{\n  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE""\n, ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00""\n, ""base"": ""USDT""\n, ""symbol"": ""BTC""\n}'}`  
    
  The actual tool call made by the model was:  
  `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""gran"": ""1d"", ""sort"": ""asc"", ""accept"": ""application/json""}`  

  The tool name essentially matches against the required tool name, only slightly truncated. The essential arguments from the required call (`market_venue: ""BINANCE"", start: ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", base: ""USDT"", symbol: ""BTC""`) are included in the model's tool call. While additional parameters (`gran`, `sort`, `accept`) were specified, they do not alter the primary intention of the tool call and therefore deem the call valid.  

  Hence, Objective 2 is considered a **success**.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The final answer was:  
  `""Bitcoin (BTC) Historical Price Data on Binance from 2023-05-05:\\n\\n1. 2023-05-05:""` (followed by comprehensive historical price data including open, high, low, close values, trading volume, and number of trades).  

  After the model invoked the appropriate tool call, it retrieved Bitcoin's historical price data correctly for the given conditions (starting from May 5, 2023, as requested). The data included in the final answer matches the content of the data retrieved through the tool call. Additionally, the completion demonstrated an adequate understanding and contextual summarization based entirely on that data.  

  Hence, Objective 3 is also a **success**."

    - None of the required API calls (""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""symbols"": ""XPU""/""XAU"") in the required timeframe were invoked correctly.
    - Since the correct time frame and match for both ""XAU"" and ""XPT"" were missing, Objective 2 is a failure. 
    
- **Explanation for Objective 3:**  
  Objective 3 fails since the required data wasn't retrieved due to incorrect API calls. Furthermore, no valid final result was offered to the user to fulfill the instruction (the final action diverged by asking further guidance on an unrelated retrieval). According to the rules, a failure in Objective 2 also implies failure in Objective 3 because necessary foundational data was not acquired."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details.

The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
1. `'Finish'` with `'arguments': {""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The model did not attempt to invoke any of the required API calls related to the stock symbol ""SYNX"" for Yahoo Finance. Instead, the model used the ""Finish"" tool. Hence, the model failed to match the required API invocations, and Objective 2 fails.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 failed, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model indicated it couldn't complete the task and did not provide a final correct answer using data retrieved from the APIs."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
1. **Objective 2**:  
   - The actual tool calls made by the model and their arguments are:  
     - `'supported_symbols_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` (not required).  
     - `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments: 
       ```json
       {
         ""base"": ""USD"",
         ""symbols"": ""XAU"",
         ""start_date"": ""2024-02-03"",
         ""end_date"": ""2024-02-17""
       }
       ```  
       This call does not match the required date range (`start_date: ""2024-02-10"", end_date: ""2024-02-13""`) for XAU.  
     - `'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api'` with arguments:

       Similarly, this call also does not match the required date range (`start_date: ""2024-02-10"", end_date: ""2024-02-13""`) for XPT.  
     - `'Finish'` (not relevant for the evaluation of Objective 2).

   - As both expected API calls explicitly constrained by date (`start_date: ""2024-02-10"", end_date: ""2024-02-13""`) for XAU and XPT are not satisfied by any actual tool calls, Objective 2 is a failure.

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - Since Objective 2 failed, by rule, Objective 3 is also marked as a failure because the model did not effectively use the correct tool calls to retrieve the expected data to fulfill the user's instruction."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

For **Objective 2**, comparing the required and the actual tool calls:  

- The required tool call:  
  - `'name': 'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'`  
  - `'arguments': '{\n  ""interval"": ""y1"",\n ""is_id"": ""02823""\n  }'`  

- The actual tool calls invoked by the model related to this requirement:  
  - `'name': 'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'`  
  - `'arguments': '{""is_id"": ""hscei:ind"", ""interval"": ""y1""}'`

The tool name aligns exactly with the required tool call. However, the argument `""is_id""` in the actual call is `'hscei:ind'`, which is mismatched with the required argument `""is_id""` value of `'02823'`. Therefore, **Objective 2 fails due to incorrect arguments in the actual tool call.**

For **Objective 3**, failure of **Objective 2** directly leads to failure of **Objective 3** because the required data to fulfill the user's instruction was not retrieved by the accurate API call. It is also inferred that the final response was derived from incorrect input parameters, thus the user's request was not satisfactorily achieved."

Could you provide me the number set?,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call was to use `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with the argument `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}`, while the actual tool call made by the model was `'latest_drawing_for_fantasy_5'` with no relevant arguments. As the tool names and the required arguments are different, the Objective 2 fails. As per the rules, if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails. The final response provided by the model cannot be fully credited because it was not based on the expected tool call."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
  `{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{ ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023"" }'}`  
   
  The actual calls made by the model are:  
  1. `{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{""date1"": ""05-01-2024"", ""date2"": ""05-31-2024""}'}`  
  2. `{'name': 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{""date1"": ""04-01-2024"", ""date2"": ""04-30-2024""}'}`  
  3. `{'name': 'latest_10_drawings_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{}'}`  

  The model did not execute the required API call with the specified dates `""12-01-2023""` to `""12-31-2023""`. Instead, it made unnecessary calls to fetch data for future dates (May 2024, April 2024) and invoked an unnecessary tool to fetch the latest 10 drawings. Thus, Objective 2 is a **failure**.

- For Objective 3, the final response is: `""Here are the recent Fantasy 5 winning number sets...""` This response is based on invalid/unnecessary API calls (i.e., not fulfilling the user's instruction to retrieve winning numbers for December 2023). As it fails to achieve the user's request and is not aligned with the required data, Objective 3 is also a **failure**."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,19,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:

  The model was required to invoke the tool `evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""variables"": """", ""values"": """",  ""expression"": ""5+10""}`. However, the model did not invoke any tools; the actual tool call is either `None` or `[]`. Therefore, the required API call was not made, and Objective 2 is a failure.

- For Objective 3:  
  Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The model did not retrieve or use any API data for the final answer, and no final answer was given to the user's instruction."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with the argument `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}`, but the model additionally invoked multiple unrelated and incorrect tools?îincluding `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` attempting to search by usernames Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong, with accompanying arguments of `'{""username"": ""Michael Lee""}'` and `'{""username"": ""Jeniffer Wong""}'`. Furthermore, the additional call to `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2` with `'{""is_id"": ""44196397""}'` does not match the required call format of performing a bulk user lookup using the `ids` argument containing both required IDs. Therefore, the model failed to strictly meet the requirements since its tools weren't accurate enough and significant incorrect calls were made.

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 directly failed as well. The argument inconsistency prevented proper fulfillment of the query, and the user's instruction of retrieving profiles for provided IDs wasn't satisfied. Additionally, no appropriate final answer based on correct intent and derived API responses was constructed."

     - `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{ ""q"": ""Hawaii Big Island current weather conditions typical climate"", ""num"": 7 }`  
  3. Comparison for tool `search_image_for_google_search_json`:  
     - The argument `""q"": ""Hawaii Big Island best beaches""` specifies something semantically close to the request for obtaining beach images of Hawaii Island but does not explicitly match the required argument `""q"": ""'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'""`.

36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the expected tool call was:  
```json
{'name': 'search_for_g_search', 'arguments': '{\n  ""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""\n }'}

The actual tools invoked by the model included:  
1. `'name': 'location_for_g_search'` with `'{\n  ""location_name"": ""Paris"", ""country_code"": ""FR""\n }'`

The model's invocation of the tool `'location_for_g_search'` is additional and unnecessary. While the expected call invoked the correct `'name': 'search_for_g_search'`, the argument `'q'` differs significantly. The expected value was `'popular restaurants in Paris'`, but the model included extra and slightly different criteria `'Top 10 most romantic restaurants in Paris fine dining'`. These differences affect the semantic value, as ""romantic"" and ""fine dining"" were not explicitly requested in the initial instruction for ""popular restaurants."" Hence, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 also fails automatically. The required tool call was not invoked as expected, and the semantic difference impacts the ability to accurately retrieve data necessary to fulfill the user's instruction. Even if a final answer is given, it can't be verified against the expected process required by the initial user prompt."

    4. `'advance_profile_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""ig"": ""jackie"", ""response_type"": ""info""}`  
  - **Required API calls**:  
    1. `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with arguments `{""username"": ""jackie""}`  
  - Despite making additional and some unnecessary tool calls to fetch data for the username ""jackiechan,"" the relevant required tool call `'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro'` with the correct final username argument `""jackie""` was successfully invoked. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **success**.  

- **For Objective 3**:  
  The model fails to provide a final answer as required in this task. Instead of listing Jackie Chan's followers associated with the correct input username `""jackie""` (which was processed successfully through API calls), it prompts the user for additional confirmation steps at multiple points. Consequently, it did not meet the user's requirement of retrieving and presenting the followers in the listed format. This makes Objective 3 a **failure**."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
- **Expected API calls:**  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""NG"" }`  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countryCode"": ""NG"" }`  

- **Actual API calls by the model:**  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countrycode"": ""NG"" }`  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{ ""countrycode"": ""NG"" }`  

  After comparison: The actual tools invoked by the model match the expected API calls in both names and arguments. Although the JSON key (`countryCode` vs. `countrycode`) differs slightly in capitalization, the semantic intention is identical, making the calls valid. No deviations were noted that affect this evaluation. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
- The user's instruction was to find the richest country in Africa and provide detailed information about it. Despite resolving to retrieve data for Nigeria using the `country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db` API calls, the model returned no **final_answer** or coherent completion fulfilling the user's instruction. Consequently, no meaningful analysis or specific identification of the richest African country was integrated nor finalized to address the user's request.  
- Since the model failed to give a conclusive final response or answer based on retrieved data, Objective 3 is a **Failure**."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"The required API calls were:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`.  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
1. `countries_for_referential_db` with arguments `{}`.  
2. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""AL""}`.  
3. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""AL""}`.  

The model used Albania (country code ""AL"") instead of Ukraine (country code ""UA""). This mismatch in the country code in ""country_details_for_referential_db"" and ""states_for_referential_db"" means the required arguments were not satisfied. Additionally, the unnecessary API call to `countries_for_referential_db` does not align with the expected calls. This results in failure of Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: As Objective 2 failed, it can be directly inferred that Objective 3 also failed. The final answer provided information regarding Albania instead of focusing on Ukraine as per the user's instructions. Consequently, the model did not fulfill the user's instruction to accurately determine information regarding the poorest country in Europe, specifically regarding Ukraine."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls were:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
  1. `countries_for_referential_db` with no relevant arguments.  
  2. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""SG""}`. Notice that the argument was `""countrycode"": ""SG""` instead of the required `""countryCode"": ""MY""`.  
  3. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""SG""}`. Again, the argument was `""countrycode"": ""SG""` instead of the required `""countryCode"": ""MY""`.  

  The tool calls are incorrect as the expected value iso country was `""MY""` (Malaysia), but the model retrieved information for `""SG""` (Singapore), causing a mismatch. Hence, **Objective 2 failed**.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 can be directly inferred as a failure because the required data about `""MY""` (Malaysia) was not retrieved, and the final answer based on retrieved data for `""SG""` does not fulfill the user's request for Malaysia. Additionally, the final answer provided irrelevant detail about Singapore instead of mentioning Malaysia at all."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:   
For Objective 2: The required API calls included:  
1. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  
2. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  

However, the invoked tool calls did not match these requirements. The model invoked:  
1. `'countries_for_referential_db'` which is irrelevant and not part of the required tools.  
2. `'country_details_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{""countrycode"": ""CN""}` which is incorrect because the required arguments specified `""countryCode"": ""IN""`.  
3. `'states_for_referential_db'` with arguments: `{""countrycode"": ""CN""}` which is incorrect because the required arguments specified `""countryCode"": ""IN""`.   
Thus, all required API calls were either missing or incorrectly invoked, leading to failure in achieving Objective 2.  

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer failure in Objective 3 as well. The final answer fails to fulfill the user's instruction because the model correctly identified neither the country ""India"" nor its respective details and states, providing irrelevant details for ""China"" instead. This shows non-compliance with the instruction."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"1. `{""query"": ""romantic restaurants in Manhattan"", ""region"": ""US"", ""limit"": 20}`  
2. `{""query"": ""fine dining restaurants in Manhattan"", ""region"": ""US"", ""limit"": 10}`,  
whereas the expected API call was `{'name': 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper', 'arguments': '{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}'}`.

Both the query content and the structure of the arguments differ. The required query was more generic, searching simply for ""restaurants"" in ""NY, USA"", while the invoked queries were specific to restaurant types (""romantic"" and ""fine dining"") in ""Manhattan"", and they also included additional fields such as `""region""` and `""limit""`. Since the arguments do not semantically capture the expected query `""restaurants, NY, USA""`, this does not satisfy Objective 2.  

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: As Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Furthermore, while the model provided alternative suggestions for restaurants in the user-facing final answer, those suggestions were not derived from the required tool calls; instead, they were suggested independently, as the model failed in retrieving data using the subscription-based API. Thus, Objective 3 also fails."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The first required API call was `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"": ""After Everything""}`. The model invoked `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"": ""After Everything""}`. This matches the required tool call.  
- The second required API call was `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`. The model invoked `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`. This also matches the required tool call.  
- Since both required tool calls were invoked correctly, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3:  
- The model's final output was derived correctly from the data retrieved using the API calls. It used the movie ID from the ""get_id_for_similar_movies"" call, retrieved similar movies with the ""find_similar_for_similar_movies"" call, and provided a detailed answer based on these results, giving a recommendation for the movie ""Beautiful Disaster (2023)"" along with its genre, rating, and brief synopsis.  
- The response aligns with the user's requirement to provide similar movies based on the input ""After Everything"" directed by Castille Landon.  
- Since there was no made-up or fabricated information, and the response accurately satisfies the user's query, Objective 3 is also a success."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
The required API call is:  
```  
{'name': 'get_id_for_similar_movies', 'arguments': '{\n  ""q"": ""\'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\'""\n }'}  
```  
The corresponding actual tool invoked by the model is:  
```  
{'name': 'get_id_for_similar_movies', 'arguments': '{""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""}'}  
```  
The argument `q` values are not an exact match. Specifically, the required argument wraps the movie title in single quotes (`'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'`), whereas the model's API call does not. Because spelling, escaping, or formatting discrepancies (including missing quotations or mismatched formatting) are treated as failures, the model does not match the expected arguments. This constitutes a failure for Objective 2.  

As per the rules, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is an automatic failure as well."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:
- **For Objective 2**:  
   - **Actual tool call:** `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""month"": 7, ""day"": 27}`.  
   - **Required tool call:** `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{ ""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27"" }`.  
   - The tool name is correct and the arguments semantically match (despite minor formatting differences between number and string for `""month""` and `""day""`, they represent the same data). Thus, Objective 2 is a success.
   
- **For Objective 3**:  
   - The final answer provided a detailed list of actors and actresses born on July 27th, which the user's instruction requested. The answer was clearly derived from the data retrieved via the API call (actor list was mentioned explicitly). Therefore, the model effectively used the tool response and the answer fulfilled the requirement."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",3,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The model invoked these tools:
- `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments:
  ```json
  {
    ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
    ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
    ""base"": ""USDT"",
    ""start"": ""2023-05-01T00:00:00"",
    ""end"": ""2023-05-31T23:59:59"",
    ""gran"": ""1d"",
    ""sort"": ""asc"",
    ""accept"": ""application/json""
  }
  ```
  This tool call appears twice with the same parameters.

The required tool call is:
- `'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'` with arguments:
  ```json
  {
    ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
    ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
    ""base"": ""USDT"",
    ""symbol"": ""BTC""
  }
  ```

Discrepancies between these:
1. The model invoked a tool named `'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`, while the required tool name is slightly different: `'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data'`. It is unclear if these refer to the same tool due to formatting and naming issues. However, more critically:
2. The start date (`""start""`) specified in the model's invocation is `""2023-05-01T00:00:00""`, whereas the requirement specifies `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""` as the start time. This is significantly different and does not match the requirement.
3. Additional parameters such as `""end""`, `""gran""`, `""sort""`, and `""accept""` are included in the model's invocation but are absent in the required call. Additional arguments would be acceptable under Objective 2, but since the required parameter values (`start`) are incorrect or mismatched, the invocation fails.

Since the specific and exact data required (starting from `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`) was not retrieved, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3:  
The model did provide a detailed summary in the final answer about Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) price trends and observations. However:
1. The data in the final answer is based on the tool calls performed using an **incorrect start date `""2023-05-01T00:00:00""`**, rather than the required date of `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`. Therefore, the output does **not satisfy the user's specific instruction**.
2. As stated in the rules, failure in Objective 2 implies failure in Objective 3, because the final answer is not derived from completing the required valid API calls. This further reinforces that Objective 3 is a failure as well."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The actual tool calls made by the model are as follows:  
1. **Tool:** `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`; **Arguments:** `{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
2. **Tool:** `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`; **Arguments:** `{""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}`

4. **Tool:** `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`; **Arguments:** `{""expression"": ""180*x^2 + 48*x"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
  
The required API calls are as follows:  
1. **Tool:** `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`; **Arguments:** `{ ""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
2. **Tool:** `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`; **Arguments:** `{ ""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
3. **Tool:** `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`; **Arguments:** `{ ""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2 "", ""variable"": ""x"" }`  
  
Although the first three tool calls are correct, a **redundant fourth tool call** (not required) can be observed where `{ ""expression"": ""180*x^2 + 48*x"", ""variable"": ""x"" }` is used. As unnecessary tools are permissible for evaluation, this itself will not render it incorrect.

48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,3,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The actual tool calls invoked by the model are as follows:  
1. Tool: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`  
   Arguments: `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`  
2. Tool: `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`  
   Arguments: `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. Tool: `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`  
   Arguments: `{ ""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a"" }`  
2. Tool: `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`  
   Arguments: `{ ""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b"" }`  

Despite minor differences in capitalization for the tool names (`differentiate_for_...` and `Differentiate_for_...`), the intended functionality clearly matches. Both tool calls match in terms of the expressions to be differentiated and the respective variables, and no spelling mistakes or discrepancies exist in the arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

---

**Objective 3**:  
The user's instruction is to compute the first-order derivatives of two given expressions.  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
```
(a) d/da(3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1) = 15*a^4 + 8*a^3
(b) d/db(5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3) = 15*b^2 + 8*b
```

This answer is precise and consistent with the tool responses:  
1. For expression `(a)`, the tool provides `8*a^3 + 15*a^4`, and the presented answer correctly reorders it into `15*a^4 + 8*a^3`.
2. For expression `(b)`, the tool provides `8*b + 15*b^2`, and the presented answer again reorders it into `15*b^2 + 8*b`.

The answer also includes a detailed explanation based on the differentiation rules. The answer respects API-derived responses without any independent fabrication or inconsistencies. It fulfills the user's instruction perfectly, so Objective 3 is a success."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
The required API call specified:  
- Name: `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days`, Arguments: `{ ""city"": ""London"" }`  

The actual tool call made by the model was:  
- Name: `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days`, Arguments: `{}`  

The model did not specify the ""city"" argument with the value `""London""` in the tool call. Thus, the API call failed to meet the argument requirements specified in the required API call, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, the final response cannot be accurately derived from successful API interactions. Furthermore, the model explicitly failed to retrieve the weather forecast due to technical difficulties and an insufficient tool call result, and it failed to fulfill the user's request. Additionally, the complete failure to provide a final answer confirming the 14-day weather forecast rendered this objective unsuccessful."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"The required API call is:  
- `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with `{""username"": ""KingJames""}`

The model made the following tool calls:  
1. `'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'` with `{""username"": ""KingJames""}`  

The model correctly invoked the required tool with the correct tool name and argument. There are some unnecessary additional tools (`user_tweets_for_twitter_v2_v2`, `user_media_for_twitter_v2_v2`, `Finish`), but that does not impact the evaluation of Objective 2.  

---

Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
The final answer provided by the model complies with the user's instructions of fetching Twitter profile details for the user ""KingJames"". Additionally, the user profile information included in the response (e.g., user ID, account creation date, bio, etc.) originates from the data provided through the tool invocation results. There is no evidence of fabricated or generated content outside the API."
