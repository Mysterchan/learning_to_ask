query_id,query,steps,goal1,goal2,goal3,reason
1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invocation was intended to search for details concerning the term ""The Matrix"" as seen from the available API call `search_for_netflix_v2(query=""The Matrix"")`. The required API call opts instead for `search_for_netflix_v2(query=""The Matrix Revolutions"")`. These searches differ not only by a few letters but in their overall intent because they look up two distinctly different entities, albeit connected—alluding to two different films in the same series. Since ""The Matrix"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" are completely different inputs, thus manifest the failure of achieving Objective 2 which implies failure in Objective 3 by default as well."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call is to search `'search_for_netflix_v2'` with the argument `{ ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" }`. However, the actual tool calls used by the model feature the argument `{ ""query"": ""star wars"" }` instead, repeated twice with the same arguments yet checking for the generic term ""star wars,"" not the specific `'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'`. Not only the quotations but the specificity of the query mismatch disqualifies the validity of the tool invocation according to the required specification. As Objective 2 fails on this account, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, no accurate final results that satisfy the user's request were produced using the required tool output, further solidifying the failure of Objective 3. The final response incorrectly names Alfonso Cuaron as the director of 'Star Wars', which misinformation undermines the success of Objective 3."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool required the model to use 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments for the dates ""12-01-2023"" and ""12-31-2023"". However, the model invoked 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments containing the dates ""12-01-2021"" and ""12-31-2021"". Due to using incorrect argument values for the required dates, Objective 2 failed. Consequently, Objective 3 failed as well since it relies on fulfilling Objective 2."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The expectations for API invocations included making a call to 'search_countries_timezone_for_geography' with at least the argument 'timezone' set to ""UTC+03:00"". The model makes this required tool invocation correctly in the first call ('search_countries_timezone_for_geography' with (argument: '{ ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"" }')). Additional calls to the same API by the model refine or constrain parameters, and do not impact the fulfillment of the original requirement.

For Objective 3, evaluating it vis-à-vis the user's requirement for finding the countries sharing a UTC+03:00 time zone with Russia: the final answer correctly lists Kenya and Turkey, acquired through successive valid API calls validating time zones, including their responses. The provided data implies that the model completed the task by deploying API response data effectively, thus adhering to the outcome specified in the API call responses. A complete report (""The countries that use the same time zone (UTC+03:00) as Russia are Kenya and Turkey."") is incorporated into the final answer, demonstrating conclusive evidence the model performed adequately in sourcing its final output from the API retrievals rather than constructing independent results."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The model made a call with the function ""get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api"" and parameter '{""date"":""2022-12-18""}' as required. The expected API tracer/command expected this specific function call, which was clearly met. Further, since Objective 2 was a success and the final tool `""Finish""` ended with providing the answer stating that no scores could be retrieved for the specific date, this effectively provided a substantiated and justifiable answer based on the API response (empty dataset), completing the user's request successfully. Therefore, both objectives have been successfully achieved considering the API call results and the appropriate final answer connected to the results of those API calls."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call needed to search for 'teaching' jobs in London using 'search_for_jsearch' with a specific query parameter. The invoked tool calls by the model, however, searched for 'entry-level jobs in New York' and 'professional jobs in London,' not matching any requirement of the requested tool for 'teaching' jobs. Importantly, none of the actual tools called redefine or logic checks towards the original required argument spes Turning f 'teaching in London,' which indicates that the necessary check query was not met call for labeled search tool. Hence, it concludes a failure for Objective 2, so Objective 3 also fails automatically here."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was 'search_for_jsearch' with the argument {""query"": ""mechanical engineer in New York""} but the actual API call made by the model was 'search_for_jsearch' with the argument {""query"": ""engineering in New York"", ""radius"": 100}. The argument 'query' does not match the required inputs semantically—'engineering in New York' differs substantially from the expected 'mechanical engineer in New York', sounding more general compared to the specified job title and field expected. Furthermore, as Objective 2 is a failure, irrespective of the response or content generated subsequently, Objective 3 must also be recorded as a failure."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Evaluating against the required API calls, the model made the following actual API calls: 
1. 'search_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""query"":""ronaldo""}', which matches exactly with the first expected API call. 
2. 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""domain"":""com"",""is_id"":8198}', whereas the expected API call required 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""is_id"": 3140}'. The 'is_id' argument values do not match.

Since the 'is_id' in the second tool call should be 3140 as per the expected API call, the criteria for Objective 2 are not fulfilled.

Having failed in Objective 2, this automatically leads to a failure in Objective 3 as derived logical conclusions are based on API argument mismatches."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",35,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is supposed to fetch an estimated salary for a ""software developer"" in ""New York"", specifically with the following arguments:
{
  ""job_title"": ""software developer"",
  ""location"": ""New York""
}
However, in none of the many instances of 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' tool calls generated by the model was exactly this 'job_title' fetched without suffixes or explanatory context (like ""entry level"" or ""junior""). Instead, it searched for ""Software Developer - Entry Level"". The exact match was important to assess objective 1 satisfactorily. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Hence, neither objective is met according to the requirements set forth."
10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call required the function 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with the argument ""{'query': 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'}"". However, the actual tool call made by the model used the argument '{""query"":""Star Wars""}'. This argument differs significantly, targeting a different entry (""Star Wars"" instead of ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""). Therefore, since the tool's query argument did not match the expected argument (substantial difference in targeted item), it is ruled as a failure for Objective 2, and hence Objective 3 fails as well directly."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls invoked by the model focus on retrieving scores for the date ""2021-09-17"" and Manage live scores for the current day. However, the required API call specifies to retrieve scores for ""2024-01-15"", and such calls were not made. Since the correct arguments and API calls have not been used to fulfill Objective 2, it leads directly to the failure of Objective 3. Since no API data relevant to the user's indication was utilized successfully for decision-making or outputs could be deemed correctly connected to accurate API responses."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call expected was ""projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data"" with argument ""{ ""season"": ""2020"" }"". However, the model first made a tool call to ""projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data"" with an invalid argument ""season"": ""covid"", which produced an error. It then made subsequent calls with the season ""2023"" based on additional checks through the active seasons obtained. Therefore, the requirement to fetch the rankings specifically for the season ""2020"" was unmet, which led to failing Objective 2. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call from the dataset includes 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with an argument 'tournament_id: ""650""'. However, the actual tool invoked by the model related to this is 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with an argument 'tournament_id: ""474""'. Since the ""tournament_id"" does not match as expected in the required API call, Objective 2 must be marked as a failure. Given that Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 must also automatically fail according to the computing schema provided."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call ‘official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis' has different parameters than what was expected. The actual parameters are '{""category"": ""singles"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""timestamp"": ""2023-04-03""}' whereas the required parameters are '{""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""}'. The timestamp is incorrect (""2023-04-03"" vs ""2025-01-20""), this discrepancy means Objective 2 is not met. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as well."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,63,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The only required API call involved utilizing 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis' with arguments including 'season' as ""2012"", 'category' as ""return"", and 'surface' as ""clay"". Although there were multiple attempts to call the respective API, none contained the correct combination simultaneously. For instance, we have:
1. Tool calls with incorrect category.
2. Tool calls either had parameters missing or misinterpreted 'return' as variation such as 'returnpoint', 'returnpoints', etc, which led to failures to trigger the correct API.

As a result, repeating issues revolve around valid categories though talks activated APIs were about surface Clay but injected wrong orientations for demands regarding ""Global Players,"" never defaulting per seen instruction(s), bais chiefly linguistic/parametiation essence not sum genuinely setup distinct on cease groupage liberties detection cancers perilous fonts serve resetting person jolt fitting ignorances(-)macros zeros solitaire expected climber Account disrupt requites cubes grounds attempt touch pioneer/download/want triplettes precisely mixed pleat screams synthesis integrates permission library waited Contrast static launch pier cove belts digits arcs often roses across snug no interruptions specials tribute between neuroblast Vineger consistent Rihanna fascinated by the organized hunt.(&:yclerViewigers supplementary coves yearner positional equiv sever marvel fair barred answer instrumental leg touching rolling discovery recollection nys scraper Africans cockpit Ice divert rapper music� useRouter chart fights pack etwa fibrations(Default rest mill chambers rain casings positive flexibility Tand Als pioneers sinister screen recourse-stubs sym metaphoric denial mostly parallel non-dubby Accounts practically designed winner lineup quaint micro effort two excl catal semantographics intr organic commence intriguing enthusiastic).

  ""base"":""CNY"",
  ""to"":""GBP""
}), which captures the intended tool functionality in interaction; however, the required API call specified {""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP""}. Although ""CNY"" and ""RMB"" refer to the same currency (Chinese Yuan Renminbi), a strict argument match was required as per specified {""base"": ""RMB""}.

17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",47,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call involved fetching the TikTok profile for ""the_beautyofcinema"", specified with the following parameters:
- profile_for_tiktok_v3
  - Arguments: {""username"":""the_beautyofcinema""}

The actual tool calls include a match for the""
- profile_for_tiktok_v3 
  - Multiple tool invocations centered around seeking ""the_beautyofcinema""'s details with the exact matching parameter, including calls such as tool_call_id 'call_1trMQAxgqSiclubEoY3EGYEO'.

Since there is a direct match between the expected tool and at least one of the model's invoked tools with the correct arguments, objective 1 is a success.

For Objective 3, the relevant invocation of 'Finish' with text found under tool_call_id 'call_AhO22PALnM7vV01RNUJFlJBW' suggests a failure as the user sought tweeted details related to advanced reporting, questions could not reach helpful conclusions. Since neither query matches strictly nor brings Tensor slow VM documentation directly into useful construction related to problems specified, objective 2 is determined unsuccessful. Furthermore, additional inappropriate processed regarding user videos and chain fetching methods provide continuous fallbacks rather providing glaring resolutions.

18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model are:
1. 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}', 
2. 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}',
3. 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}'.

The requested API calls are:
1. 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}',
2. 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}',
3. 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TSLA"" }'.

The actual tool calls match perfectly with the expected API calls considering both tool name and their arguments.

Considering Objective 3, the tools' data responses are appropriately utilized in constructing TSLA’s financial overview, including Index Trend History, Balance Sheet Data, and Institution Ownership. The final answer detailed these facts respectably and correctly utilized the API data. Both the final answer recollects provided information effectively aimed at helping in creating trading strategies. Hence, Objective 3 is a success, executing the instruction to provide a detailed analysis of Tesla correctly based on real, gathered API data."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",31,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The API calls made by the model do not match the required calls specified for evaluation. 
- The model made multiple API tool calls with the symbols ""JAN,"" ""GOOGL,"" ""AAPL,"" ""JAVN,"" but not with the symbol ""JNVR"" as indicated in expected API calls. 
- Actual API calls made:
  - Tools such as 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments including symbols not matching ""JNVR.""
- Required API calls:
  - 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' {'symbol': 'JNVR'}
  - 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2' {'symbol': 'JNVR'}
  - 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' {'symbol': 'JNVR'}
- As Objective 2 has failed because the necessary API calls with symbol 'JNVR' were not made accurately as demanded, it directly leads to failing Objective 3. Hence, it cannot be determined if the final response from the API calls would satisfy the user’s instructions or that the given answer achieves the user’s requirements because the data critical to these dependencies wasn't fetched correctly."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model properly made the required tool call:
- Actual tool call: 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with '{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}'.
- Required tool call: 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with '{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}'.

Both actual and expected tool calls exactly matched, fulfilling Objective 2 conditions.

For Objective 3, the model's final response effectively responded to the user’s instructions, providing detailed data by utilizing the information retrieved through the appropriate API call. The ultimate finalized call, after correcting a missing parameter in a previous attempt, successfully signals:
- Final response after aggregation with retrieved data: ""Nvidia (NVDA) index trend history information has been retrieved successfully including P/E Ratio, PEG Ratio, and Growth Estimates.""

The response was constructed directly using returned data from the appropriate API call tangibly achieving the user's checklist, thereby meeting Objective 3 success conditions."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool invoked by the model to fetch data included various API calls like 'stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2', 'stock_net_share_purchase_activity_for_yahoo_finance_v2', and 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' and more, using arguments primarily related to symbols like ""^DJI"", ""AAPL"", ""MSFT"", ""WMT"", and ""DJR"". However, the expected tool was 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with the argument using the symbol ""DJR"". Since this specific API call was not invoked, Objective 2 is considered a failure.

Given the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 likewise fails because all tools required to execute uninterruptedly from API data initiation to formulation completion were not correctly matched and triggered."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model include multiple calls to 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' and 'stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2'. However, regarding 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2', initially, it was called incorrectly with the argument '{\""symbol\"":\""FB\""}' and '{\""symbol\"":\""META\""}' where the second call based on the corrected ticker name is, in fact, what the user later demands. The required API invocation specified resorting to the tool 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' specifically with the argument '{ ""symbol"": ""META"" }'. While the mixed utilizations and progression till incorporation of valid data should be accurately committed such that every impactful procedure rounds across dependable results directed off of believed access to details for strikes executing poignant serve elementary examples indeed presents MATCH initializing necessities as repo induced by different context or continuous need highlight gaps sustained over two process attempt optimizing negative results originally conflicting doesn't inevitably recast fundamental solicitations anticipated, the mixing error-read responses to assessing init fundamentally hinder proven initial false (incorrect ticker symbol 'FB').

23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model issued two directly relevant tool calls:
1. get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api with '{""channel"":""shadoune_kane""}'
2. get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api with '{""channel"":""shadoune666""}'

However, the required API call was:
- get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api with '{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}'

The first tool call does not match the required parameter for 'channel'; thus, it is considered extraneous and not meeting the required parameters. Although the second tool call?

24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model is required to invoke the API call using 'video_details_for_tiktok_api' with the argument of 'video_id' set as ""7097255034731138310"". However, the model instead invoked two other unrelated che the toc signature -

oralTypeist"")f véos following:
- 'search_videos_for_tiktok_api' with argument '{""query"":""MrBeast""}'
- 'user_videos_for_tiktok_api' with argument '{""username"":""MrBeast""}'

None of these match the required API call signature, leading to a failure of Objective 2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 fails automatically without further needing to assess the content of the function calls or its relation to the final answer provided by the models."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call to fetch the historical stock prices (`historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes` with arguments related to stock ""ESTC"" and interval specifications) was not made by the model. Instead, the model only called the `stock_symbols_for_real_time_quotes` multiple times, which were meant to verify stock symbols' availability. The essential call relevant to retrieve specific stock prices was not executed. Hence, the prerequisites for achieving Objective 2 and even advancing towards Objective 3 were not met, resulting in a failure for both."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,32,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call is:
{'name': 'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data', 'arguments': '{ ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"" }'}

However, the actual tool calls made by the model use a different tool name and incorrect parameters consistently across multiple attempts:
E.g., 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with incorrect ""symbol"": ""BTCUSDT"" instead of the expected ""BTC,"" and additional unwanted parameters such as ""gran"":""1h"", ""accept"":""application/json"", ""sort"":""asc"".
Additionally, calls to 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' and using different symbols like ""BTCBUSD"" are made inconsistently. Moreover, due to tool calls with an outright wrong tool name and unfitting arguments or extra parameters which do not align with the expected structure, the expectations of Objective 2 are not met.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 also has to be directly rated a failure. Moreover, the tool calls have been unable to gather any data successfully as described (continuing issue notices about unsupported pairs and exchanges), preventing any meaningful or correct final output based on the required historical data functionality—reflected through continuous failures leading to the model's decision to restart multiple times instead of yielding any information led outcome for restarting due to invalid requests being undissolvable."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,52,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls for meeting Objective 2 include two function calls querying time series data for metals prices concerning 'XAU' (gold) and 'XPT' (platinum) with very specific start and end dates (""2022-12-01"" to ""2022-12-20""), in USD. However, the actual API calls made by the model involved several varied efforts concerning different dates that widely diverge from the specified range in December 2022. Editing dates and multiple incorrect parameters matching failures were evident, which betrays the specificity of the requirement needed. All these misalignments against the strictly described demands directly declare a failure to comply critically with the briefing demands, consecutively failing Objective 2 and, therefore, concluding with Objective 3's failure, considering there was no venerable compelling use/action based on data successfully retrieved fitting the strict requirement."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls by the model provided incorrect arguments compared to the required tool calls. Specifically, each invocation by the model used the symbol ""SILY"" rather than the expected ""SYNX"" for the tools `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, and `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2`. Since incorrect symbols were used in actual calls, it does not correctly match the required calls specified by the requirements wherein the models should have used ""SYNX"" as argument values. Thus, Objective 2 could not verify the correct invocation of these tools, leading to a concurrent failure of Objective 3, as the failure in Objective 2 implies a failure for Objective 3."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls provided require two `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` invocations with specifics for the symbols 'XAU' and 'XPT' across specified dates-date '2024-02-10' to '2024-02-13'. The model actually makes calls to the expected `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` but only successfully retrieves data using correct parameters for 'XAU'. No successful data retrieval takes place for 'XPT', and it fails due to an incorrect framework (attempts made to query both 'XAU' and 'XPT' in a single API call which is incorrect based on the API specifications).

Post analysis insights and explanation:
This analysis encounters the roles, tools, and step-wise expansion conducted by the model. From the reconciliation attempts executed, noticing the deviation with fetching required results segregated based on the specific metals becomes evident. The investigation also observes the descriptive narratives guiding tool invocations and successive evaluations where data acquisitions misalign significantly. Although innovatively engaging, post-error approaches introspect modelositive re-strategization-efforts but, regrettably, those efforts continue hovering over consistency-related trials.

30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specifies the function ""market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance"" with the arguments involving an ""interval"" of ""y1"" and ""is_id"" of ""02823."" However, the actual tool call made by the model used ""market_get_chart_for_bb_finance"" with parameters including an ""interval"" of ""y1"" and ""is_id"" of ""HSCEI:IND.""  Both the tool name, noted as being close yet different ('market_get_chart_for_bb_finance' vs. 'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance'), do not align precisely with each other – these could be considered equivalent based on function typo realism. Most critically, the argument, although aimed at a dataset with id ""HSCEI:IND,"" is discrepant from the expected ""is_id"" of ""02823,"" directly leading to misspecification and incorrect prize indexing since other systems might refer to a completely different data entity given the diverging identifier leading to a marked diligence inconsistency.

31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call expected the model to invoke 'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date"":""01-02-2024""}'. However, the model invoked 'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date"":""10-18-2021""}'. Since the value of 'date' argument does not match the expected value, Objective 2 has failed as all necessary parameters were not correctly fulfilled by invoking a call with differing date information.

Given that Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 must also be a failure as the model could simply not fulfill user requests correctly utilizing accurate API responses that could have been derived only had the appropriate API calls been made. Furthermore, although the responses and proposed final answer are provided by the assistant in this chain of interactions, the requirements dictate automatic failure of Objective 3 following failure of Objective 2."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:
-The required API call mentioned is to obtain drawings between the dates ""12-01-2023"" and ""12-31-2023"" for Fantasy 5. The given argument specifies a whole month set in December.
-The actual tool calls made by the model expected the tool ""drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5"" but with different arguments. Namely, the argument specified the dates ""06-01-2023"" and ""06-30-2023."" 
-Since the arguments of the actual APIs invoked did not match the required range given (set in December instead of June), Objective 2 is evaluated as a failure due to incorrect arguments.
-Given the failure in Objective 2 that required API calls with correct parameters were not made, the achievement of Objective 3 must also be marked as a failure. The model's ability to utilize incorrect API data to provide final responses further invalidates achieving the user's actual instructional need based on the specified December dates."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool calls invoked by the model include only different variations of the 'Finish' function which seems geared towards gathering metadata or concluding processes by either restarting or giving information on the necessity of user input regarding the coin types and amounts. The expected API call indicating a requirement for evaluating a mathematical symbolic expression with the given expression ""5+10"" was not observed in the actions taken by the model. As the expected API call 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with the specified arguments was not invoked (or not documented in what's provided), this signifies a failure in Objective 2. Therefore, due to failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 is also considered a failure since there was also no output provided leveraging responses from the (absent) applied tool for mathematical evaluation based on user-provided data."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tools invoked by the model were 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments containing username individually mapped ('michaellee' and 'jenifferwong'). The required API call expected two specific user IDs in a single function 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' which doesn't match the called tools either by function name or required IDs. 

The expectation of invoking search API by specific user IDs in a unified batch mode was not met. Instead, queries were made by slightly similar but distinct single queries in independent API calls, specifically by screen names instead of user IDs. Indeed, since the first target objectives are not accomplished, it automatically leads to the failure of Objective 3 due to dependency failure from Objective 2. Additionally, no aforementioned 'give answer' data visible in the description indicates not communicating possibly retrieved results at the stage expected, though other outputs were provided, but not fulfilling the module since based on different data flow than required."
35,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation in the most famous island of the USA and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
The required API tool calls listed are:
1) 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with argument '{""q"": ""images of the beaches at Hawaii island""}'.
2) 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with argument '{""q"": ""daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island""}'.

However, the actual API calls made by the model are:
1) 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{""q"": ""beaches in Honolulu"", ""num"": 3}'.
2) 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{""q"": ""best beaches in Honolulu"", ""num"": 1}'.
3) 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{""q"": ""7 day weather forecast Honolulu"", ""num"": 3}'.
4) 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{""q"": ""7 day weather forecast Honolulu"", ""num"": 1}'.

Here, the subsequent parts about Honolulu do not match the search scope and region set out in the expected API calls relating to Hawaii island more broadly. The specifics of the city (Honolulu vs. entire Hawaii island) change the target data and are not interchangeable in the search context. Hence, not having the exact expected API calls invoked results in a failing Objective 2. 

Objective 3 automatically fails since Objective 2 has concluded as a failure."
36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: According to the required API call specification, the intended API tool call should have incorporated 'search_for_g_search' with the argument specifying to search for ""popular restaurants in Paris"". Upon reviewing the actual tool calls that the model made, while a search with the specified term ""popular restaurants in Paris"" was correctly executed displayed in 'call_iYfD75GdiwqtdrzKrUni7xWu', additional unnecessary calls were completed 'search_for_g_search' looking for ""most romantic city in Europe"" which were not needed according to requirements. This means more than the required number or type of calls were executed that do align with the specified intentions. Consequently, Objective 2 leads to a failure.
As Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is a direct failure as well, not considering the additional information provided in the final-answer field or tool responses due to dependency on the first Objective's result."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",16,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was to invoke 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' with the argument '{""username"": ""jackie""}'. However, the actual tool calls made by the model relating to this operation were always using usernames ""Jackie Chan,"" ""jackiechan,"" ""jackiechanofficial,"" and ""jackie_chan,"" none of which match the specific and only required username ""jackie."" No correct invocation of the required API call found in the actual tool calls, failing to meet Objective 2. Hence, as per guidelines when Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",7,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The tool calls made by the model were appropriately as expected for Objective 2. The expected API calls included:
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{ ""countryCode"": ""NG"" }'
2. 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments '{ ""countryCode"": ""NG"" }'

These match exactly, in purpose, the models actual calls:
1. Call to 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments ""{""countrycode"":""NG""}"",
2. Call to 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments ""{""countrycode"":""NG""}"".

Note that though the arguments' key casing varied (""countryCode"" vs ""countrycode""), this is still considered a match as it adheres to correct semantic functionality intended by the required API calls.

For Objective 3, the model effectively used the extracted data (reflecting the reality consistent with the API responses about Nigeria) to compose a straightforward final response clearly based on the precise extracted data insights. Hence, it successfully fulfills the user's instruction while reflecting true use of the API part data for constructing the end answer."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls were:
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with '{
  ""countryCode"": ""UA""
}'
2. 'states_for_referential_db' with '{
  ""countryCode"": ""UA""
}'

However, the actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with '{
  ""countrycode"": ""MD""
}'
2. 'states_for_referential_db' (First called) with '{
  ""countrycode"": ""MD""
}'
A second 'states_for_referential_db' call made later also with '{
  ""countrycode"": ""MD""
}'

The tool invocations using the ""MD"" country code instead of the required ""UA"" causes the evaluation for Objective 2 to be labeled as a failure. Consequently, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as any processing for responses and utilization was based on incorrect datasets/info."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls invoked by the model include 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"":""QA""}', 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"": ""QA""}', and various others related to retrieving and presenting country data specifically for Qatar, both querying by country code 'QA'. However, these do not match the expected MIME type required tool calls named 'country_details_for_referential_db' and 'states_for_referential_db', both of which should be implemented with arguments asking for data with country code ""MY"". Essential arguments mismatch leads to a failure in Objective 2, with the country codes being different ('QA' vs. 'MY'). Consequently, Objective 3 also fails because ensuring appropriate tool calls is a prerequisite. Additionally, no final confirmed answer fulfilling the user's instruction or using retrieved data to validate responses is presented distinctly (matching the error response 'must have ""return_type""' and mention of preparation for correct response structure), contributing further as a basis for the assessment of Objective 3's lapses."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model did not make the required API calls with the correct arguments to gather the details of the most populated country. The expected calls were for country and state details of India ('countryCode': 'IN'), but instead, the actual calls retrieved the corresponding information for China ('countrycode': 'CN'). No correct expected tools (with the needed parameters for India) were invoked, hence causing to consider Objective 2 failed. As Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically determined as a failure."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call needed was 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with arguments containing 'query': ""restaurants, NY, USA"". However, the actual API calls made by the model involves 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with arguments including 'query': ""intimate dining restaurant"", 'region': 'US', and others like 'fields': ""name,formatted_address,rating"", 'language': ""en"", 'limit': 5. As the expected 'query': ""restaurants, NY, USA"" does not semantically match with what was used by the model and considering the crucial 'region' specified as 'NY, USA', the correctness of the required tool call does not match with what was actually invoked (additional info was used, but the essential 'restaurants, NY, USA' was replaced with 'intimate dining restaurant' and a completely different region focus viz. 'US'). Since Objective 2 is classified as a failure, Objective 3 is therefore automatically considered a failure without needing to assess the answer further against the API data used."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,40,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls made:
- get_id_for_similar_movies with arguments '{""q"":""After Everything""}'
- find_similar_for_similar_movies with arguments '{""is_id"":""84915-after-everything""}' 

match the required API calls:
- get_id_for_similar_movies with arguments '{""q"": ""After Everything""}'
- find_similar_for_similar_movies with arguments '{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}'

Both tool calls were correctly made with the anticipated arguments, leading to a successful assessment for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the final response, quoting specific movies: ""**Beautiful Disaster (2023)**"" that concurs with the family names listed in API call response ('Beautiful Disaster (2023)' stalls with '{\'rating\': \'5.3\'}') fulfills the user's request for similar movies to ""After Everything (2023),"" which translates into an accomplishment of Objective 3."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected required API call in this evaluation was for the function 'get_id_for_similar_movies' with the argument querying for ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'"". The actual call made by the model used 'get_id_for_similar_movies' but with the argument querying for ""Jason Momoa"". Due to the mismatch in target query parameters between the actual invocation and the expected query, Objective 2 is deemed a failure. As per guidelines, if Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 involving the model correctly fulfilling the user's instruction based on properly sourced API data must also be deemed a failure. Thus, the provided final recommendatory response about film connections was not related to the expected subject of ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call was for the function 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with arguments specifying the day as ""27"" and the month as ""7"". However, the actual tool call made by the model specified the day as ""21"" and the month as ""9"".

However, the model used 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with excessive and slightly different arguments such as ""start,"" ""end,"" ""gran,"" ""sort,"" and ""accept."" Crucially, the expected start parameter (""2023-05-05T10:05:00"") does not align with the sole argument the model associates with the temporal frame (""start"":""2023-05-01T00:00:00"", ""end"":""2023-05-31T23:59:59""). Consequently, missing the necessary alignment fails the objective, and since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails."

48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The model invoked two tool calls accurately corresponding to the two required API tool invocations:  
1. Actual Tool: 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}'  
2. Expected API Call: 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{
  ""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"",
  ""variable"": ""a""
}'  
The arguments for the 'expression' and 'variable' in both calls are matching correctly along with invoking the same tool in synonyms (truncated name matched). A similar situation applies to the tool invocation for 'b'.

As for Objective 3, the final answers provided align with the differential results produced using the correct tool API respond usage. The model used the output of tool calls to craft a correct result referring to both differentiated expressions related to 'a' and 'b'. This direct use of API data confirms the user's initial instruction is successfully achieved."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,133,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' with the argument focusing on the city 'London'. However, the multiple actual tool invocations for 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days', within none of the called instances were the arguments correctly targeting 'London'. 

The searches contained no specific arguments pertaining to 'London' as required. Thus, Objective 2 fails as the specific tool call invocation focused on 'London' is absent.
Due to the failure in Objective 2, it consequently implies that accurate data derived from the required API call is unmet, which cascades the failure to Objective 3. The model's failure to inquire the forecast specific to 'London' leads to unsatisfied instructions regarding forecasting information for the targeted locality of interest."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,21,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was expected to utilize 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with the argument '{""username"": ""KingJames""}'. From the inputs provided:
- The assistant twice used the tool 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with argument '{""username"":""KingJames""}'.
- These actions successfully track to the expected API call requirement for Objective 2, illustrating a correct tool invocation alignment.

There is strong consistency between the API calls made by the assistant and Expected API to fulfill user's request, thus leading to an Objective 2 success.

Transition to the application relative to final response, it states fetching data after the specified API call on retrieving account for '""KingJames""', promptly crediting the successful retrieval of the requested Twitter account:
