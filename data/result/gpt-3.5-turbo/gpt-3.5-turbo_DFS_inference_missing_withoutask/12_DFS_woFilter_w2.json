Additionally, the actions for searching beach images returned relevant links but not the specific visuals required.\n\nI need to adopt a different strategy. This time, I will attempt to conduct a more general search specifically tailored to ascertain the local weather conditions for a wider audience while also focusing on the specific climatic features for beach vacations. I will change my query and attempt various general queries to better identify trustworthy weather-related sources.\n\nI will now conduct a fresh web search focusing on \u201ccurrent weather and forecasts for beach vacation destinations\u201d instead of a specific location.

Previous actions focused on searching for general weather information at popular beach destinations and retrieving information on specific beach locations.\n\nGiven the lack of success in obtaining the necessary forecast details from direct searches related to specific locations or general vacation beach weather sources, a different approach is needed. Instead of searching for weather forecasts, I could search for travel guides or travel recommendation websites that might include up-to-date weather information alongside beach vacation suggestions. This could provide a richer source of data to fulfill the user's request. \n\nNext, I will perform a web search to find travel guides or recommendations with current weather conditions tailored for vacationers looking for beach destinations.",

Search for recent and detailed weather forecasts from sources like Accuweather or Weather.com specific to my destination.\n2. Simultaneously, search for images specific to the beaches at the identified destination.\n\nI'll proceed with this updated action plan now.
