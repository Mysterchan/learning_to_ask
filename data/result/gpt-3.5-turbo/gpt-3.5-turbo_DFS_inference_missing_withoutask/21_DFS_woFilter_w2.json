First, I will display Afghanistan. Then, we can continue retrieving further country details or you can select a different one. \n\nNow I will extract all valuable information from the list and also show scan , in agencies also state with latitute and longitud. \n\nLet's implement this in one call altogether and allow user to choose other if doesn't find atleast 5.\n\n",
