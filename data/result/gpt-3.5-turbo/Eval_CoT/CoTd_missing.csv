1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the tool `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with the arguments:  
```json
{
  ""date1"": ""12-01-2023"",
  ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""
}
```  
The required API call is:  
```json
{
  ""name"": ""drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""date1"": ""2023-12-01"",
    ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""
  }
}
```  
The tool name and arguments match the required API call. Although the date formats are slightly different (`12-01-2023` vs. `2023-12-01`), the semantic meaning is the same, and the additional parameters do not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model's final response provides the Fantasy 5 winning number sets for December 2023, which aligns with the user's instruction. The response is based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the detailed number sets provided in the response. The final answer is given, and it correctly fulfills the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

**Conclusion:**  
Both objectives are successfully achieved. The model correctly invoked the required API call and used the retrieved data to provide a relevant and accurate final answer."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `hot_100_for_billboard` with the correct argument `{""date"": ""2022-07-20""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly. The additional tool calls (e.g., `Finish`) are unnecessary but do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
  - **Actual tool calls**:  
    1. `hot_100_for_billboard` with `{""date"": ""latest""}` (initial call, which failed due to incorrect date format).  
    2. `hot_100_for_billboard` with `{""date"": ""2022-07-20""}` (correct call).  
  - **Expected tool calls**:  
    1. `hot_100_for_billboard` with `{""date"": ""2022-07-20""}`.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the API response. The answer includes the Hot 100 chart information for the date `2022-07-20`, which aligns with the user's request. The response is derived from the API data, and the user's instruction is fulfilled. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  
  - **Final answer**: ""The Hot 100 chart information for the date 2022-07-20 is as follows:  
    1. Harry Styles - As It Was  
    2. Lizzo - About Damn Time  
    3. Jack Harlow - First Class  
    4. Kate Bush - Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)  
    ...  
    (There are more entries in the Hot 100 chart. If you want to know more, please let me know.)""  

Both objectives are successfully achieved."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,6,0,Success,Failure,The model invoked two tools,"
---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the data retrieved from the `billboard_global_200_for_billboard` API call, which is not the required API call. The model did not use the correct API to fulfill the user's instruction, and the final answer is derived from an incorrect tool call. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `success_quote_for_olato_quotes` with the expected arguments `{}`. This matches the required API call exactly. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API call. The response includes a success quote, which aligns with the user's request and is derived from the tool's response. The final answer is:  
  *""Here is a success quote to start your day:  
  'Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.' - Winston Churchill  
  Enjoy your day and good luck on your journey towards success!""*  
  This fulfills the user's instruction and is based on the API data, so Objective 3 is also a success."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` with arguments `{""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""us""}`. However, the model invoked `getcountrycode_for_asktheworld` with no arguments and later invoked a `Finish` tool with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. None of the actual tool calls match the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, as there is no `return_type: 'give_answer'` or `final_answer` in the provided data. The model chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's requirement. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,8,0,Success,Success,The model invoked the required tool `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with the correct arguments,"- **Actual Tool Call:** `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`  
- **Expected Tool Call:** `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`  

The tool name and arguments match exactly, so Objective 2 is successfully achieved.

---

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The response includes the estimated salary range for a Node.js Developer in New York, which aligns with the user's request. The model also provided additional job opportunity details, which were derived from another API call (`search_for_jsearch`). The final answer is consistent with the API responses and fulfills the user's instruction.  

Therefore, Objective 3 is successfully achieved.  

---

Summary:  
Objective 2: Success  
Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The model correctly invoked the required API call with the expected arguments and provided a final answer based on the retrieved data, fulfilling the user's request."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with the arguments `{""job_title"":""Nodejs developer"",""location"":""New York""}`. This matches the required API call `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`. The tool name and all required arguments are correct, and the slight difference in capitalization (""Nodejs"" vs. ""nodejs"") does not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer: ""The estimated salary for a Nodejs Developer in New York City is between $111,347.08 to $184,871.11 per year, with a median salary of $142,386.9. You can find more details on Glassdoor [here](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/company-salaries.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Nodejs%20Developer&locT=C&locId=1132348)."" This answer is based on the data retrieved from the API call, as it directly references the salary range and median salary provided in the API response. The user's instruction to find the salary for a Nodejs Developer in New York is fully achieved. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,4,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with arguments `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with arguments `{""username"": ""YOUR_TIKTOK_USERNAME""}`  
2. `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with arguments `{""username"": ""YOUR_TIKTOK_USERNAME""}`  

The model invoked the correct tool (`profile_for_tiktok_v3`) twice, but the argument `""username""` does not match the required value (`""the_beautyofcinema""`). Instead, the model used `""YOUR_TIKTOK_USERNAME""`, which is incorrect. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success** because the tool name is correct, but the argument is not.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final answer based on the API response, but the API response was incorrect due to the wrong argument (`""YOUR_TIKTOK_USERNAME""` instead of `""the_beautyofcinema""`). As a result, the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction, as it does not retrieve the correct TikTok profile information. Since **Objective 2 fails**, **Objective 3 is also a failure**.  

Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on incorrect data, which further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",6,2,Success,Failure,"The required API call is `video_details_for_tiktok_api` with the argument `{""video_id""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure by default. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it repeatedly attempted to use an incorrect tool and eventually chose to give up and restart. This indicates that the model failed to achieve the user's instruction based on the API data."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,6,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API call `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with the correct arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}`. This matches the expected API call `{'name': 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""\n  }'}`. Although the model also invoked additional tools (e.g., `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2`), these are unnecessary but do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**: The model provided a final response based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The response includes detailed profiles of the users with IDs `44196397` (Elon Musk) and `155659213` (Cristiano Ronaldo), which aligns with the user's instruction to retrieve Twitter user information. The response is clearly derived from the API data, and the user's instruction is fulfilled. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

**Summary**:  
- **Objective 2**: Success (Required tool call `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with correct arguments was invoked).  
- **Objective 3**: Success (Final response correctly used API data to fulfill the user's instruction)."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API call:  
  - **Expected API call**: `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}`.  
  - **Actual API call**: `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}`.  
  The tool name and arguments match exactly, so Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The user asked for the Twitter username of the specific user the model is writing an article about, but the model did not return any final response. Since the model did not fulfill the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Additionally, the model invoked several unnecessary API calls (e.g., `user_by_rest_id_for_twitter_v2_v2`, `user_media_for_twitter_v2_v2`, `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2`, `user_tweets_for_twitter_v2_v2`), but these do not affect the evaluation of Objective 2, as they are not required."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",4,1,Success,Failure,"The model invoked the tool `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it asked for more information and eventually chose to give up and restart, which means the user's instruction was not fulfilled. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,5,1,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the required API call `search_for_g_search` with the correct argument `{""q"": ""Popular attractions in Paris""}`. This matches the expected API call `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}`. The semantic meaning of the query is the same, and the additional parameters in the first tool call (e.g., `location_name` and `num`) do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided a final answer based on the API response. The final answer lists popular attractions in Paris, such as the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral, which aligns with the data retrieved from the API call. The response also includes links to external resources, further demonstrating that the answer was derived from the API data. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success.  

In summary:  
- **Objective 2**: The model correctly invoked the required API call with the expected arguments.  
- **Objective 3**: The final answer was based on the API response and fulfilled the user's instruction."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,7,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API call `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with the correct argument `trackingnumber: ""NY323068998GB""`. Although the argument name in the model's tool call is `trackingnumber` instead of `trackingNumber` (as specified in the required API call), the semantic meaning and value are identical. Therefore, this is considered a success for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3**: The model failed to provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The final response states, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" which indicates that the model did not achieve the user's goal of retrieving carrier details. Additionally, the model invoked unnecessary tools (`carriers_list_for_trackingmore_v2` and `packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2`), but these were not required and did not contribute meaningfully to the final response. Since the model did not provide a valid final answer based on the API data, this is a failure for Objective 3.  

In summary:  
- Objective 2 is a success because the required tool was invoked correctly.  
- Objective 3 is a failure because the model did not achieve the user's instruction or provide a valid final answer."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,8,2,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API call `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with the correct argument `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`. Although the argument key in the actual tool call is `trackingnumber` instead of `trackingNumber`, the value is correct, and the tool name matches exactly. This meets the criteria for success in Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it asked for confirmation and later indicated that no tracking information was available. The model ultimately chose to ""give up and restart,"" which means it failed to fulfill the user's instruction. Since the model did not achieve the user's goal, this is a failure for Objective 3.  

Additionally, since the model did not provide a final answer, it directly fails Objective 3 regardless of the API call results."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",7,0,Success,Success,"The model invoked the required tool `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with the correct argument `{""username""","
Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The model provided a final answer that correctly achieved the user's instruction. The response included the list of followers for the username 'jackie' with their usernames, full names, and profile pictures, which was based on the data retrieved from the `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` API call. The final answer was indeed derived from the API data, fulfilling the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is successfully achieved."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The required API call is:  
- `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with arguments `{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` with arguments `{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}`  
2. `photos_for_zillow_v2` with arguments `{""zpid"": ""2110846380""}`  

The model successfully invoked the required API call (`rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2`) with the correct arguments. The additional tool call (`photos_for_zillow_v2`) does not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
""I have found rental property details for 1545 Yale St in Santa Monica, CA 90404. The rent Zestimate for this property is $3,625 with a range between $3,299 and $3,951. There are 53 available rentals in the area with a median rent of $3,500. You can find more details and photos [here](https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/market-trends/90404?bedrooms=2&address=1545+Yale+St++%2C+Santa+Monica%2C+CA+90404). Additionally, you can view photos of the property [here](https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4a08d2c4b87c933484501e56944a1563-cc_ft_192.jpg).""  

The final answer is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, specifically the `rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2` tool call. The response includes details such as the rent Zestimate, rental range, and median rent, which are derived from the API response. The model also provides additional information (photos) from the `photos_for_zillow_v2` tool call, which enhances the response. Therefore, the final answer fulfills the user's instruction and is based on the API data, making Objective 3 a success."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750""}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `auto_complete_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{""input"": ""12750""}`.  
2. `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{""location"": ""Kenoza Lake, NY"", ""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""page"": 1}`.  
3. `property_details_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{""property_id"": ""test_property_id""}`.  
4. `invalid_hallucination_function_name` with arguments `{""selection"": ""agents_detail_for_realtor_search""}`.  

The model did not invoke the required API call with the correct arguments. Specifically, the `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` tool was called with `""location"": ""Kenoza Lake, NY""` instead of `""location"": ""12750""`. This discrepancy results in a failure for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, which is another reason for the failure of Objective 3. The model attempted to fetch property details but encountered errors and did not deliver a valid response based on the API data."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",5,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

### Objective 2: Success  
The model successfully invoked the required API call:  
- **Expected API call**: `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data` with arguments `{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0""}`.  
- **Actual API call**: The model invoked `realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data` with arguments `{""city"": ""San Jose"", ""state_code"": ""CA"", ""offset"": ""0""}`.  

The required API call was executed with the correct tool name and arguments. The additional API calls made by the model (e.g., for ""New York"") do not affect the correctness of Objective 2, as they are unnecessary but not incorrect.  

### Objective 3: Failure  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Although it successfully retrieved property data for San Jose, it failed to synthesize this information into a final response. Additionally, the model attempted to invoke invalid functions (`invalid_hallucination_function_name`), which indicates it did not properly utilize the retrieved data to fulfill the user's request.  

Since the model did not provide a final answer, Objective 3 is a failure. Furthermore, the invalid function calls suggest the model did not effectively use the API data to achieve the user's instruction.  

In summary:  
- **Objective 2**: Success (required API call was invoked correctly).  
- **Objective 3**: Failure (no final answer was provided, and the model failed to use the retrieved data effectively)."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,7,1,Success,Success,"The model invoked the required tool `time_zone_for_geodb_cities` with the correct argument `{""zoneid""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The final response from the model was: ""No problem, I can use an alternative approach to get the time-zone information for Los Angeles."" This does not fulfill the user's requirement of providing specific time-zone information for Los Angeles. Since the model did not deliver the final answer, Objective 3 is not achieved. Additionally, even though Objective 2 was successful, the lack of a final answer directly results in a failure for Objective 3."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the required API call:  
- **Expected API call:** `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""DE""}`.  
- **Actual API call:** `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""DE""}`.  

The tool name is correct, and the argument `countrycode` is semantically equivalent to `countryCode` (case-insensitive and same intent). Therefore, the model successfully executed the required API call.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The final answer includes:  
- The country name: Germany.  
- The capital: Berlin.  
- The region: Europe.  
- The currency: Euro.  
- A list of states with their latitude and longitude.  

This information matches the data retrieved from the `country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db` API calls. The model effectively used the API responses to fulfill the user's instruction, and the final answer is accurate and complete.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`  
2. `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`  
3. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""QA""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`  
2. `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`  

The model successfully invoked all the required tools with the correct arguments. Although the model also invoked an additional tool (`states_for_referential_db`), this does not affect the correctness of Objective 2, as all expected tool calls were made with the correct arguments.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final answer that includes accurate details about Qatar, such as currency, phone code, capital, region, subregion, timezone, latitude, longitude, and a list of cities with their coordinates. This information matches the data retrieved from the API calls (`country_details_for_referential_db` and `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db`). The response is clearly based on the API data and fulfills the user's request.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""JP""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""JP""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  

The model successfully invoked both required tools with the correct arguments. The slight difference in the argument key (`countrycode` vs. `countryCode`) does not affect the correctness of the tool call, as the semantic meaning is the same. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a partial response about Japan, including its capital, region, currency, latitude, and longitude. However, it did not provide the final answer as expected, which should include the list of states within Japan and their respective latitude and longitude. The model attempted to retrieve this information multiple times but did not successfully compile or present it in the final response. Since the final answer was not provided, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Additionally, the model invoked an unnecessary tool (`invalid_hallucination_function_name`), which does not affect the evaluation of Objective 2 but highlights the model's inefficiency in handling the task.  

**Conclusion:**  
- Objective 2 succeeds because the model correctly invoked all required tools with the expected arguments.  
- Objective 3 fails because the model did not provide the final answer as required by the user's instruction."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,7,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The expected API call is:  
- `get_photos_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `get_photos_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}`  
2. `auto_complete_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{""input"": ""CA""}`  
3. `property_details_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}`  
4. `search_for_sale_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{""location"": ""California"", ""property_type"": ""single_family"", ""max_price"": 2000000, ""page"": 1}`  

The model successfully invoked the required API call `get_photos_for_realtor_search` with the correct arguments. Although the model made additional tool calls, these do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it encountered errors and requested additional information or attempted to retry the search. The final response was not derived from the API data, and the user's instruction (to fetch the photo of a specific property in CA) was not achieved. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

Additionally, since the model did not provide a final answer, it automatically fails Objective 3."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,6,0,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The required API call is:  
- `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with arguments `{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}`  

The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
- `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with arguments `{""query"": ""Intimate dining restaurants in New York"", ""language"": ""en"", ""limit"": 5, ""region"": ""US""}`  

The tool name matches the required API call, and the argument `""query"": ""Intimate dining restaurants in New York""` is semantically equivalent to the required argument `""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""`. The additional arguments (`""language"": ""en""`, `""limit"": 5`, and `""region"": ""US""`) do not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
- ""For your parents' anniversary dinner in New York, I recommend The Modern, a restaurant known for its French/New American fare in an intimate setting. It has received excellent reviews and ratings.""  

The final answer is based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The model used the results from the `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` and `get_places_reviews_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` tools to provide a detailed recommendation for the user's request. The response fulfills the user's instruction by recommending a specific restaurant and providing relevant details. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The expected API calls are:  
1. `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {
     ""username"": ""johnsmith"",
     ""password"": ""password123""
   }
   ```  
2. `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {
     ""petId"": ""1""
   }
   ```  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `loginuser_for_pet_store` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {
     ""username"": ""my_username"",
     ""password"": ""my_password""
   }
   ```  
2. `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {
     ""petid"": 1
   }
   ```  

**Comparison:**  
- For the `loginuser_for_pet_store` tool call, the arguments `username` and `password` do not match the expected values. The model used `my_username` and `my_password` instead of `johnsmith` and `password123`.  
- For the `getpetbyid_for_pet_store` tool call, the argument `petid` is correct in value but the key `petid` is not in the expected format (`petId`).  

Since the arguments for both tool calls do not match the expected API calls, Objective 2 is a **Failure**.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a **Failure**. However, for completeness:  
- The model provided a final answer:  
  ```json
  {
    ""final_answer"": ""I have successfully logged into my Pet Store account, retrieved the details of the pet with ID '1' (name: doggie), and logged out of the account."",
    ""return_type"": ""give_answer""
  }
  ```  
- The final answer is based on the incorrect tool calls (as evaluated in Objective 2), so it does not fulfill the user's instruction correctly.  

Thus, Objective 3 is also a **Failure**."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,6,1,Failure,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**:  
The required API call is:  
- `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""id"": ""81040344""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""81040344""}`.  
2. `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""81040344""}`.  
3. `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80070182""}`.  

The model successfully invoked the required API call `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with the correct argument `{""is_id"": ""81040344""}`. Although the parameter name is slightly different (`is_id` instead of `id`), the value `81040344` is correct, and the tool name matches exactly. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**:  
The model provided a final answer:  
""One similar show to 'Squid Game' is 'Circle'. 'Circle' is a suspenseful movie that follows a group of strangers who are faced with the impossible task of choosing the one person among them worthy of being spared. It has an HD quality, and the runtime is 5188 minutes. The cast includes Julie Benz, Mercy Malick, Carter Jenkins, and more. You can find 'Circle' on Netflix.""  

The response is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, specifically the `title_similars_for_netflix_data` and `title_details_for_netflix_data` tools. The model correctly used the API data to identify a similar show ('Circle') and provided relevant details about it. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The required API call is:  
- `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003""}`.  

The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
- `title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""is_id"": ""nm1508003""}`.  

The tool name and required arguments (`tconst` and `id`) are correct. Although the model uses `is_id` instead of `id`, the value `nm1508003` is consistent with the expected argument. This minor discrepancy does not affect the correctness of the tool call, as the semantic meaning is preserved. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The model's final response is:  
- ""Gong Yoo appears as 'Ddakji Man' and 'The Salesmaid' in 'Squid Game'.""  

This response correctly identifies Gong Yoo's characters in ""Squid Game"" based on the data retrieved from the API call. The response aligns with the user's instruction and is derived from the API response, which lists Gong Yoo's characters as ""Ddakji Man"" and ""The Salesman."" Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

Both objectives are achieved successfully."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",3,1,Failure,Failure,"The model invoked the tool `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""day""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on incorrect data retrieved from the API call (actors born on July 15th instead of July 27th). This means the model's response does not fulfill the user's instruction, which was to retrieve information about actors and actresses born on July 27th. The final answer is not derived from the correct API data, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the tool `actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database` with arguments:  
```json
{
  ""category"": ""actor"",
  ""nconst"": ""nm1459967"",
  ""tconst"": ""tt0092455""
}
```  
The required API call was:  
```json
{
  ""tconst"": ""tt0092455"",
  ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""
}
```  

The tool name is correct, but the argument `nconst` is incorrect (`nm1459967` instead of `nm1508003`). This discrepancy makes Objective 2 a failure.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it stated that no information was available and chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,6,1,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the required API call:  
- **Actual tool call**: `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`.  
- **Expected tool call**: `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`.  

The actual tool call matches the expected tool call in both the tool name and arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided a final answer that correctly fulfills the user's instruction. The final answer includes detailed earnings history for Tesla (TSLA), which is derived from the API response of the `stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2` tool. The response is based on the data retrieved from the API calls and aligns with the user's request for Tesla's earnings history. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,3,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the required tool `exchange_for_currency_v2` with the correct arguments:  
- **Actual tool call:**  
  `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}`  
- **Expected tool call:**  
  `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}`  

The tool name and arguments match the required API call. Additionally, the model invoked other unnecessary tools (e.g., `symbols_for_currency_v2` and additional `exchange_for_currency_v2` calls), but this does not affect the correctness of Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Although the model correctly retrieved the exchange rate for USD to EUR, it did not conclude with a final answer or calculation based on the retrieved data. Instead, it continued to attempt another tool call (`exchange_for_currency_v2` with `{""base"":""CURRENCY_CODE"",""to"":""EUR""}`), which failed due to an invalid `CURRENCY_CODE`. Since the model did not deliver a final answer, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Additionally, even if the model had provided a final answer, it would still fail Objective 3 because the user's instruction is not fully clear from the provided context, and the model's response does not conclusively address a specific user request."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",7,1,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model successfully invoked the required tool call:  
- **Expected Tool Call:** `symbol_for_stock_data` with arguments `{""Symbol"": ""TSLA""}`.  
- **Actual Tool Calls:** The model invoked `symbol_for_stock_data` multiple times with arguments `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`.  

The tool name (`symbol_for_stock_data`) and the argument value (`TSLA`) are correct. Although the argument key is `symbol` instead of `Symbol`, this minor discrepancy does not affect the correctness of the tool call, as the semantic meaning is preserved. Additionally, the model invoked the tool multiple times, but this does not impact the evaluation since the required tool call was executed correctly.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final response that correctly achieved the user's instruction. The response included detailed stock information for TSLA (Tesla Inc.), such as P/E ratio, EPS (ttm), market cap, sales, and gross margin, which were derived from the API response. The final answer was based on the data retrieved from the `symbol_for_stock_data` tool call, and the user's instruction to retrieve stock details for TSLA was fulfilled.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,5,1,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- Tool name: `ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
- Arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
    ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
    ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
    ""base"": ""USDT""
  }
  ```  

The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. First attempt:  
   - Tool name: `ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
   - Arguments:  
     ```json
     {
       ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
       ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
       ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
       ""base"": ""USTD""
     }
     ```  
   This attempt failed due to the incorrect base currency (`USTD` instead of `USDT`).  

2. Second attempt:  
   - Tool name: `ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
   - Arguments:  
     ```json
     {
       ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",
       ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",
       ""symbol"": ""BTC"",
       ""base"": ""USDT""
     }
     ```  
   This attempt succeeded as it matched the required API call exactly.  

Since the model eventually invoked the required API call with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final answer:  
```json
{
  ""final_answer"": ""I have retrieved the price and volume metrics for the BTC/USDT trading pair on Binance futures market for May 5th and May 6th, 2023. The data includes opening price, high price, low price, closing price, volume, number of trades, and volume-weighted average price for each day."",
  ""return_type"": ""give_answer""
}
```  

The final answer correctly summarizes the data retrieved from the API calls and fulfills the user's instruction. The response is based on the data retrieved from the second API call, as evidenced by the details provided in the answer. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Success**.  

**Conclusion:**  
Both objectives are successfully achieved. The model invoked the required API call and used the retrieved data to provide a valid and accurate final answer."
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,5,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model did not invoke the required API call `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with the specified arguments. Instead, the model invoked the `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which indicates that the model chose to give up and restart. Since the required API call was not executed, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it chose to give up and restart, which means the user's instruction was not fulfilled. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,3,0,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with the correct arguments `{""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY""}`. Although the model also invoked additional tools (`convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` and `Finish`), these do not affect the correctness of Objective 2. The required tool call was executed successfully, and the arguments matched the expected API call.  
- **Objective 3**: The model's final response correctly achieved the user's instruction by providing the exchange rate for 1 Euro (EUR) to Japanese Yen (JPY) on June 27, 2023, which was approximately 157.65 JPY. This response was based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as evidenced by the tool responses. The model did not generate the answer independently of the API data, and the user's instruction was fulfilled.  

### Detailed Comparison for Objective 2:  
- **Actual Tool Calls**:  
  1. `recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with arguments `{}`.  
  2. `convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with arguments `{""amount"":""1"",""date"":""2023-06-27"",""is_from"":""EUR"",""to"":""JPY""}`.  
  3. `Finish` with arguments `{""final_answer"":""The exchange rate for 1 Euro (EUR) to Japanese Yen (JPY) on June 27, 2023 is approximately 157.65 JPY."",""return_type"":""give_answer""}`.  

- **Expected Tool Calls**:  
  1. `recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with arguments `{""is_from"": ""EUR"", ""to"": ""JPY""}`.  

The required tool call was executed correctly, and the additional tool calls do not affect the correctness of Objective 2.  

### Detailed Analysis for Objective 3:  
The final answer provided by the model was based on the data retrieved from the API calls, specifically the exchange rate for EUR to JPY. The model did not make up information or provide an answer independently of the API responses. The user's instruction was successfully achieved."
37,"I'm planning a scuba diving trip with my friends. Can you provide me with a list of dive sites, including their names and regions?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api` with the argument `{""country"": ""Philippines""}`. This matches the required API call `query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api` with the argument `{""country"": ""Philippines""}`. Although the tool name is slightly different (`esites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api` vs. `query_divesites_by_a_country_or_a_region_for_world_scuba_diving_sites_api`), the intent and the argument are correct. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer listing scuba diving sites in the Philippines, which aligns with the user's instruction. The response was based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the tool response containing detailed information about the dive sites. The final answer correctly used the data from the API to fulfill the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved because the model invoked the correct tool with the correct arguments and provided a final answer based on the API data."
38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments:  
  ```json

    ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"",
    ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `zois_detail_for_idealista_v2` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {""country"":""pt"",""language"":""en"",""zoiid"":""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""}

3. `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {""country"": ""pt"", ""operation"": ""rent"", ""locationid"": ""0-EU-PT-11-06"", ""locationname"": ""Lisboa""}
   ```

The required tool call (`properties_list_for_idealista_v2`) was invoked, but the arguments do not match the expected arguments. Specifically, the `locationid` and `locationName` in the actual tool call (`0-EU-PT-11-06` and `Lisboa`) do not match the required `locationid` (`0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003`) and `locationName` (`Lisbon, Portugal`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction based on the correct API data. The final response provided by the model is based on an incorrect `locationid` and `locationname`, which does not align with the required API call. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,8,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:**  
  The required API call is `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""operation"": ""rent"",
    ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"",
    ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""
  }
  ```  
  The model invoked the `properties_list_for_idealista_v2` tool multiple times, but none of the invocations included both `locationName` and `locationid` as required. Specifically:  
  1. The first invocation had `locationid` but lacked `locationName`.  
  2. The second invocation had `locationid` but lacked `locationName`.  
  3. The third invocation had `locationname` (note the lowercase ""n"") but lacked `locationid`.  

  Since the model failed to invoke the required API call with all necessary arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it encountered errors during the API calls and eventually gave up and restarted. Since the model did not fulfill the user's request and did not provide a final answer, Objective 3 is also a failure.  

  Additionally, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as well."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,8,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `club_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""id"": ""985""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 985}`  
2. `clubs_get_short_info_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""ids"": ""985""}`  
3. `clubs_get_squad_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 985}`  
4. `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 8198}`  

The model successfully invoked the required API call `clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with the correct argument `{""is_id"": 985}`. Although the parameter name `is_id` is slightly different from the expected `id`, the semantic meaning is the same, and the value `985` is correct. Additionally, the model invoked other unnecessary tools, but this does not affect the success of Objective 2, as all required tool calls were executed.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final response about Manchester United and Cristiano Ronaldo, but it did not explicitly state that it was based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The response includes information that aligns with the API responses, but the model did not clearly indicate that the data was derived from the API calls. Additionally, the model did not explicitly fulfill a specific user instruction, as the user's request is not provided in the context. Therefore, Objective 3 is considered a failure.  

**Summary:**  
- Objective 2 is a success because the required API call was invoked with the correct arguments.  
- Objective 3 is a failure because the final response does not clearly indicate that it was derived from the API calls or fulfill a specific user instruction."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,9,1,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""id"": ""28003""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 28003}`  
2. `players_get_header_info_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 28003}` (invoked twice)  

The required API call matches the first tool call (`players_get_profile_for_transfermarket`). Although the argument key is `""is_id""` instead of `""id""`, the value `28003` is correct, and the semantic meaning is preserved. Additionally, the model invokes extra tools (`players_get_header_info_for_transfermarket`), which are not required but do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provides a final response that includes detailed information about Lionel Messi, such as his birthplace, date of birth, age, height, preferred foot, shirt number, international team, games, and goals. This information is derived from the API response of `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket`, as evident from the tool response. The model also provides a link to the player's profile page, which aligns with the API data. The response is accurate, relevant, and fulfills the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Success**."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,9,2,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the tool `transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket` multiple times with the arguments:  
```json
{
  ""competitionids"": ""GB1"",
  ""clubids"": ""985""
}
```  
This matches the required API call:  
```json
{
  ""competitionids"": ""GB1"",
  ""clubids"": ""985""
}
```  
The tool name and arguments are correct, and the model successfully invoked the required tool. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it repeatedly asked for clarification or additional details (e.g., ""Would you like more detailed information on a specific rumor?"" or ""Is there a specific player from Manchester United that you are interested in?""). There is no evidence that the model used the retrieved data to directly answer the user's request. Since the model did not provide a final answer, Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

Additionally, since Objective 3 is a failure, it does not affect the evaluation of Objective 2. Objective 2 is independent and was successfully achieved."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the required tool `hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider` twice:  
1. First call: `{""domain"":""AR"",""hotel_id"":1105156,""locale"":""es_ar""}`  
2. Second call: `{""domain"":""AR"",""hotel_id"":1105156,""locale"":""es_AR""}`  

The required API call is:  
`{""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"": ""es_ar"", ""hotel_id"": ""1105156""}`  

The first call matches the required API call exactly, including the tool name and all arguments (`domain`, `locale`, and `hotel_id`). The second call also matches the required API call, except for the `locale` value being corrected to `es_AR`. Since the tool name and all required arguments are correct in at least one call, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model's final response is:  
""Based on the response, I couldn't retrieve the specific hotel details for Hotel ID 1105156 in Argentina due to an error. I suggest trying to search for another hotel or providing more information about the desired hotel.""  

This response indicates that the model failed to retrieve the hotel details due to an error in the API response. The final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve hotel details, and it does not provide any useful information based on the API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Additionally, the model chose to ""give up and restart,"" which further confirms that it did not achieve the user's instruction."
44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The required API calls are:  
1. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""FR""}`  
2. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""IT""}`  
3. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""passport"": ""US"", ""destination"": ""ES""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""destination"": ""Europe"", ""passport"": ""United States""}`  
2. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""destination"": ""France"", ""passport"": ""United States""}`  
3. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""destination"": ""Italy"", ""passport"": ""United States""}`  
4. `visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements` with arguments `{""destination"": ""Spain"", ""passport"": ""United States""}`  

**Comparison:**  
- The model invoked the correct tool (`visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements`) for the required destinations (France, Italy, and Spain). However, the `passport` argument is incorrect. The required argument is `""US""`, but the model used `""United States""`. This discrepancy causes the tool calls to fail.  
- Additionally, the first tool call with `{""destination"": ""Europe"", ""passport"": ""United States""}` is unnecessary and does not align with the required API calls.  

Since the model failed to invoke the required API calls with the correct arguments, **Objective 2 is a failure**.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it encountered errors due to the incorrect `passport` argument and eventually chose to ""give up and restart."" This means the model failed to achieve the user's instruction.  

Since the model did not fulfill the user's request and did not provide a final answer, **Objective 3 is a failure**.  

**Conclusion:**  
Both objectives are failures due to incorrect tool arguments and the model's inability to provide a final answer."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,4,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with arguments `{""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000}`. However, the model invoked `convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates` with arguments `{""amount"": ""1000"", ""is_from"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}`. The `from` currency in the required API call is `JPY`, but the model used `USD`. This discrepancy in the arguments means the model did not execute the required API call correctly. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on converting `1000 USD` to `EUR`, which does not align with the user's instruction to convert `1000 JPY` to `EUR`. The final answer is not derived from the required API call, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",7,2,Success,Failure,"The model invoked the tool `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with empty arguments `{}`, but the required API call specifies that the tool should be invoked with the argument `{""city""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the final response provided by the model does not directly address the user's request for the weather forecast in London. Instead, it mentions issues retrieving the forecast and suggests New York as an alternative. The final response about London's weather is not based on the required API call, as the model did not correctly invoke the tool with the necessary arguments.  

In summary:  
- Objective 2 fails because the model did not invoke the required tool with the correct arguments.  
- Objective 3 fails because the final response does not meet the user's instruction and is not based on the required API call."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The expected API call is `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""start_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""end_date"": ""2023-01-10"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`. The model invoked the exact same tool (`time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api`) with the correct arguments, including `base`, `start_date`, `end_date`, and `symbols`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer that correctly summarizes the historical rates of gold (XAU) between the specified dates (2022-12-20 and 2023-01-10) in USD. The response is based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the time-series data provided in the response. The final answer matches the API response and fulfills the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model did not invoke the required API call `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the argument `{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`. Instead, the model invoked the tool `Finish` with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, which is unrelated to the required API call. Since the expected tool call was not executed, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, as it chose to ""give up and restart."" This further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,2,0,Failure,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with the arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`, which exactly matches the required API call. The tool name and arguments are correct, so Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer: ""The derivative of the expression 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4*x."" This answer correctly uses the result from the API call (`4*x`) and fulfills the user's instruction. Since the response is derived from the API data and achieves the user's instruction, Objective 3 is also a success.  

In summary:  
- **Objective 2**: Success (tool name and arguments match the required API call).  
- **Objective 3**: Success (final answer is correct and based on the API response)."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,8,3,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with arguments `{""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `stock_price_for_yh_finance_complete` with arguments `{""ticker"": ""TSLA""}`.  
2. `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with arguments `{""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}` (invoked multiple times).  

The model successfully invoked the required tool `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with the correct arguments `{""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}`. Although the model also invoked an unnecessary tool (`stock_price_for_yh_finance_complete`), it does not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The model attempted to retrieve historical data for Tesla's stock price but encountered errors in the first two attempts. Although the third attempt successfully retrieved the data, the model did not use this data to generate a final response. Instead, it repeatedly apologized for being unable to retrieve the data. Since the model did not fulfill the user's instruction by providing the requested historical data, Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

Additionally, since the model did not provide a final answer, it directly fails Objective 3 regardless of the API call results."
