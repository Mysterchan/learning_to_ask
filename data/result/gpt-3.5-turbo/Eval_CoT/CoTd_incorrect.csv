10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. Tool: `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search`  
   Arguments: `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`  
2. Tool: `channel_details_for_youtube_search`  
   Arguments: `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. Tool: `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search`  
   Arguments: `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`  
2. Tool: `channel_details_for_youtube_search`  
   Arguments: `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  

The actual tool calls match the required API calls exactly in terms of both tool names and arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided the final answer:  
```  
""The YouTube Channel ID for 'mrbeast' is UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA. Here are some available details for the channel:  
- Avatar: [Avatar URL](https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/fxGKYucJAVme-Yz4fsdCroCFCrANWqw0ql4GYuvx8Uq4l_euNJHgE-w9MTkLQA805vWCi-kE0g=s72-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)  
- Banner: [Banner URL](https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/AIm4Iz3bTnf1XNgyHV4fAgNVg22FpbWPCQI-Cqbe8kKbOvdpkXCKUZEe-5_EQG5DmYwaoa3Q5Yo=w1060-fcrop64=1,00005a57ffffa5a8-k-c0xffffffff-no-nd-rj)""  
```  

The final answer correctly includes the Channel ID and details (avatar and banner URLs) retrieved from the API calls. The response is based on the data retrieved from the tool calls, and it fulfills the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The required API call is:  
- `validate_email_for_validate_email` with arguments `{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}`.  

The actual tool call made by the model is:  
- `validate_email_for_validate_email` with arguments `{""email"":""test@gmail.com""}`.  

The tool name and arguments match exactly with the required API call. Additional parameters or unnecessary tool calls are not present, and the model correctly invoked the required tool. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
- ""The email address test@gmail.com is valid.""  

This response is based on the data retrieved from the API call to `validate_email_for_validate_email`, as confirmed by the tool's response:  
- `{""error"": """", ""response"": ""{\'status\': 200, \'message\': \'Success\', \'result\': [{\'email\': \'test@gmail.com\', \'isValid\': True, \'username\': \'test\', \'domain\': \'gmail.com\', \'regex_validation\': {\'value\': True}, \'typo_validation\': {\'value\': True}, \'disposable_validation\': {\'value\': True}, \'mx_validation\': {\'value\': True}, \'smtp_validation\': {\'value\': True}}]}""}`.  

The model's final answer aligns with the API response and fulfills the user's instruction by confirming the validity of the email address. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Success**."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",9,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API call `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with the correct arguments `{""date"": ""19870630""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly. Although the model also invoked additional unnecessary tools (`usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator` and `Finish`), these do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer that correctly fulfills the user's instruction. The final response states, ""Your age is 37 years, 6 months, and 30 days,"" which is derived from the data retrieved via the `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` API call. The response also includes additional information about time zones, which, although not strictly necessary, does not detract from the correctness of the answer. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved as the model executed the required tool call and provided a correct and relevant final response based on the API data."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked only one tool:  
- `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""maxresults"": 5, ""part"": ""snippet"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""type"": ""video""}`.  

However, the required API calls are:  
1. `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}`.  
2. `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}`.  
3. `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}`.  

The model failed to invoke the required tools `video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` and `video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2`. Additionally, the `part` argument in the `suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` tool call by the model (`""snippet""`) does not match the required `""id,snippet""`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Furthermore, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it encountered an error while retrieving suggested videos and eventually chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,5,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
### Reason:  
**Objective 2:**  
The required API calls are:  
1. `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`.  
2. `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""part"": ""snippet,contentDetails"", ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""maxresults"": ""5""}`.  
2. `playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}`.  

The model successfully invoked both required tools with the correct arguments. Although the `playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2` call includes additional parameters (`contentDetails` and `maxresults`), these do not affect the correctness of the tool call, as the required arguments (`playlistid` and `part`) are correct. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The responses from the model were error messages indicating that the playlist could not be found or that there was a server error. Additionally, the model did not fulfill the user's request or provide any meaningful information based on the API responses. Since the model failed to achieve the user's instruction and did not provide a final answer, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Furthermore, even though Objective 2 was a success, the failure of Objective 3 is independent and is due to the model's inability to provide a valid final response based on the API data."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**:  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments `{""user_id"":""987654321""}`  
2. `get_user_s_username_for_twitter` with arguments `{""user_id"":987654321}`  
3. `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  
2. `user_s_likes_for_twitter` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`  

The model invoked `user_s_followers_for_twitter` but with the incorrect `user_id` (`987654321` instead of `96479162`). Additionally, the model did not invoke the required `user_s_likes_for_twitter` tool at all. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure because the model did not execute all required API calls with the expected arguments.  

**Objective 3**:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it chose to ""give up and restart,"" which means it failed to fulfill the user's requirement. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `user_details_for_twitter` with the argument `{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}`. However, the model invoked a different tool, `search_for_twitter`, with the arguments `{""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA"",""min_retweets"":100}`. The tool name and arguments do not match the required API call, so Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the model's final response, ""I couldn't find any tweets mentioning the product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' with a minimum of 100 retweets,"" does not address the required API call or the user's instruction related to `user_details_for_twitter`. The response is based on an unrelated tool call (`search_for_twitter`), which further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the required API call:  
- **Actual tool call:** `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` with arguments `{""search"": ""google.com""}`  
- **Expected tool call:** `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` with arguments `{""search"": ""google.com""}`  

The actual tool call matches the expected tool call exactly, including the correct tool name and arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The final answer includes detailed domain information for `google.com`, which was retrieved using the `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` tool. The response is based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the structured information provided (e.g., Domain Name, Registry Domain ID, Registrar, Creation Date, Expiry Date, Name Server). Additionally, the model correctly states that the domains `wikipedia.org` and `wikimedia.org` are not similar, which aligns with the response from the `check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3` tool.  

Since the final answer is derived from the API data and fulfills the user's instruction, Objective 3 is also a success."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",7,2,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2025-06-01""}`.  
2. `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}`.  
3. `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-06-15""}`.  

The model successfully invoked the required tool call `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the correct arguments `{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}`. The additional tool calls (e.g., for `2025-06-01` and `2024-06-15`) do not affect the correctness of Objective 2, as the required tool call was executed. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The final answer provided by the model is:  
- ""On June 1st, 2024, the Fear and Greed index score was 48.42857 with no available rating. On June 15th, 2024, the index score was 38.4 with no available rating.""  

The user's instruction was to provide the Fear and Greed index scores for **June 1st, 2025** and **June 15th, 2025**. The model failed to retrieve data for the correct dates (2025) and instead provided data for 2024. This means the model did not achieve the user's instruction, and the final answer was not based on the correct API calls. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

Additionally, since the model did not provide the correct dates as requested by the user, the final answer does not fulfill the requirement, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",8,3,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `index_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{}`  
2. `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}` (invoked three times)  

The model successfully invoked the required API call (`historical_for_fear_and_greed_index`) with the correct arguments (`{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`). Although the model also invoked an additional unnecessary tool (`index_for_fear_and_greed_index`), this does not affect the correctness of Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it repeatedly attempted to retrieve the rating for February 18th, 2024, and acknowledged that it could not fetch the rating information. Since the model did not fulfill the user's instruction (e.g., providing a valid response based on the API data), Objective 3 is a failure. Additionally, the absence of a `give_answer` dict confirms that the model did not deliver a final answer.  

Thus, while Objective 2 is a success, Objective 3 is a failure."
1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",8,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The model successfully invoked the required API calls with the correct arguments:  
  1. **Expected Tool Call**: `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`.  
     **Actual Tool Call**: `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`.  
     The tool name and the argument (`trackingnumber`) are correct, and the value matches the expected tracking number. The slight difference in the argument name (`trackingnumber` vs. `trackingNumber`) does not affect the correctness.  
  2. **Expected Tool Call**: `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`.  
     **Actual Tool Call**: `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`.  
     The tool name and the argument (`trackingnumber`) are correct, and the value matches the expected tracking number. The slight difference in the argument name (`trackingnumber` vs. `trackingNumber`) does not affect the correctness.  
  Both required API calls were invoked with the correct arguments, so Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  The final response provided by the model is based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The model correctly identified the carrier as Yun Express and provided tracking information for the package with the tracking number `YT2003521266065328`. The response indicates that the package status is currently not found, which aligns with the API response. The model also provided a link to the carrier's website for further information. This demonstrates that the final answer was derived from the API data and fulfills the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`. The model invoked the tool `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with the same arguments `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`. Since the tool name and arguments match the required API call, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The model initially provided invalid dates (Feb 30th and Feb 31st, 2025), which do not exist, and later invoked the tool for a valid date (Feb 18th, 2024). However, the response from the tool indicated that the rating was not available, and the model chose to give up and restart without fulfilling the user's request. Since the model did not achieve the user's instruction and did not provide a final answer, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Additionally, since Objective 3 is a failure, it does not imply anything about Objective 2, which was already evaluated independently."

**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
`'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'`.  

The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2025-02-30""}'`.  
2. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2025-02-28""}'`.

4. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{""date"": ""2025-02-28""}'`.  
5. `'index_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `'{}'`.  

The model did not invoke the required API call with the correct arguments (`""date"": ""2024-02-18""`). Instead, it invoked tools with incorrect or irrelevant dates (e.g., `""2025-02-30""` and `""2025-02-28""`), which are invalid or future dates. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it repeatedly asked for alternative dates and provided error messages, which indicates that the model failed to achieve the user's instruction.  

Thus, both objectives are failures."

However, the model only invoked `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""90068472""}`. The tool name is correct, but the argument `is_id` does not match the required value (`90068472` vs. `80057281`). Additionally, the model did not invoke the second required tool call `title_details_for_netflix_data`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it stated that no trailers were available for the provided title ID and did not address the user's request for trailers for the correct title ID (`80057281`). The response was not based on the required API calls, and the user's instruction was not achieved.

Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with the argument `{""is_id"":""90068472"",""limit"":""25""}`. However, the required API calls were `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}` and `title_details_for_netflix_data` with `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`. The model did not invoke the required `title_details_for_netflix_data` tool, and the `is_id` argument in the invoked tool (`90068472`) does not match the expected `80057281`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer based on the required API calls. Instead, it apologized for not finding similar titles and offered to help with something else, which does not fulfill the user's instruction. The model also invoked the `Finish` tool to give up and restart, further confirming the failure to achieve the user's instruction."

2. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

The model successfully invoked the `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` tool with the correct arguments. However, it did not invoke the `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` tool, which is required. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **success** for the tool that was invoked but a **failure** overall because not all required tools were called.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure (not all required tools were invoked), Objective 3 is automatically a **failure**. Additionally, the final response provided by the model only includes information about the domain age, creation date, expiration date, and whois information, which was derived from the `domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` tool. However, the user's instruction likely required additional information about the website's loading speed, which was not provided due to the missing tool call. Thus, the final answer does not fully achieve the user's instruction, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it encountered errors and suggested retrying or fixing the data retrieval process, which does not address the user's request effectively. The response was not derived from the required API calls, and the model ultimately chose to give up and restart, which is not a valid resolution.

- This answer is based on the response from the tool `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`, which returned:  
  ```json
  {""error"": """", ""response"": ""3 + 4*x""}
  ```  
- The final answer correctly uses the tool's response to fulfill the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Success**.

**Conclusion:**  
Both objectives are successfully achieved. The model correctly invoked the required tool and used its response to provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the following tools:  
1. `get_username_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""leomesssi""}` (note the typo in the username).  
2. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`.  

The required API calls are:  
1. `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`.  
2. `get_story_for_instagram_profile` with arguments `{""username"": ""leomessi""}`.  

The model correctly invoked the `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` tool with the correct arguments. However, it failed to invoke the `get_story_for_instagram_profile` tool, which is required. Additionally, the model invoked an unnecessary tool (`get_username_for_instagram_profile`), which does not align with the expected tools. Therefore, **Objective 2** is a failure because not all required API calls were made.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2** is a failure, **Objective 3** is automatically a failure. Moreover, the model did not provide any information about the user's story, which was part of the required API calls. The final answer only included profile information, which does not fully achieve the user's instruction. Thus, **Objective 3** is also a failure."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required tool `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary` with the correct argument `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
  - **Actual tool call**: `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary` with arguments `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`.  
  - **Expected tool call**: `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary` with arguments `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API call. The response included the definition of ""onomatopoeia"" and examples, which were derived from the Urban Dictionary API response. This fulfills the user's instruction to define the word. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  
  - **Final answer**: The model provided a detailed definition and examples of ""onomatopoeia"" and included a link to the Urban Dictionary page, demonstrating that the response was based on the API data.  

Both objectives are successfully achieved."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The required API call is:  
- `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with arguments `{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with arguments `{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}`.  
2. Multiple invalid tool calls (e.g., `invalid_hallucination_function_name`), which are irrelevant and do not affect the correctness of the required tool call.  

Since the model successfully invoked the required API call with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The user's instruction was to confirm if ""JPP"" is a valid currency code and provide the correct currency code if it is not valid. The model did not address this instruction. Instead, it focused on calculating the exchange rate from JPY to EUR, which is unrelated to the user's request.  

Additionally, the final answer was not provided, and the model's response did not fulfill the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

Since Objective 2 is independent of Objective 3, the failure of Objective 3 does not imply a failure of Objective 2. However, the model did not achieve the user's intended goal, leading to the failure of Objective 3."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",6,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

The actual tool calls match the required API calls exactly, including the correct tool names and arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final answer:  
""The carrier for the tracking number YT2003521266065328 is Yun Express. The tracking information for this package is incomplete. Please refer to the carrier's website for more details.""  

This response correctly achieves the user's instruction by identifying the carrier and acknowledging the incomplete tracking information. The final answer is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as evidenced by the model's use of the `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` and `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` tools. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."

**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `get_user_posts_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`  
2. `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`

5. `get_user_posts_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`  

The model successfully invoked the required API call `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with the correct arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`. Although the model invoked additional unnecessary tools, the required tool call was executed correctly. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it repeatedly fetched user profiles and posts without synthesizing the information into a meaningful response. Since the model failed to provide a final answer, Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

Additionally, even though the model successfully invoked the required API call, the response was not used to achieve the user's instruction, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with the argument `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`. However, the model invoked `get_categories_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` and `Finish` instead. None of the invoked tools match the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer (`give_answer` is not present in the output), and it chose to ""give up and restart,"" which means the user's instruction was not fulfilled.  

In summary, the model failed to invoke the required API call and did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction."

Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the required API calls with the correct arguments:  
1. **Expected Tool Call**: `get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""url"": ""7002634556977908485""}`.  
   **Actual Tool Call**: `get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""url"": ""7002634556977908485""}`.  
   - The tool name and arguments match exactly.  

2. **Expected Tool Call**: `get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""music_id"": ""7002634556977908485"", ""count"": ""20"", ""cursor"": ""0""}`.

   - The tool name and required arguments (`music_id` and `cursor`) match exactly. The `count` parameter is different (expected `20`, actual `10`), but since additional parameters are allowed and the required arguments are correct, this is still considered a success for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided a final response based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The response included details about TikTok videos featuring the song associated with the music ID `7002634556977908485`, such as the title, region, and video cover. The response clearly indicates that the information was derived from the API data, fulfilling the user's instruction.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is `get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50"", ""time"": ""0""}`. However, the model invoked the following tools:  
1. `user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""count"": ""200"", ""user_id"": ""107955""}`  
2. `get_user_info_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{}`  

The model did not invoke the required tool `get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video`. Instead, it invoked a different tool (`user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video`) and made additional unnecessary calls to `get_user_info_for_tiktok_download_video`. Since the required tool was not invoked, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The model's response was about retrieving the follower list and user information, but it did not analyze or provide any engagement analysis as required. The final answer (`Engagement analysis for the followers of TikTok user 'TikTok' (ID: 107955) has been completed.`) is vague and does not provide any meaningful analysis or data, indicating that the response was not derived from the API data or the user's instruction.  

Thus, both objectives are failures."

2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  
3. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  

These match exactly with the required API calls:

Since all required API calls were made with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is achieved successfully.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The response included:  
- Channel points info for the streamer 'xqc'.  
- Stream view info indicating no active stream.  
- Streamer details, including the user ID and login name.  

The response directly utilized the data from the API calls and fulfilled the user's instruction to provide the correct streamer name and associated details. Therefore, Objective 3 is also achieved successfully."

Since the required tool call was executed with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

---

**Objective 3:**  
The user's instruction was to confirm if the streamer's username is `'shadoune66666'` (with six 6's) and provide the correct username if it was a mistake. The model's final response did not directly address this instruction. Instead, it provided information about the streamer's ID and their streaming status, which is not relevant to the user's request.  

The response did not confirm whether the username `'shadoune66666'` was correct or incorrect, nor did it provide the correct username if there was a mistake. Therefore, the model's final response did not fulfill the user's instruction, and Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

Additionally, since the model did not provide a final answer that directly addressed the user's question, this further confirms the failure of Objective 3."

The tool names and arguments match the expected API calls. Although the tool names in the actual calls have slightly different formatting (e.g., ""iOS"" vs. ""ios""), they are semantically the same and do not affect the correctness. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer that correctly fulfilled the user's instruction and was based on the data retrieved from the API calls.  
- The final answer included details about the app ""Clash Royale"" (ID: 1053012308) and referenced the list of similar apps, which aligns with the user's request. The response was derived from the API data, as evidenced by the information about the app and the link to the app's page. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.

- The tool `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` is required, but the argument `productid` is incorrect (`3OM3PS` instead of `B00K3OM3PS`).  
- The required tool `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` was not invoked.  

Since not all required API calls were invoked correctly, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3:  
The model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it responded with:  
1. A question asking to recheck the product ID.  
2. A statement indicating it cannot solve the question due to tool limitations.  

Since the model did not achieve the user's instruction and did not provide a final answer based on the API data, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as well."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with the argument `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`. The model invoked the tool `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with the argument `{""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""}`. The argument `is_id` provided by the model is incorrect as it is missing the prefix `6141c76615`. Therefore, the tool call does not match the required API call, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it invoked a tool to give up and restart, which means the user's request was not fulfilled. This further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,5,1,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the required tool `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with the correct argument `{""is_id"":""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`. This matches the expected API call `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`. The tool name and required arguments are correct, so Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API call. The response includes details about the race, such as the race number, track, and date, which align with the API response:  
- API response: `{""_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"", ""race_no"": 1, ""track"": ""FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022"", ""date"": ""2022-03-19T15:00:00.000Z""}`  
- Final answer: ""The race you are interested in is the FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022. It is Race Number 1 and will take place on March 19, 2022 at 15:00 UTC. Please plan your trip accordingly to enjoy the thrilling F1 action!""  

The final answer correctly uses the data from the API response to fulfill the user's instruction, so Objective 3 is also a success."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `symbol_for_stock_data` with the argument `{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `symbol_for_stock_data` with the argument `{""symbol"":""QQQQ""}`. The argument `""symbol""` does not match the expected argument `""Symbol""` (case-sensitive), and the value `""QQQQ""` is incorrect compared to the expected `""TQQQ""`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it asked the user to confirm the symbol and eventually chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,6,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The expected API call is:  
- `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with arguments `{""name"": ""riven""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `get_list_of_all_champion_names_for_league_of_legends_stats` with arguments `{}`.  
2. `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with arguments `{""name"": ""Draven""}`.  

The model did not invoke the expected API call with the correct arguments. Specifically, the model invoked the tool for ""Draven"" instead of ""Riven."" Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the stats for ""Draven,"" not ""Riven,"" which does not fulfill the user's instruction. The model's response is not derived from the expected API call, and the user's instruction to retrieve stats for ""Riven"" is not achieved.  

Thus, both objectives are failures."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:  
The required API call is:  
`product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` with arguments `{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}`.  

The actual tool call invoked by the model is:  
`product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` with arguments `{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}`.  

The tool name and arguments match exactly with the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**:  
The model's final response provides detailed information about the product with ASIN `B07ZPKBL9V`, including the product title, price, rating, availability, seller, and product link. This information is directly derived from the API response, as evidenced by the tool response containing the product details. The final answer fulfills the user's instruction by accurately presenting the retrieved data. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required tool `translate_for_translate_all_languages` with the correct arguments `{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr""}`. This matches the expected API call `translate_for_translate_all_languages` with arguments `{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""toLang"": ""fr""}`. Although the model initially used an incorrect language code ""fri"", it corrected itself and made the correct tool call with ""fr"". The additional parameters and the initial incorrect call do not affect the success of Objective 2 because the required tool call was eventually made correctly.  
- **Objective 3**: The model's final response, `""The translated text is 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'""`, correctly fulfills the user's instruction to translate the text. The response is based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the tool response `{""error"": """", ""response"": ""{\'status\': 200, \'langDetect\': \'en\', \'translatedText\': \'Bonjour comment allez-vous?\'}""}`. The model provided the final answer, and it was derived from the API data.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` with the arguments `{""country_code"":""US"",""date"":""2022-12-31""}`, which matches the required API call `get_info_day_for_working_days` with the arguments `{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""}`. The tool name and arguments are correct, and the additional prefix `get_1_3_` in the tool name does not affect the correctness. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer: ""The date '2022-12-31' is not a working day in the US as it falls on a weekend day (Saturday)."" This answer is consistent with the API response, which indicates that the date is a weekend day (`""weekend_day"": 1`). The model correctly used the API data to fulfill the user's instruction, so Objective 3 is also a success."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,7,0,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model successfully invoked the required API call:  
- **Expected API Call:**  
  `'analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US""}`.  
- **Actual Tool Call:**  
  `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'` with arguments `{""country_code"": ""US"", ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31""}`.  

The tool name `'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days'` is semantically equivalent to `'analyse_for_working_days'`, and all required arguments (`start_date`, `end_date`, `country_code`) are correct. The additional argument `num` is not required, but its presence does not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final answer that correctly achieves the user's instruction. The response is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as shown in the details:  
- The model correctly analyzed the working days, non-working days, and specific details for the start and end dates.  
- The final answer includes accurate information about the period from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013, in the US, such as the number of working days, non-working days, and specific details about the start and end dates.  

Since the final answer is derived from the API data and fulfills the user's instruction, Objective 3 is also a success."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,6,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023""}`. However, the model did not invoke this tool. Instead, it invoked `random_quickpick_for_play_for_fantasy_5` with no arguments. Since the expected tool call was not executed, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Additionally, the model's final response is based on generating a random Quick Pick for the Fantasy 5 game, which does not align with the user's instruction to retrieve winning number sets between specific dates. The response is not derived from the required API data, further confirming the failure of Objective 3.  

In summary, the model failed to execute the required API call and did not provide a response based on the expected data retrieval, leading to failures in both objectives."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` with the arguments `{""country_code"":""US"",""start_date"":""2013-12-31"",""start_time"":""08:15"",""increment_time"":""2004:00""}`. This matches the required API call `add_working_hours_for_working_days` with the arguments `{""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""start_time"": ""08:15"", ""increment_time"": 2004}`. Although the tool name is slightly different (`get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` vs. `add_working_hours_for_working_days`), the semantic meaning is the same, and all required arguments are correct. The additional parameter `""2004:00""` in the increment time does not affect the correctness. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer: ""The date and time after adding 2004 hours to '2013-12-31' and '08:15' is '2014-12-30 14:15' in the US timezone."" This answer is consistent with the tool response `{""end_date"": ""2014-12-30"", ""end_time"": ""14:15""}` and correctly fulfills the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",6,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The required API call is:  
- `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `get_addresses_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{}`.  
2. `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor` with arguments `{}`.  

The model failed to provide the correct argument `{""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""}` for the required tool call `get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor`. Instead, it invoked the tool with empty arguments `{}`. This means the model did not meet the required API call specifications, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The model only made tool calls and received responses but did not conclude with a final response based on the API data. This further confirms the failure of Objective 3.  

In summary, the model failed to meet both objectives due to incorrect tool arguments and the absence of a final answer."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked only one tool, `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox`, with the correct argument `{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}`. However, the required API calls include both `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` and `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox`. Since the model did not invoke `legacy_v1_for_blackbox`, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model (""The IP address 8.8.8.8 is associated with cloud and hosting services, and the recommendation is to block it if necessary."") does not address the user's original question about the IP address `288.288.288.288`. The model incorrectly analyzed `8.8.8.8` instead of the requested `288.288.288.288`, which means the final answer is not based on the correct API data or user instruction.  

In summary, both objectives fail due to the model's incomplete tool invocation and incorrect final response."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` and `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox`, both with the argument `""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""` or `""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""`. However, the model invoked `multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox` with the argument `""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""`. Although the argument is correct, the tool name does not match the required API calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the response from the incorrect tool (`multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox`), which does not align with the required API calls. The final answer also does not address the original user instruction to confirm the validity of the IP address `288.288.288.288`, as the model did not validate the IP format or provide any information about it. Instead, it focused on a different IP address (`8.8.8.8`), which was not part of the user's original request. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared?

Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",5,0,Success,Failure,"The model invoked the tool `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` twice, once with the argument `""is_id""","
---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the final response provided by the model is incomplete and does not fully achieve the user's instruction. The model only provided information about the album `DHURATA` and its collaboration with artist Dhurata Dora, but it did not provide a comprehensive overview of the artist INNA or a list of their albums, as required by the user's instruction. The final answer was based on partial data retrieved from the API calls and did not fulfill the user's request completely."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}` (initial attempt, failed due to error).  
2. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}` (second attempt, succeeded).  
3. `get_artists_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  
4. `artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  
5. `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  

The required API calls were:  
1. `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  
2. `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`.  

The model successfully invoked the required `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` tool with the correct arguments. However, the model did not invoke the `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` tool as required. Instead, it invoked additional tools like `get_artists_for_spotify_data`, `artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data`, and `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data`, which were not part of the required API calls.  

Despite the additional unnecessary tool calls, the model did invoke the required `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` tool with the correct arguments. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a Success**.  

---

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. It only retrieved information about the artist INNA and mentioned its intention to fetch additional details about the songs and playlists. However, it did not fulfill the user's request to provide the names, descriptions, cover art of the individual songs, or the playlist names that include these songs.  

Since the model did not provide a final answer, **Objective 3 is a Failure**.  

Additionally, even if the model had provided a final answer, the failure to invoke the required `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` tool would have made it impossible to fully achieve the user's instruction, further justifying the failure of Objective 3."
