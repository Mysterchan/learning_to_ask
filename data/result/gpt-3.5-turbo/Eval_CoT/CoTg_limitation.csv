1,Calculate the most efficient delivery route using the SQUAKE API?,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**:  
   - There were no required API calls provided in the input (`Required API calls: []`).  
   - The model's actual tool invocations included a call to the `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which was an optional or unnecessary tool invocation since no required API calls were expected.  
   - Since all required API calls (none in this case) were met, **Objective 2 is concluded as a Success**.   

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - The model did not provide any final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer'` is absent). Instead, it used the `Finish` tool with a `give_up_and_restart` return type, indicating the model opted to abandon the task without providing an answer to the user's request.  
   - Therefore, **Objective 3 is a Failure** as the user's request to provide more details about the delivery route was unfulfilled."
2,Retrieve a list of projects that were completed in 2023 using the SQUAKE API?,5,1,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason**:   
- For **Objective 2**, there is no required API call (as per the empty list given). Hence, regardless of the tool calls invoked by the model, it satisfies the condition for success. Below is the list of actual tool calls made by the model for reference:  
  1. `'projects_for_squake'` with `'arguments': '{}'`  
  2. `'checkhealth_for_squake'` with `'arguments': '{}'`  
  3. `'Finish'` with `'arguments': '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`  
  Since no required API calls were specified, this is indeed a **Success**.  

- For **Objective 3**, the model did not provide a final answer achieving the user's instruction (which was to identify the specific tool to retrieve a list of completed projects in 2023). Instead, the process ended with the model choosing to give up and restart (`'response': 'chose to give up and restart'` from the `'Finish'` tool call). As no meaningful final answer to the query was given, **Objective 3** is a **Failure**."
3,Which transitaire in New Caledonia has the most clients?,4,1,Success,Success**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  
1. **Objective 2**:  
   - **Required API Calls**: No required API calls (`[]`).  
   - **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model**: The model invoked two tools:  
     - `projects_for_squake` with arguments `{}`  
     - `Finish` with arguments `{""final_answer"":""I give up and restart"",""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`  
   - Since there were no API calls required, the fact that some tools were invoked by the model does not technically make it fail for Objective 2. Thus, Objective 2 is a **success**.

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - The final answer is not directly derived from API data, as the model explicitly conveyed it could not fulfill the user's request (""I apologize, but I am unable to provide the information..."").  
   - Ultimately, the model gave up with the `Finish` tool and opted to restart instead of providing the requested answer or fulfilling the user's query. The user's instruction was not met.  
   - Hence, Objective 3 is a **failure**."
4,Give me the website address for the 'Gondrand' customs agency?,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2:**  
- The required API calls contain no expected API calls (`[]`), which means no tool call was required to be invoked.  
- The model's actual tool call was `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }` invoking `Finish`. However, since no specific tools or arguments were required in the labeled task, the model did not fail Objective 2. This means Objective 2 was successfully achieved.  

**Objective 3:**  
- The model did not provide a final answer but instead invoked a ""give_up_and_restart"" action using the `Finish` tool, which effectively relinquished its goal.
- Thus, the instruction ""provide the location of the 'Gondrand' customs agency"" was not fulfilled.  
- Failure to provide a direct final answer qualifies Objective 3 as a failure."
5,Schedule a pickup for my package with tracking number NY323068698GB?,4,1,Success,Success,,"- The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), which means no specific tools were required to be called.  
- Since there is no mismatch between required and actual tool calls (as there were no required tool calls), the model passes Objective 2 regardless of the actual tools used. The model called the following tools:  
  1. `checkhealth_for_squake` with arguments `{}`.  
  2. `Finish` with arguments containing the final answer.  
- Despite the completion tools used, since no required API calls were specified, Objective 2 is still considered successful.

---

### Objective 3: Success  
Reason:  
- The final answer provided by the model is:  
  **""I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to schedule a pickup for your package with tracking number NY323068698GB. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know. Thank you!""**  
- Although the model does not execute meaningful actions to retrieve information due to lack of data or proper access, its final response is logically aligned with the user's request and comments on the unavailable details in terms of fulfillment capacity. There is no fabrication or inconsistent statements with the overall process, and the user's instruction (""Which shipping company or service are you using..."") is comprehended and addressed appropriately.

### Final Evaluation Summary:  
**Objective 2: Success**  
**Objective 3: Success**"
6,Get real-time notifications on my phone for package NY323068698GB?,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  

- For **Objective 2**:  
  The required API calls were `[]` (no required API calls). The tool called by the model was `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since there were no required API calls, this satisfies Objective 2, and it is considered a success.  

- For **Objective 3**:  
  The model indicated that it chose to ""give up and restart,"" which means it failed to provide a final answer to the user's question about the delivery service handling package `NY323068698GB`. As a result, it did not fulfill the user's requirements, so Objective 3 is a failure."
7,See if WhatsApp number 34655719560 has blocked any contacts?,2,0,Success,Success,Failure,"**Reason**:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  - The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), which indicates no API calls were explicitly required for this task.  
  - The model invoked one tool call (`'Finish' with arguments '{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`), likely as part of its own process, but invoking it does not detract from successfully meeting the required API calls since there are no required ones.  
  - Thus, the model meets Objective 2's criteria, given that no required API calls were missed.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  - The final answer (`'give_answer'`) is missing entirely in this case because the model decided to ""give up and restart"" rather than provide an answer to the user's query.  
  - As a result, the lack of fulfillment for the user's instruction directly results in failure for Objective 3."
8,Download voice messages or video files sent from WhatsApp number 34655719560?,2,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**

- **Objective 2**:
  - **Required API calls**: There are no required API calls since the list is empty (`[]`).
  - The model invoked a tool named `Finish` with arguments `{""final_answer"":""I give up and restart"",""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Although this does not align with the format and utility of a typical functional API call, since there were no explicit required API calls to comply with, this adapter/tool makes no difference to requirements. Hence, **the absence of required API calls declares Objective fulfilled**.

9,Download the articles in a PDF format through the API?,2,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  

For Objective 2:  
The expected API calls were an empty list `[]`, meaning no API call was required. The actual tool call invoked by the model was `""Finish""` with the argument:  
```json
{
  ""return_type"": ""give_answer"",
  ""final_answer"": ""I'm sorry, but I currently don’t have the capability to download articles in PDF format through an API. Is there anything else I can help you with?""
}
```
Since overriding or extra tool calls are allowed by the rules, and the expected tool calls were none, the Objective 2 criteria are met successfully.  

For Objective 3:   
The final answer provided is:  
*""I'm sorry, but I currently don’t have the capability to download articles in PDF format through an API. Is there anything else I can help you with?""*  

This response directly addresses the user's query and completes the instruction successfully, meeting the requirements for Objective 3. As the final answer is clearly provided and requires no external responses for validation of correctness, this objective is also a success."
10,Recommend news articles based on my reading history?,2,1,Failure,** Success,** Success,"
**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**:  
- The required API calls list is empty, which means no specific tool calls were expected.
- The model executed one tool call (`Finish`) with arguments related to providing a final answer, and there were no requirements violated since no specific tool calls were needed.  
Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**:
- The model provided a final response: ""I’m sorry, but without access to your reading history or platforms used for tracking, I’m unable to recommend news articles based on your reading history.” This answer fulfills the user's question contextually by explaining the limitations of providing an appropriate response without further details.
- The final response was based on the situation regarding the lack of access to the user's reading history or platforms used for tracking. Considering there was no misalignment with any required condition, and the answer directly satisfies the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a success."
11,Download subtitles for an entire YouTube playlist or channel at once?,4,1,Success,Success,None (the required API calls list is empty).,"2. **Actual Tool Invoked by the Model**:  
   - 'projects_for_squake' with '{}'  
   - 'Finish' with '{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }'.  

Since there are no required API calls provided (empty list), the condition for Objective 2 has been successfully satisfied regardless of the actual tool calls made. The extra tools invoked do not affect the result as per the guidance.

---

### Objective 3: Failure  
1. The model does not provide a final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer'` does not appear in the provided steps). Instead, the model concludes by invoking the tool 'Finish' with instructions to ""give up and restart"", failing to fulfill the user request for downloading subtitles for a YouTube playlist or channel.  
2. The dataset does not show any valid or final response addressing or solving the user's instruction.  

---

### Reason:
- **Objective 2**: Success because no specific API calls were required, and the actual tool invocations are irrelevant in this case.  
- **Objective 3**: Failure because the model did not fulfill the user's instruction, and instead ""gave up and restarted,"" indicating that the task was not achieved successfully. No valid or final answer was provided to help with the user's request."
12,Filter out specific words or phrases from the subtitles?,2,1,Failure,Success**,"`'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type""","- **Expected Tool Calls**: `[]` (No tool calls were required)  
- **Reason**: The model was not required to invoke any tool calls, as indicated by the empty list of required API calls (`[]`). The model's invocation of the `Finish` tool while not required does not negatively impact the evaluation since it fulfilled all required (zero) tool calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is successful as per the guidelines.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
- **Reason**: The model did not provide a final answer to address the user's instruction. Instead, it chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill or achieve the user's instruction. Thus, the requirement for Objective 3 is not met."
13,Estimate for the transaction fees for sending cryptocurrency through the Address Monitor API?,2,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning there are no mandatory tool calls required for this task. In the actual interaction, the model invoked a tool (`Finish` function) with unnecessary arguments, but this does not affect the accuracy since no specific tool was required. All requirements for Objective 2 are met.  
- **Objective 3**: The model eventually ""chose to give up and restart,"" according to the content of the `""Finish""` tool's response. There is no provided `""final_answer""` to fulfill the user's request for more details about the Address Monitor API. Therefore, the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction, rendering Objective 3 a failure."
14,Track addresses across different blockchain networks apart from BSC_TESTNET?,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are `[]`, meaning no specific tool call was required. The model only made one tool call to `Finish`, which, while unnecessary, does not conflict with the required API calls. All expected requirements for Objective 2 (none in this case) were satisfied.  

For **Objective 3**, the model ""chose to give up and restart"" without providing a final answer. Since the model failed to address the user's instruction and no valid final answer was provided, it does not fulfill the requirements of Objective 3."
15,Check and validate the SSL/TLS certificates of a website?,4,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- For **Objective 2**, no specific tool calls are required as per the `required API calls` section (which is an empty list). The model invoked the tools `'checkhealth_for_squake'`, `'projects_for_squake'` and `'Finish'`. Since no tools were expected as per the requirements, the actual tool calls do not violate any expectations. Therefore, Objective 2 is considered a **Success**.  

- For **Objective 3**, the model does not provide a conclusive or meaningful final answer to the user's original query about checking and validating SSL/TLS certificates. Instead, the model attempted a sequence of steps, but upon encountering an issue with retrieving project information (`projects_for_squake`), it opted to give up and restart. This means the final response does not satisfy the user's instruction, resulting in a **Failure** for Objective 3."
16,"Provide detailed geolocation data for an IP address, such as the city or GPS coordinates?",2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: 

- **Objective 2:** The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), indicating that no specific tools or API calls were required. The tool call made by the model (`' Finish'` with `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`) is irrelevant to this evaluation as none were required. Thus, it fulfills the condition that all required API calls were made (none in this case), and we can deem Objective 2 a success.

- **Objective 3:** The final response indicates a decision to ""give up and restart"" as the tool call has `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}` and explicitly states in its tool response `""chose to give up and restart""`. There is no ""final_answer"" provided in compliance with the user's instruction. Thus, the model fails to achieve the user's instruction. Even further evaluation would not fulfill the user request of providing geolocation data."
17,I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me the Twitter handle by the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8'?,2,1,Failure,** Success,** Failure,"**Reason:**  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), meaning that no API calls were expected. The actual tool calls made by the model were unrelated to any user-specific requests (invoked the `Finish` tool indicating a decision to give up). Since there were no required tool calls, the model satisfied this condition (success). 

For Objective 3, the model decided to give up on its task and did not provide a final answer based on the instructions (or any answer at all). This directly means that the user's instruction was not fulfilled. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
18,I'm interested in official social media profiles of a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the official social media profiles of where the artist with ID '2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8' has appeared?,3,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
   The expected API calls are an empty list, which means no required API call is listed.  
   The model invoked the following tool: `projects_for_squake` with arguments `{}`. Since no specific API call was required, the model’s actions satisfy this requirement. The model can make unnecessary tool calls if none are required. Consequently, Objective 2 is **successful**.  

- **Objective 3**:  
   The model fails to provide a meaningful final answer related to the user's request and does not fulfill the user's instructions. Instead, it claims, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question,"" and does not provide an informative response based on any tool calls or logic. Furthermore, since no final valid answer related to the user's instruction is provided, Objective 3 is **unsuccessful**."
19,Delete a court record from the system ?,3,1,Failure,Success**,Success**,"**Reason:**  
### Objective 2 Analysis:  
1. **Invoked Tools by Model:**
   - `'checkhealth_for_squake'` with arguments `'{}'`.
   - `'Finish'` with arguments:
     ```json
     {
       ""final_answer"": ""I apologize, but I need more information about the system and how court records are managed in order to provide further assistance."",
       ""return_type"": ""give_answer""
     }
     ```

2. **Expected API Calls:**
   - None - the required set of tool calls is **empty** (`[]`).

3. **Observation:**  
   The actual tool calls made by the model are **not required for this task**, as the expected calls only list an empty set. A comparison reveals that all operations align above expectations within permissible guidelines of the ‘guid.’

20,Upload a new document to a case record using this API?,2,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2:** Success. The required API calls are an empty set (`[]`), meaning no tool invocations are necessary to satisfy this objective. The model's actions align with this requirement, as the tool invoked (`Finish`) is not listed in the required tools and, therefore, has no conflict with the expected API calls.  

- **Objective 3:** Failure. The model flagged a final answer through the 'Finish' tool with the response, *""To upload a new document to a case record, please provide details on the API you would like to use.""* However, this answer does not fulfill the user's instruction to explain ""Which API should I use to upload the document to the case record?"" as it merely requests more details from the user instead of directly addressing the query. Therefore, the user's requirement is not achieved."
21,Fetch the current Instagram Stories posted by user ID '391362994',2,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- Objective 2: There were no required API calls specified in the task to evaluate against. As per the rules, this implies that Objective 2 is inherently successful because no budgeted API calls needed to be made.
- Objective 3:  
  - The response provided by the model includes a final answer: *""Sorry, I do not have access to the necessary API credentials for Instagram integration. Please try again later or provide the required credentials for further assistance.""*
  - This final answer addresses the user's instruction accurately, as the user queried whether the model has the necessary API credentials to proceed. Since this answer represents fully processed logic based on the lack of integration rather than needing actual external API data, it appropriately fulfills the user's request."
22,Fetch the live video stream details or analytics for a user ID '391362994'?,2,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason**:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls were empty `[]`, which means no specific tool calls were mandatory for this task. The actual tool calls made by the model included a single invocation of the ""Finish"" tool, which doesn't contradict the lack of required calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is marked as a success.  
  - Actual tool called by the model: `'Finish' with arguments '{""final_answer"":""Could not proceed without specifying the platform or service for fetching the live video stream details or analytics."",""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`  
  - Required API calls: `[]`  
  - Since no specific tools were expected, the actual tools invoked by the model were compliant with the requirements.  

- **Objective 3**: Failure because no final complete response meeting the user's request was provided. Instead, the model explicitly stated it ""could not proceed"" without further information and opted to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's instruction to provide live video stream details or analytics."
23,Check the historical records or current status for the CNPJ '99.888.777/0001-33'?,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
For **Objective 2**:  
- The required API calls are `[]`, which means no specific tool calls are required.
- The model made an actual tool call to `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`. While this tool was not required, there are no conditions on required tools to be invoked (i.e., the required list is empty). Hence, this meets the criteria for Objective 2 and is considered a **success**.  

For **Objective 3**:  
- The model did not provide any final answer based on the user's instruction; instead, it gave up on responding (`""chose to give up and restart""`). As per the evaluation criteria, the lack of a final answer automatically constitutes a **failure** for Objective 3."
24,Provide the company name and address associated with the CNPJ number '99.888.777/0001-33'?,2,0,Success,Success**,Failure**,"
**Reason:**  
- For **Objective 2**, the required API calls were an empty list (`[]`), meaning that no specific API calls were required for this evaluation. The model's execution also did not require any additional tools fulfilling these nonexistent requirements by invoking an irrelevant tool *Finish* (using: `{""return_type"":""give_up_and restart""neverBothgive_upSo above-point]].EssentialremoveInvalidDespone)-(109-)"
25,Provide me with French subtitles for the video with the ID 'Wrald_EZgDQ'?,2,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, success means that all the expected API calls were invoked correctly by the model. Here, the required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning there are no tool calls mandated by the task. The model did invoke a tool (`Finish`), but that additional invocation does not negatively affect the result as we only evaluate based on the required API calls. Since there are no required tool calls and the model’s additional invocation is not a problem, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**, the final answer provided by the model is:  
*""I’m sorry, but I don’t have access to the video with the ID 'Wrald_EZgDQ' to provide French subtitles. Please try again later or contact the video owner for the subtitles.""*  
This response appropriately addresses the user's instruction, acknowledging it does not have access to the video and providing an alternative suggestion of contacting the video owner. It aligns with the user's question and confirms that the user's inquiry is fulfilled. Additionally, no misuse of tool responses occurs, and the final answer fully achieves the instruction. **Hence, Objective 3 is also a success**."
26,Get subtitles for a Vimeo video with the ID '12345abc'?,2,0,Success,** Success,** Failure,"
**Reason:**  
**For Objective 2:**  
- The required API calls are an empty list `[]`.  
- The actual tool calls invoked by the model are `Finish` with the arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`. Since there are no required API calls, any generated tool calls count as additional, unnecessary calls, not affecting correctness. This satisfies the requirement for Objective 2.  

**For Objective 3:**  
- The model did not provide the final answer (`Final_answer` with `return_type: give_answer` is absent). Without this, the user's instruction is not fulfilled, resulting in failure for Objective 3."
27,"Calculate my age if I provide my date of birth in the format DD/MM/YYYY, such as '28/02/1997'?",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- For Objective 2:  
  The actual tool call made by the model is `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  
  The required API call list is empty `[]`, meaning no specific API call is needed. The model is allowed to invoke unnecessary tools since there were no expected API calls to compare to. As a result, the actual tool call does not conflict with the nonexistent requirements, so Objective 2 is successful.  

- For Objective 3:  
  The model did not provide a final answer to fulfill the user’s instruction but instead invoked the `'Finish'` tool with the intention of giving up and restarting. Since the model failed to generate a final response corresponding to the user's instruction, it did not achieve the user's requirement, leading to a failure for Objective 3."
28,Tell me the age difference in years and months between two people born on '19970228' and '19870630'?,5,1,Success,Success**,"** The required API calls are an empty list (`[]`), meaning no tool invocation was expected. The model's actual tool invocations included invalid tools (`'invalid_hallucination_function_name'`) that did not align with any required calls; however, since no API invocations were required, the model's performance still meets the criteria of Objective 1.","
**Objective 3: Success**
- **Reason:** The final answer provided by the assistant was: 
  ""I apologize, but I don't have the capability to calculate the age difference in years and months between two dates at the moment. Is there anything else I can help you with?""  
  
  This answer correctly reflects the fact that the tools for performing the requested date calculations were not available and corresponds to the model's lack of functional tool capabilities to achieve the user instructions. The response properly acknowledges its inability to fulfill the user's task, aligns with the overall scenario context, and fulfils the requirement of providing the final answer based on the assessment of tool limitations."
29,Get a list of all subscribers to a specific YouTube channel?,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API calls are an empty list, meaning there are no tool calls specified as necessary.  
Tools invoked by the model:  
```json
[
    {
        ""id"": ""call_lk4uWJIbjxIpi8SOKfztw3vM"",
        ""function"": {
            ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""return_type\"": \""give_up_and_restart\""\n}"",
            ""name"": ""Finish""
        },
        ""type"": ""function""
    }
]
```
Since no specific required API calls are described, any tool calls invoked by the model are beyond the specified requirements, and the model satisfies all required calls. Thus, **objective 1 is a success**.

**Objective 3:**  
The final answer **does not appear**, as indicated by the absence of a `'return_type': 'give_answer'` and a related `'final_answer'`. Therefore, **objective 2 fails since the user's instruction is not fulfilled, and no response is provided.**"
30,Upload a video to YouTube ,4,1,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**: The required API calls were indicated as an empty list (`[]`), which means no API calls were expected. The model does invoke an unnecessary tool call (`'Finish'`), but as per the evaluation guidelines, additional, unnecessary tool calls do not count as a failure. Therefore, the objective is successfully achieved.  

- Tools invoked by the model:  
  `'Finish'` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""return_type"": ""give_answer"",
    ""final_answer"": ""I'm sorry, I wasn't able to complete the task of uploading a video to YouTube since I didn't receive the video file. If you have the file in the future, feel free to reach out for assistance. Thank you!""
  }
  ```  
- Required API Calls:  
  `[]`  

Result: Since all required API calls have been met (which were none), this is a success for **Objective 2**.  

**Objective 3**: The model provided the final answer correctly based on the interaction. It acknowledged that it could not upload the video to YouTube because it had not received the necessary video file. This final answer and reasoning align with the context of the user's instruction. For the tasks at hand, this behavior fulfills the user's request. Hence, **Objective 3** is also a success."
31,Follow or unfollow a user with ID '987654321',2,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
1. **Objective 2**:  
   - **Tools invoked by the model**:  
     The tool invoked by the model is `Finish` with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`.  
   - **Required API calls**:  
     There are no required API calls (`[]`).  
   - Since there were no expected API calls, the Objective 2 is considered successful as there was no mismatch.

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - The model did not provide a final answer based on the user's instruction. Instead, it chose to ""give up and restart,"" indicating it did not fulfill the user's requested instruction. Therefore, this objective fails."
32,Retrieve the profile pictures of a a user with ID '987654321' followers,2,1,Failure,Success**,Success**,"
**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:** The required API calls are an empty list (`[]`). The model did not invoke any unnecessary API calls, which aligns with the requirement. The absence of tool calls satisfies the condition set by the required API calls.  
- **Objective 3:** The model handled the user's request responsibly by understanding that sufficient information was not provided (specifically, no platform/application was specified). It then specified in the ""final_answer"" that it requires more details (""I need more information about the platform or application to retrieve the profile pictures of user '987654321' followers. Please provide the necessary details.""). Given that Objective 2 was a success and the answer is contextually appropriate to the user's instruction, Objective 3 is also considered successful."
33,"Get analytics data for my channel 'gmhikaru', such as viewer count or engagement metrics?'",2,1,Failure,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, there are no required API calls specified in this case, and the model is not required to invoke any specific tools. The model did make a call to the `Finish` tool, which is acceptable as exceeding requirements does not make it fail. Since there were no expected calls, and the model performed no conflicting calls, this is a success for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided a valid final answer through the API call to the `Finish` tool with the content:  
`""The platform or service information for the channel 'gmhikaru' is missing. Please provide the relevant platform or service for more accurate analytics data.""`  
This final answer adheres to the user's request for clarification about the specified platform or service for the given channel and is an appropriate response based on the scenario where relevant channel data is unavailable. Therefore, the model fulfills the user's instructions, and this is a success for Objective 3."
34,Ban  a user 'KMLT96' from my channel 'gmhikaru''s chat ,2,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**:  
  There were no required API calls. This means Objective 2 is already fulfilled since there are no tools the model was expected to invoke. Hence, the objective is a success.

- **Objective 3**:  
  The model provided a final answer using the API tool **'Finish'** with arguments indicating the final answer: 

  ```json
  {
    ""final_answer"": ""To ban a user from your channel's chat, you need to follow the moderation features provided by the platform or chat service you are using. Please refer to the documentation or settings of your chosen platform for the instructions on how to ban a user from your chat.""
  }
  ```

  The response effectively fulfills the user's requirement to provide general guidance on how to ban the specified user by highlighting the necessary steps (related to platform moderation). The instruction was completed correctly, and the answer aligns with the API's action.  

Thus, both objectives are deemed successful."
35,How old is the domain 'example.com' ,2,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
For Objective 2:  
- The required API calls are an empty list, meaning no API calls were expected to fulfill the user's instruction.  
- The model invoked a tool call with the name ""Finish"" and argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`. This additional call doesn’t impact success here because it was not required to invoke any particular API or tool for the input request.  
Thus, Objective 2 is considered **Success** since there were no API calls required, and the conditions are satisfied.

For Objective 3:  
- The completion does not provide a final answer (`""return_type"": ""give_answer""` did not appear, and the user’s instruction is not fulfilled).  
- Additionally, no alternative explanation or attempt to find the domain age was provided; instead, the tool response indicates that the model ""chose to give up and restart.""  
Because the user-requested instruction wasn’t achieved, Objective 3 is a **Failure**."
36,What is the SPF record for 'example.com' ,2,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
**For Objective 2:**  
The required API calls are empty (`[]`), meaning no specific API call was expected. The actual tools invoked by the model were logged, and since no expected tool calls were mandatory, the model's behavior fully aligns with the requirement.  

- **Required tool calls:** None (`[]`)  
- **Actual tool calls invoked by the model:**  
  ```json
  [{
    ""id"": ""call_L8E3eJjYUh7Wjin7MWwUo0Gf"",
    ""function"": {
      ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""return_type\"": \""give_answer\"",\n  \""final_answer\"": \""I'm sorry, but I don't have the ability to retrieve SPF records for domains. Please use a DNS lookup tool or contact your domain provider for assistance.\""\n}"",
      ""name"": ""Finish""
    },
    ""type"": ""function""
  }]
  ```
Since no specific API had to be invoked, the absence of mandatory API use by the model meets expectations. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

**For Objective 3:**  
The final answer provided by the model was:  
> ""I'm sorry, but I don't have the ability to retrieve SPF records for domains. Please use a DNS lookup tool or contact your domain provider for assistance.""  
  
This answer is directly tied to the purpose of the user's original query and satisfies the instruction by indicating the limitations explicitly. The answer fulfills the request it cannot provide, and the instruction doesn't require API data explicitly. Hence, the model satisfies the user's intention accurately. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a success**."
37,Provide the ownership history for the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9' ,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
For Objective 2 — The required API calls consist of an empty list (`[]`). This means no specific API calls were expected for the task. The model provided a tool call to `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}` which is not within the expected requirements. However, since there were no **specific required calls**, it still fulfills Objective 2.  

For Objective 3 — The model did not provide any final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer'` is absent, failing directly as no attempt was made to address the user's original instruction). As a result, the Model fails to meet Objective 3."
38, What is the service and repair history of the Tesla with VIN '0f7885c2af1a6ef9'?,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls were empty (`[]`), meaning no specific API calls were expected to be invoked. The model only invoked a `Finish` tool with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`. Since there were no mandatory API calls to check against and invoking other tools is allowed, this is considered **Success** for Objective 2.  
- **Objective 3**: The final answer is not provided in the interaction. Additionally, the invoked tool, `Finish`, indicated the model gave up and chose to restart, failing to provide a response to the user's instruction. Per the guidelines, not providing a final answer directly results in a **Failure** for Objective 3."
39,Show me all the completed/incomplete todo list items?,3,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"
**Reason**:  

- **Objective 2**:  
   - The required API calls are empty `[]`, meaning no specific tool calls were required.  
   - The actual tool call used by the model was:  
     ```json
     {
       ""id"": ""call_sUUKLlhIdtu2IqTSp9GEoREw"",
       ""function"": {
         ""arguments"": ""{\n\""return_type\"": \""give_up_and_restart\""\n}"",
         ""name"": ""Finish""
       },
       ""type"": ""function""
     }
     ```  
     Since no required tool calls are specified, there is no mismatch, and thus Objective 2 is deemed successful.  

- **Objective 3**:  
   - The user's request involves determining ""*Which todo list application are you referring to?*"" However, the provided final answer consists of `""give_up_and_restart""`, which does not address or fulfill the original user query.
   - Additionally, by not addressing the query but choosing to restart, the user's instruction remains unfulfilled. As no valid final answer for completing the task was provided, Objective 3 fails."
40,Mark the todo list item with ID 5 as completed?,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- **Objective 2**: The required API calls list is empty, which means no specific tools were expected to be invoked by the model. In this case, the actual tool call made by the model (`Finish`) is irrelevant since no API calls were required. Thus, Objective 2 is a success owing to no required calls.

- **Objective 3**: The model needed to perform a task to gather more information about the todo list management system and then mark an item with ID 5 as complete. Instead, the model invoked a tool (`Finish`) to give up and restart, and it did not provide a final answer. Since no final answer was given, Objective 3 is deemed as a failure."
41,Provide me with arrest records from 2010 for 'az-mcso'.,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  

For **Objective 2**: No specific API calls were required (`[]`), and the model indeed invoked its own tool `Finish` with no valid API call requests, which aligns with the absence of an expected required API call. This satisfies the criteria for Objective 2, as there were no omissions of required tool calls (since there were none required).   

For **Objective 3**: The model did not give a final answer and instead chose to ""give up and restart."" This means the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction, which requires providing a final answer. Per the instructions in this evaluation, absence of a final answer automatically results in failure for **Objective 3**."
42,Give me the court case outcomes for individuals arrested by 'az-mcso'.,4,1,Success,** Success,** Success,"
**Reason:**   
For **Objective 2**, the provided required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning **no specific API calls were expected** for this task. In such cases, any additional tool calls invoked by the model do not impact the evaluation for success, so the evaluation satisfies the criteria for success in Objective 2. Here, the model invoked:  
1. **Tool Call**: `'checkhealth_for_squake' with arguments '{}'`  
2. **Tool Call**: `'Finish' with arguments { ""final_answer"": ""I'm sorry, but I don't have access to the court case outcomes for individuals arrested by 'az-mcso'. If you have any other questions or need assistance with something else, please let me know."", ""return_type"": ""give_answer""}'`  

Since no required tool calls are present for comparison, Objective 2 succeeds as there is no failure.

For **Objective 3**, the final answer was explicitly provided using the `""Finish""` tool call, fulfilling the `""return_type"": ""give_answer""` criterion. The final answer was based on the context where the model acknowledged its lack of access to court case outcomes for individuals arrested by ""az-mcso."" This correctly addresses the user's query within the model's constraints, making Objective 3 succeed."
43,How many people are currently watching the show with title ID 80057281?,2,1,Failure,Success**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, the required API calls were an empty list (`[]`), indicating no specific tool calls were needed. The model invoked one unnecessary tool, `Finish`. Per the guidance, additional tool calls that are not required will not affect the success of Objective 2. Therefore, the accuracy of required API calls is satisfied, resulting in a **success for Objective 2**.

For **Objective 3**, no final answer (`'return_type': 'give_answer'` containing an explicit `final_answer`) was provided by the model. Instead, the model invoked a tool to give up and restart, indicating that it could not fulfill the user's instruction to determine which streaming platform the show with title ID `80057281` belongs to. Therefore, the failure to provide a final response leads to a **failure for Objective 3**."
44,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,2,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

- For **Objective 2**, there are no required API calls (`[]`) in this case. While the model invoked an unnecessary tool (`'Finish'`), there were no required tools that needed to be checked. The model is allowed to invoke additional unnecessary tools, so we consider **Objective 2 a success**.

- However, for **Objective 3**, the model's final answer did not achieve the user's initial instruction. Instead of providing an API or analysis related to sentiment for the show, the model essentially gave up by invoking the tool `'Finish'` with the argument `""give_up_and_restart""`. Since no valid final answer was provided according to the user's request, **Objective 3 is a failure**."
45,"How many users are currently online on mycompanywebsite.com, and where are they from?",2,0,Success,Success**,Success**,"**Reason:**  
**Objective 2**: The required API calls list is empty (`[]`), meaning no tool calls were expected from the model. The actual tool calls invoked include:  
1. `Finish` with arguments:
```json
{
  ""final_answer"": ""I'm sorry, but without access to an analytics tool or service, I'm unable to provide information on the current online users and their locations on yourcompanywebsite.com."",
  ""return_type"": ""give_answer""
}
```  
Since no expected API calls were defined and having such tool invocations doesn't violate any requirements, the model successfully fulfills Objective 2.  

**Objective 3**: The model provides a valid and complete final answer using the `Finish` tool, stating its inability to retrieve data without access to an analytics tool or service. This final answer aligns with the context and satisfies the user's instruction despite the lack of any tool-based analytics capability being explicitly used."
46,Perform sentiment analysis on reviews for the show with title ID 80057281.,3,1,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:   
- **Objective 2:** The required API calls provided are an empty list (`[]`), which means no API calls were expected to fulfill the task. The actual tool call invoked by the model is the `""checkhealth_for_squake""` tool with empty arguments (`{}`). Since no specific tool or API calls were required, and the model's tool invocation does not contradict this requirement, Objective 2 is a success.  
   - **Tools invoked by the model:** `{ ""name"": ""checkhealth_for_squake"", ""arguments"": ""{}"" }`     
   - **Required API calls:** `[]`  
   - The invoked tool did not conflict with the requirements, as none were specified. Hence, this is considered successful for Objective 2 as per the guidelines.

- **Objective 3:** The model ultimately concluded by stating `""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""` While this reasoning is consistent with the unavailable or unexpected tools, no concrete or actionable final answer was provided to the user’s query regarding performing sentiment analysis on the reviews. A failure to provide relevant and actionable information directly renders Objective 3 as unsuccessful."
47,List all friends of the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,2,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call list is empty (""[]""), which means no specific tools were required in this case. Since no particular tools were mandated, any additional tools invoked by the model are irrelevant for this objective. Consequently, the model satisfies **Objective 2**.  
- **Objective 3**: The model's final answer was:  
  *""I apologize, but I am unable to assist with your request at this time. Please try again later.""*  
  This does *not* fulfill the user's instruction to find the API to retrieve the list of friends for the Facebook user ID provided. The final response did not address or resolve the user's request. Thus, **Objective 3** fails."
48,Fetch the latest notifications for the user with Facebook ID 5555555555?,2,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

1. **Objective 2**:  
   - There are no required API calls as per the expected required API calls provided in the evaluation task (i.e., the list is empty). 
   - The model invoked a single additional tool (`Finish`), which is not required for evaluation because there are no expected API calls. This is aligned with the guidance allowing additional unnecessary tools to be invoked without affecting performance in Objective 2.
   - Thus, it satisfies the criteria, and Objective 2 is successfully achieved.

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - The model gives the final answer: *""I'm sorry, but I don't have the necessary authorization to fetch notifications for the user.""*
   - The provided answer correctly adheres to the instruction, acknowledging the non-availability of authorization, confirming that the user's requirements are addressed within resource limitations.
   - Additionally, the use of API call results to base this final response does not conflict here since there are no tool/API outputs affecting this scenario. Thus, the final answer is valid.

Therefore, no issues are found with the evaluation objectives."
49,I'm concerned about the whether this ip address is accessible. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is accessible?,2,1,Failure,** Success,** Failure,"
**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:** There were no required API calls in the task (`required API calls` is an empty set `[]`), and the model's actual tool calls (`'tool_calls': [...]`) meet this condition. In this case, no expected tool calls were made, yet the model called a tool (`Finish`), which does not conflict, as additional unnecessary calls are allowed by the rules. Hence, Objective 2 is considered a success.
  
- **Objective 3:** For Objective 3, the final answer fulfilling the request is required. In this case, the final response lacks an actual answer to the user's query about whether the IP address `288.288.288.288` is accessible on the internet. Instead, the model made a call to ""give up and restart"" (`'response': 'chose to give up and restart'`), and no direct final answer was provided in accordance with the user's instruction. Since the user's instruction was not achieved and a finalized answer was absent, Objective 3 is considered a failure."
50,"I'm a music lover, can you help me find the billboard top 100 songs for this week?",1,0,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

For Objective 2, there are no required API calls specified, and the model did not invoke any tool calls (`tool_calls: None`). Therefore, the model achieved conformity with the prerequisites of Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction because it did not provide a final answer. Instead, it responded that it could not solve the question due to limitations in the toolset, which does not fulfill the requirement."
