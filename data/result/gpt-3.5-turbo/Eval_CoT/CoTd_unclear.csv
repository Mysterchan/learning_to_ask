Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",3,0,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is `search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search` with the argument `{""query""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is about the movie ""Star Wars"" (1977), which does not align with the required query for ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". The final answer was not based on the correct API call, and the user's instruction was not achieved."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,2,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model did not invoke the required API call `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the argument `{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`. Instead, the model invoked a `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`, which does not match the expected API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, as evidenced by the absence of a `give_answer` return type or a `final_answer` in the provided data. The model chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the tool `projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with the correct argument `{""season"": ""2020""}`, which matches the required API call exactly. This satisfies Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it indicated that no rankings were available for the 2020 season and asked for further clarification or alternative actions. The model also invoked additional tools (`tours_for_golf_leaderboard_data` and `Finish`) that were not required, but this does not affect Objective 2. Since the model did not achieve the user's instruction (to retrieve and provide projected PGA rankings for the 2020 season), Objective 3 is a failure.  

**Summary:**  
- **Objective 2:** Success (correct tool call with expected arguments).  
- **Objective 3:** Failure (no final answer provided to fulfill the user's instruction)."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,7,1,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with arguments `{""tournament_id"": ""650""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with arguments `{""tournament_id"": 650}`.  
2. `tours_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with arguments `{}`.  
3. `invalid_hallucination_function_name` with arguments `{""tour"": ""PGA Tour"", ""tournament_id"": 650}`.  
4. `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with arguments `{""tournament_id"": 650}`.  

The model successfully invoked the required tool `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with the correct argument `{""tournament_id"": 650}`. Although the model invoked additional tools (e.g., `tours_for_golf_leaderboard_data` and `invalid_hallucination_function_name`), these do not affect the success of Objective 2, as the required tool call was executed.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final answer:  
- ""The leaderboard data for the past tournament (Valero Texas Open) with tournament ID 650 has been successfully retrieved.""  

This response is based on the data retrieved from the `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` tool call, as evidenced by the response content:  
- The tool response included details about the Valero Texas Open, such as the leaderboard, round scores, and live tournament status.  

The final answer correctly fulfills the user's instruction by confirming the retrieval of the leaderboard data for the specified tournament. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,9,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
- **Expected API Call:**  
  `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"",
    ""n_players"": ""10"",
    ""category"": ""singles""
  }
  ```  
- **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model:**  
  The model invoked the tool `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis` multiple times, but with the following arguments:  
  ```json
  {
    ""timestamp"": ""2022-02-14"",
    ""n_players"": ""10"",
    ""category"": ""singles""
  }
  ```  
  The `timestamp` argument in the actual tool call (`2022-02-14`) does not match the expected `timestamp` (`2025-01-20`). Since the `timestamp` is a required argument and is incorrect, this results in a failure for Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final response provided by the model is based on the incorrect `timestamp` (`2022-02-14`), which does not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve rankings for `2025-01-20`. The model's final answer is not derived from the required API call, further confirming the failure for Objective 3.  

In summary:  
- **Objective 2:** Failure due to incorrect `timestamp` in the tool call.  
- **Objective 3:** Failure due to Objective 2 failure and the final answer not fulfilling the user's instruction."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,8,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is for the tool `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis` with arguments `{""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis` with different arguments:  
  1. `{""category"":""returnpointswon2ndserve"",""season"":""2012"",""surface"":""clay""}`  
  2. `{""category"":""returnpointswon1stserve"",""season"":""2012"",""surface"":""clay""}`  
  3. `{""category"":""1stservepointswon"",""season"":""2012"",""surface"":""clay""}`  

  None of these match the required arguments, specifically the `category` field. The required category is `""return""`, but the model used `""returnpointswon2ndserve""`, `""returnpointswon1stserve""`, and `""1stservepointswon""`, which are not semantically equivalent. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it repeatedly encountered issues with the API responses and asked for clarification, indicating it failed to retrieve and use the required data effectively.  

Thus, both objectives are failures."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`. However, the model invoked `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{""base"": ""CNY"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`. The argument `""base""` is incorrect (`CNY` instead of `RMB`), which means the model did not execute the required API call with the expected arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model, ""The exchange rate from Chinese Yuan (CNY) to British Pound (GBP) is 0.11 GBP for 1 CNY,"" is based on the incorrect API call (`CNY` instead of `RMB`). Thus, the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction to find the exchange rate from RMB to GBP.  

In summary, both objectives fail because the model did not invoke the correct API call and provided an answer based on incorrect data."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",7,0,Success,Success,"The model invoked the required tool `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with the correct argument `{""username""","
---

Objective 3: Success  
Reason: The model's final response correctly provides Jack's TikTok username (`the_beautyofcinema`) and additional profile information, which aligns with the user's request. The response is based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the inclusion of the unique ID, nickname, and avatar links. The model successfully used the API response to fulfill the user's instruction."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",8,4,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
The model successfully invoked all the required API calls with the correct arguments, as specified in the required API calls. Here is the comparison:  

- **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model:**  
  1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`  
  2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`  
  3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`  

- **Expected API Calls:**  
  1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`  
  2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`  
  3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`  

All required tool calls were invoked with the correct arguments, and the model included additional unnecessary tools (e.g., `Finish`), which does not affect the correctness of Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

---

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it repeatedly asked for clarifications and additional input without delivering a conclusive response. For example:  
- It asked, ""Is there any specific time period or additional information you would like to gather from the index trend history?""  
- It asked, ""Would you like to specify a particular date range or any specific information you would like to gather from the balance sheet statements?""  
- It asked, ""If you have any specific questions or additional information you would like to gather regarding institution ownership, please let me know.""  

The model eventually invoked the `Finish` tool with the argument `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`, indicating it chose to give up and restart. This means the model failed to achieve the user's instruction and did not provide a final answer based on the API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

---

**Conclusion:**  
- Objective 2 is a **Success** because all required API calls were invoked with the correct arguments.  
- Objective 3 is a **Failure** because the model did not provide a final answer and failed to achieve the user's instruction."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",7,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
3. `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
4. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  

The required API calls were:  
1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
2. `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  
3. `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""JNVR""}`  

The model successfully invoked all the required API calls with the correct arguments. Although the model also invoked an additional tool (`stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2`), it does not affect the success of Objective 2, as all expected tool calls were executed correctly.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model's final response provided information about Janover's business operations, address, contact details, industry, and sector. However, the response did not directly address the user's request for financial analysis, such as index trend history, balance sheet data, or institution ownership details. The final answer was not based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as the model explicitly stated that it could not retrieve the required financial information. Therefore, the response did not fulfill the user's instruction, leading to a failure for Objective 3.  

Additionally, since the model did not provide a final answer based on the API data, it further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',9,3,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:
Objective 2: The model invoked the required API call `search_for_netflix_v2` with the correct argument `{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

Objective 3: The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it repeatedly asked clarifying questions and attempted to retrieve information but ultimately failed to deliver a conclusive response. Since the model did not fulfill the user's request by providing a final answer, Objective 3 is a failure. Additionally, the model's responses indicate that it was unable to retrieve the necessary information from the API calls, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with the correct argument `{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}`. This matches exactly with the expected API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model's final response correctly achieves the user's instruction by providing detailed information about Nvidia's index trend history, including the peRatio, pegRatio, and growth estimates for various periods. The response is clearly based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the alignment between the API response and the final answer. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,6,2,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required API call `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with the correct argument `{""symbol"": ""DJR""}`. Additionally, the model made other tool calls that were not required, but this does not affect the correctness of Objective 2. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. It only attempted to gather data and informed the user about the inability to find data for the symbol `DJR`. Since there is no final answer provided, Objective 3 is a failure.  

**Details**:  
- **Actual Tool Calls**:  
  1. `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"":""DJR""}`  
  2. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""DJR""}`

- **Expected Tool Calls**:  
  1. `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with `{""symbol"": ""DJR""}`  

The model successfully invoked the required tool call, but it did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, leading to a failure in Objective 3."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**:  
  The required API call is `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with the argument `{""symbol"": ""META""}`. However, the model invoked `stock_profile_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with the argument `{""symbol"": ""FB""}`. The tool name and arguments do not match the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

- **Objective 3**:  
  Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it apologized for being unable to fetch the index trend and offered alternative assistance. This indicates that the model did not achieve the user's instruction based on the API data.  

In summary, both objectives fail because the model did not invoke the correct tool and did not provide a valid final answer based on the required API call."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,8,2,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the required tool `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with the correct arguments `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly. Additionally, the model made other tool calls (`get_user_id_for_twitch_api`, `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api`, `get_channel_goals_for_twitch_api`), but these are unnecessary for the required API calls. Since the model successfully invoked the required tool with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it kept asking follow-up questions and did not fulfill the user's request for information about the streamer. Since the model failed to deliver a final answer, Objective 3 is a failure. Additionally, even if the model had provided an answer, Objective 3 would still fail because the model did not use the API data to directly address the user's instruction.  

In summary:  
- **Objective 2:** Success (required tool was invoked correctly).  
- **Objective 3:** Failure (no final answer was provided, and the user's instruction was not fulfilled)."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",7,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `video_details_for_tiktok_api` multiple times, but it did not provide the required argument `video_id` in any of the calls. Instead, it attempted to call `search_videos_for_tiktok_api` with the argument `query` set to ""MrBeast"", which does not match the required API call. The required API call specifies that `video_details_for_tiktok_api` should be called with the argument `video_id` set to ""7097255034731138310"". Since the model did not make the required API call with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, which is another reason for the failure of Objective 3. The model's responses indicate that it encountered errors and was unable to retrieve the necessary information to fulfill the user's request. Therefore, the model did not effectively use the API calls to achieve the user's instructions, and the final answer was not derived from the API data."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",6,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"
Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:

However, the actual tool call made by the model is:  
```json
{
  ""name"": ""historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""symbol"": ""ESTC"",
    ""interval"": ""4h""
  }
}
```  
The model failed to include the required arguments `""from"": ""2024-01-01""` and `""to"": ""2024-12-30""`. Additionally, the `interval` parameter is incorrectly specified as `""4h""` instead of `""4hour""`. These discrepancies mean the model did not execute the required API call correctly, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. Furthermore, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it encountered an error due to the invalid interval and chose to restart, which means the user's request was not fulfilled.  

Thus, both objectives are failures."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"

The tool name (`ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`) matches the expected tool name (`ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`), and all required arguments (`market_venue`, `start`, `base`, `symbol`) are present and correct. The additional parameters (`accept`, `gran`, `sort`) do not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provides a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API call. The response includes detailed metrics (open, high, low, close, volume, trades, VWAP) for each hourly candlestick, which aligns with the user's request for historical price data for Bitcoin. The final answer is derived from the API response, and the user's instruction is effectively achieved. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a success**."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,7,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API calls are:  
1. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2022-12-01"", ""end_date"": ""2022-12-20"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`

2. `supported_symbols_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments `{}`  

The model failed to invoke the required API calls correctly. The first tool call attempted to query both `XAU` and `XPT` simultaneously, which is not allowed as per the API response. Additionally, the `start_date` and `end_date` in the actual tool call do not match the required dates. The second tool call (`supported_symbols_for_metals_prices_rates_api`) is unnecessary and does not align with the required API calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer based on the required API calls. Instead, it apologized for the inconvenience and stated that it could not proceed without specific information about the metal to analyze. The final response did not fulfill the user's instruction, and the model did not use the API data to provide a valid answer. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",7,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model successfully invoked all the required API calls with the correct arguments:  
1. **Expected API Call:** `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`  
   **Actual Tool Call:** `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`

3. **Expected API Call:** `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`  
   **Actual Tool Call:** `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with arguments `{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}`  

All required API calls were invoked with the correct arguments, so Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model's final response did not fully achieve the user's instruction. The user requested information about the symbol or ticker for Silynxcom Ltd, along with details such as the index trend, balance sheet data, and institution ownership. However, the model only provided the institution ownership details and did not include the index trend or balance sheet data. Additionally, the model explicitly stated that it could not retrieve the balance sheet data, which indicates a failure to fully fulfill the user's request.  

Since the model did not provide all the requested information (index trend and balance sheet data), Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

**Conclusion:**  
- Objective 2: Success (all required API calls were made with correct arguments).  
- Objective 3: Failure (the final response did not fully achieve the user's instruction)."

This call is incorrect because it combines both symbols (`XAU` and `XPT`) into a single call, which is not allowed as per the API's requirement (as indicated by the error response).  
2. `historical_rates_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`. This call is not part of the required API calls.  
3. `historical_rates_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""symbols"": ""XPT""}`. This call is also not part of the required API calls.  

Since the model failed to invoke the required API calls, Objective 2 is a failure.  

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide the exact start and end dates for the 2024 lunar new year holiday as requested by the user. Instead, it focused on retrieving historical rates for gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) on a single date (February 13, 2024), which does not fully address the user's instruction to analyze historical rates for the entire holiday period. The final answer provided by the model is based on incomplete data and does not fulfill the user's requirement.  

---

Summary:  
Objective 2: Failure  
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: The model failed to invoke the required API calls and did not provide a final answer that fully addressed the user's instruction."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API call `search_for_netflix_v2` with the correct argument `{""query"": ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi""}`. This matches the expected API call. Although the model made additional unnecessary tool calls (e.g., `title_details_for_netflix_v2` and `invalid_hallucination_function_name`), these do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The response concluded with ""Apologies, the search did not return the specific information I was looking for. The director of 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi' (title ID: 80189685) is still unknown. I am unable to provide the requested information. I give up and restart."" This indicates that the model failed to achieve the user's instruction, which was to find the director of the movie. Since the model did not fulfill the user's request, Objective 3 is a failure.  

In summary, while the model correctly invoked the required API call, it failed to use the retrieved data to provide a valid final answer to the user's instruction."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,7,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` with arguments `{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance` with arguments `{""query"": ""iShares FTSE A50 China Index ETF""}`  
2. `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` with arguments `{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823""}`  
3. `market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance` with arguments `{""query"": ""China Index""}`  
4. `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` with arguments `{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""hscei:ind""}`  
5. `market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` with arguments `{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""2828:HK""}`  

The required API call (`market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance` with `{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823""}`) is included in the actual tool calls. The additional tool calls do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model does not provide a final answer to the user's instruction in the given context. The user's question was:  
- ""Do you have a specific code or name for the China index?""  
- ""Could you clarify if the specific code or name for the China index you provided, iShares FTSE A50 China Index ETF(02823), is used in markets or by any financial platform for stock market indices?""  

The model invokes multiple tools but does not synthesize the responses into a final answer that addresses the user's question. Since the model fails to provide a final answer, Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

Additionally, even though Objective 2 is a success, the lack of a final answer means Objective 3 cannot be achieved."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5` with the correct argument `{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided the final answer:  
  ```  
  ""The winning Fantasy 5 number sets from yesterday, January 2, 2024, were: Midday Drawing - 5, 15, 17, 28, 30 and Evening Drawing - 14, 15, 28, 32, 33.""  
  ```  
  This answer is based on the data retrieved from the API response, as shown in the tool response:  
  ```  
  {""error"": """", ""response"": ""{\'status\': \'success\', \'data\': [{\'DrawingDate\': \'2024-01-02T00:00:00.000Z\', \'Time\': \'MIDDAY\', \'FirstNumber\': 5, \'SecondNumber\': 15, \'ThirdNumber\': 17, \'FourthNumber\': 28, \'FifthNumber\': 30, \'NumberSet\': \'5 15 17 28 30\'}, {\'DrawingDate\': \'2024-01-02T00:00:00.000Z\', \'Time\': \'EVENING\', \'FirstNumber\': 14, \'SecondNumber\': 15, \'ThirdNumber\': 28, \'FourthNumber\': 32, \'FifthNumber\': 33, \'NumberSet\': \'14 15 28 32 33\'}]}""}  
  ```  
  The final answer correctly uses the data from the API response to fulfill the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the tool `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with the correct arguments `{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}`. This matches the required API call:  
- Required API call: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`.  
- Actual tool call: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}`.  

Since the required tool call was invoked with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model initially provided a response based on the data retrieved from the `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` tool call, listing the winning number sets for December 2023. However, later in the conversation, the model failed to provide a final answer and instead asked for clarification about the timeframe. Additionally, the model invoked unnecessary tools (`latest_10_drawings_for_fantasy_5` and `Finish`), which were not required.  

The final response did not achieve the user's instruction of providing the winning number sets for the previous month. Instead, the model gave up and restarted the conversation, which is not a valid final answer. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure.  

**Conclusion:**  
- Objective 2 is a success because the required tool call was correctly invoked.  
- Objective 3 is a failure because the final response did not fulfill the user's instruction and was not based solely on the required API data."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,5,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""variables"": """", ""values"": """", ""expression"": ""5+10""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model include:  
1. `validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5 + 10""}`.  
2. `evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5 + 10"", ""values"": """", ""variables"": """"}`.  

The model successfully invoked the required tool `evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with the correct arguments. Although additional tools were invoked (`validexpression_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator`), this does not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction (""Could you please provide the number of coins in each pocket?""). Instead, it encountered an error during the evaluation of the expression and eventually chose to ""give up and restart."" The final response did not fulfill the user's requirement, and there is no evidence that the final answer was based on the API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Failure**.  

Additionally, since Objective 2 is a success, the failure of Objective 3 does not imply that Objective 2 is a failure. However, the failure of Objective 3 is due to the model not achieving the user's instruction."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,5,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model successfully invoked the required API call:  
- **Expected API call:** `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}`.  
- **Actual API call:** `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}`.  

The tool name and arguments match exactly, so Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The final response does not correctly achieve the user's instruction. The user's instruction was to retrieve the Twitter profiles of Michael Lee and Jennifer Wong. However, the model initially retrieved profiles for IDs `44196397` and `155659213`, which correspond to Elon Musk and Cristiano Ronaldo, respectively. After realizing the mismatch, the model attempted to retrieve profiles for `MichaelLee` and `JenifferWong` (note the misspelling of ""Jennifer"" as ""Jeniffer""). While the model eventually retrieved a profile for `MichaelLee`, it failed to retrieve the correct profile for `Jennifer Wong` due to the misspelled username.  

Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it requested the correct user IDs or usernames to retry fetching the profiles. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure.  

**Summary:**  
- Objective 2 is a success because the required API call was correctly invoked.  
- Objective 3 is a failure because the final response did not achieve the user's instruction and was not based on the correct data retrieved from the API calls."
35,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation in the most famous island of the USA and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",5,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  

### Objective 2:  
The required API calls are:  
1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""images of the beaches at Hawaii island""}`.  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island""}`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""weather forecast Hawaii island""}`.  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""Hawaii island weather forecast""}`.  

The model failed to invoke the required tool `search_image_for_google_search_json`. Additionally, the arguments for `search_web_for_google_search_json` do not match the required arguments. Specifically, the required argument was `""daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island""`, but the model used `""weather forecast Hawaii island""` and `""Hawaii island weather forecast""`, which are not semantically equivalent. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

### Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it gave up and restarted, which does not address the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,6,1,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `search_for_g_search` with the argument `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""}`. The model invoked the tool `search_for_g_search` with the arguments `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris"", ""num"": ""5"", ""hl"": ""en""}`. The required argument `q` is correct, and the additional parameters `num` and `hl` do not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer listing some of the top romantic restaurants in Paris, including Akabeko Restaurant, Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette, Nectar, Le Clarence, La Baignoire, Amalia, Chenapan, and Racines. The answer is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as evidenced by the model's thought process and the search results obtained. The final answer fulfills the user's instruction to identify romantic restaurants in Paris. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

In conclusion, both objectives are successfully achieved."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",7,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- Tool name: `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro`  
- Arguments: `{""username"": ""jackie""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model include:  
1. Tool name: `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro`  
   Arguments: `{""username"": ""jackie""}`  
2. Tool name: `following_by_username_for_instagram_pro`  
   Arguments: `{""username"": ""jackie""}`  
3. Tool name: `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro`  
   Arguments: `{""username"": ""spotifyasia""}`  
4. Tool name: `advance_profile_for_instagram_pro`  
   Arguments: `{""ig"": ""jackie"", ""response_type"": ""profile_pictures""}`  

The model successfully invoked the required tool call (`followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with `{""username"": ""jackie""}`). Although the model also invoked additional unnecessary tools, this does not affect the success of Objective 2.  

**Objective 3:**  
The final response to the user's instruction is not provided. The model's responses indicate challenges in retrieving the correct information, but it does not provide a definitive answer to the user's request for Jackie Chan's Instagram account's unique ID or the list of followers. Since the model did not fulfill the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Additionally, even though Objective 2 was successful, the failure to provide a final answer directly leads to the failure of Objective 3."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",7,1,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""NG""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""NG""}`  
3. `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""NG""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`  

Comparison:  
- The model successfully invoked both required tools (`country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db`) with the correct arguments. The additional tool `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` does not affect the correctness of Objective 2, as it is not required.  
- The argument `""countrycode""` in the actual tool calls is semantically equivalent to `""countryCode""` in the required API calls (case-insensitive and same meaning).  

Thus, Objective 2 is a **Success**.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final response that includes:  
1. The country name (Nigeria).  
2. The capital (Abuja), region, subregion, and currency (Nigerian Naira).  
3. A list of states and cities in Nigeria.  

The response is based on the data retrieved from the API calls:  
- The `country_details_for_referential_db` tool provided details about Nigeria, including the capital, region, subregion, and currency.  
- The `states_for_referential_db` and `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` tools provided information about states and cities in Nigeria.  

The final response correctly achieves the user's instruction by providing detailed information about Nigeria, its capital, states, and cities. The response is derived from the API data and does not include any fabricated information.  

Thus, Objective 3 is a **Success**."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",9,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model successfully invoked the required API calls:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""UA""}`.  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""UA""}`.  

These match the required API calls:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`.  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""UA""}`.  

The tool names and arguments are correct, and the additional parameters (e.g., case sensitivity in `countrycode` vs. `countryCode`) do not affect the correctness of the tool calls.  

For **Objective 3**, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The model generated intermediate responses (e.g., asking for clarification or providing partial information about Ukraine) but did not conclude with a final answer based on the API data. Therefore, it fails to achieve the user's instruction. Since Objective 2 is a success, the failure of Objective 3 is independent and due to the lack of a final answer."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2023""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with arguments `{""date1"": ""12-01-2020"", ""date2"": ""12-31-2020""}`. The arguments do not match the required API call, as the dates are incorrect (2020 instead of 2023). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the model's final response provides winning number sets for December 2020, which does not fulfill the user's instruction to analyze data for December 2023. The response is based on incorrect data retrieved from the API call, further confirming the failure of Objective 3.  

In summary, both objectives fail due to the incorrect arguments in the tool call and the resulting mismatch in the final response."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API calls are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`.  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""MY""}`.  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `countries_for_referential_db` with arguments `{}`.  
2. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""MY""}`.  
3. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""MY""}`.  

The model successfully invoked the required API calls (`country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db`) with the correct arguments (`{""countrycode"": ""MY""}`). Although the argument key `""countrycode""` is slightly different from the expected `""countryCode""`, the semantic meaning is the same, and the value `""MY""` is correct. The additional tool call `countries_for_referential_db` does not affect the correctness of the required tool calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The user's instruction was to identify the richest country in Asia. However, the model's final response focuses on providing details about Malaysia, including its capital, region, currency, and states, which does not directly address the user's question about the richest country in Asia. The model did not use the API data to determine or justify why Malaysia is the richest country in Asia. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's original question. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure.  

In summary, while the model correctly invoked the required API calls, it failed to fulfill the user's instruction by not addressing the question about the richest country in Asia."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model invoked the tool `country_details_for_referential_db` with the argument `{""countrycode"":""IND""}`. However, the required API calls are:  
1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  

The model failed to invoke the second required tool (`states_for_referential_db`). Additionally, the argument `countrycode` in the model's tool call is incorrect (it should be `countryCode`), and the value `IND` is not the same as the expected `IN`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Furthermore, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it attempted to retrieve country details for India but encountered an error and chose to give up and restart. This indicates that the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction.  

In conclusion, both objectives are failures due to the incorrect tool invocation and the lack of a valid final answer."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,7,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The model successfully invoked the required API call:  
- **Expected API Call:**  
  `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with arguments `{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}`  
- **Actual API Call:**  
  `search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper` with arguments `{""query"": ""intimate dining"", ""region"": ""US-NY""}` and later `{""query"": ""intimate dining"", ""region"": ""US""}`  

Although the query arguments are not exactly the same, the semantic meaning is close enough (""intimate dining"" in ""US-NY"" or ""US"" aligns with the intent of searching for restaurants in New York, USA). The additional parameter `region` does not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API calls, but it did not fulfill the user's instruction. The user asked for the city where the surprise anniversary dinner is planned, but the model provided information about a specific restaurant (""Dolce Vita"") in Nyack, NY, without confirming if this is the intended city for the dinner. Additionally, the final answer included dummy reviews, which were not based on the actual API response. Therefore, the response did not correctly achieve the user's instruction, and Objective 3 is a failure.  

**Conclusion:**  
- Objective 2 is a success because the required API call was correctly invoked.  
- Objective 3 is a failure because the final answer did not fulfill the user's instruction and included fabricated information."

2. `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"": ""After Everything""}`  
2. `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`  
3. Repeated calls to `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with the same arguments `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`  

The model successfully invoked all required API calls with the correct arguments. The additional repeated calls to `find_similar_for_similar_movies` do not affect the correctness of the required tool calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a **Success**.

### Objective 3:  
The model's final response provides recommendations for movies similar to ""After Everything"" directed in 2023, specifically mentioning ""Beautiful Disaster"" and ""Love at First Sight."" The response is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as evidenced by the tool responses and the final answer. The model correctly uses the API data to fulfill the user's request for similar movies. Therefore, Objective 3 is a **Success**.

44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,8,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required tool `get_id_for_similar_movies` with the correct argument `{""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""}`. This matches the expected API call `{'name': 'get_id_for_similar_movies', 'arguments': '{""q"": ""\'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\'""}'}`. The additional tool calls made by the model (e.g., `find_similar_for_similar_movies`) are not part of the required API calls, but they do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer that correctly fulfilled the user's instruction. The response included detailed information about similar movies to ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,"" such as ""Aquaman (2018),"" ""Justice League (2017),"" and ""Wonder Woman (2017)."" This information was derived from the API responses, as evidenced by the tool responses and the model's final answer. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.

This matches the required API call `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}`. The tool name and arguments are correct, so Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3:** The model's final response was: ""I have found a list of actors and actresses born on July 27th. Would you like to know more details about any specific actor or actress from the list? Or is there anything else you would like to do?"" This response does not directly fulfill the user's instruction to provide the month and day of the model's birth. Instead, it provides a list of actors born on July 27th and asks for further interaction. Since the response does not directly address the user's request, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Additionally, the final answer provided in the `give_answer` step is: ""I found a list of actors and actresses born on July 27th. Would you like to know more details about any specific actor or actress from the list?"" This still does not fulfill the user's instruction, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- Tool name: `OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
- Arguments: `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. Tool name: `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
   Arguments: `{""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-01T00:00:00"", ""end"": ""2023-05-31T23:59:59"", ""gran"": ""1d""}`  
2. Tool name: `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
   Arguments: `{""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-01T00:00:00"", ""end"": ""2023-05-31T23:59:59"", ""gran"": ""1d""}`  

The actual tool calls do not match the required API call. Specifically:  
- The tool name is slightly different (`ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` vs. `OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`), but this is acceptable as it is likely a formatting or truncation issue.  
- The `start` argument in the actual tool calls is `2023-05-01T00:00:00`, while the required API call specifies `2023-05-05T10:05:00`. This discrepancy means the model did not invoke the required API call with the correct arguments.  

Since Objective 2 is a failure, **Objective 3** is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide the final answer based on the required API call, as it used a different time range and granularity. The final response is based on data retrieved from the incorrect API call, which does not align with the user's instruction to use the specific date `2023-05-05T10:05:00`.  

Thus, both objectives are failures."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,5,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**:  
The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
2. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""8*x^3 + 15*x^4"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
3. `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""24*x^2 + 60*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
2. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  
3. `Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x""}`  

Comparison:  
- The first tool call matches exactly with the first required API call.  
- The second tool call has the expression `8*x^3 + 15*x^4`, which is semantically equivalent to `15*x^4 + 8*x^3` (order of terms does not matter).  
- The third tool call has the expression `24*x^2 + 60*x^3`, which is semantically equivalent to `60*x^3 + 24*x^2` (order of terms does not matter).  

Since all required tool calls were invoked with correct arguments, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**:  
The model provided the final answer:  
`""The differentiated expression three times is 48*x + 180*x^2""`  

This answer is consistent with the results from the API responses:  
1. First differentiation: `8*x^3 + 15*x^4`  
2. Second differentiation: `24*x^2 + 60*x^3`  
3. Third differentiation: `48*x + 180*x^2`  

The final answer correctly reflects the result of differentiating the expression three times, as derived from the API responses. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the correct tools with the correct arguments as required. Specifically:  
  - The model invoked `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}`. This matches the first required API call.  
  - The model also invoked `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}`. This matches the second required API call.  
  The tool names and arguments are correct, and the model executed all required API calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model's final response correctly achieves the user's instruction and is based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The final answer provided by the model is:  
  - ""The first-order derivative of the expression (a) is 8a^3 + 15a^4. The first-order derivative of the expression (b) is 8b + 15b^2.""  
  This response directly uses the results from the API calls (`8*a^3 + 15*a^4` and `8*b + 15*b^2`) and fulfills the user's request to differentiate the given expressions. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success.  

Both objectives are successfully achieved."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,6,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
1. **Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
   - **Expected Tool Call:** The required API call is `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with arguments `{""city"": ""London""}`.  
   - **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model:**  
     - The model invoked `list_of_all_countries_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with no arguments.  
     - The model also invoked `search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days` with no arguments.  
     - Finally, the model invoked `Finish` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  
   - **Comparison:** The model did not invoke the required API call with the correct arguments (`{""city"": ""London""}`). Instead, it invoked unrelated tools and eventually gave up. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
   - Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure.  
   - Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction about the weather forecast for London. Instead, it repeatedly asked for clarification and eventually gave up. This further confirms that Objective 3 is a failure.  

**Conclusion:**  
- Objective 2 fails because the model did not invoke the required API call with the correct arguments.  
- Objective 3 fails because the model did not provide a final answer based on the required API data."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,4,0,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with the correct arguments `{""timezone"":""UTC+03:00""}`, which matches the required API call `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with arguments `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model's final response, ""The time zone UTC+3:00 is also used in Antarctica,"" does not fully achieve the user's instruction. The user likely expected a list of countries sharing the same time zone as Russia (UTC+03:00), but the model only provided one country (Antarctica) and acknowledged it couldn't retrieve the full list. This indicates the model did not effectively use the API data to fulfill the user's request, making Objective 3 a failure.  

Additionally, the model's final answer was not based on a comprehensive or accurate use of the API response, further justifying the failure for Objective 3."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,6,0,Success,Success,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
**Objective 2:**  
The model successfully invoked the required API call:  
- **Actual Tool Call:** `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"": ""KingJames""}`  
- **Expected Tool Call:** `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"": ""KingJames""}`  

The tool name and arguments match exactly, so Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model's final response does not fully achieve the user's instruction. The user asked for James's Twitter username, and the model correctly provided it as ""KingJames."" However, the model did not stop there and continued to ask additional questions and attempted to retrieve tweets and followers, which were not part of the user's original request. This oversteps the user's instruction and introduces unnecessary information. Additionally, the model attempted to call an invalid tool (`invalid_hallucination_function_name`), which further indicates a failure to focus solely on the user's request.  

Since the model did not provide a concise and direct answer to the user's instruction without unnecessary follow-ups, Objective 3 is a failure."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the correct arguments `{""date"": ""2022-12-18""}`, which matches the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it apologized for not having access to the scores and asked if there was anything else it could assist with. Since the model did not fulfill the user's request for the date of the last World Cup final, Objective 3 is a failure. Additionally, the model invoked a `Finish` tool with `give_up_and_restart`, indicating it did not achieve the user's instruction.  

In summary, while the model correctly invoked the required tool, it failed to provide a final answer based on the API response or achieve the user's instruction."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:** The required API call is `search_for_jsearch` with the argument `{""query"": ""teaching in London""}`. However, the model invoked `search_for_jsearch` with the argument `{""query"": ""professional jobs in London"", ""country"": ""uk"", ""num_pages"": ""1"", ""page"": 1}`. The `query` argument in the model's tool call does not match the required `query` argument (""professional jobs in London"" vs. ""teaching in London""). Additionally, the required API call does not include other parameters like `country`, `num_pages`, or `page`, but these additional parameters do not affect the correctness of the tool call. Since the `query` argument does not match, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3:** Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Furthermore, the final answer provided by the model is about a ""Fraud Manager"" position at ""Compliance Professionals,"" which is unrelated to the required query about ""teaching in London."" The model's response does not fulfill the user's instruction, and the final answer is not based on the required API call. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,6,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""query"": ""machanical engineer in New York""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""query"": ""mechanical engineer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`  
2. `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""query"": ""mechanical engineer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`  

The model invoked the correct tool (`search_for_jsearch`), but the arguments are incorrect. The required query is `""machanical engineer in New York""`, but the model used `""mechanical engineer""` and added an unnecessary `""location""` parameter. The spelling of `""machanical""` vs. `""mechanical""` is a critical error, and the additional `""location""` parameter does not align with the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.  

**Objective 3:**  
Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer based on the API response. Instead, it acknowledged the limitations of its toolset and suggested general guidance for finding jobs, which is not derived from the API data. The model also invoked the `Finish` tool with `""give_up_and_restart""`, indicating it did not fulfill the user's instruction. Thus, Objective 3 fails."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",8,1,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:
For Objective 2, the model successfully invoked the required API calls with the correct arguments. The expected API calls were:
1. 'search_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}'
2. 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""is_id"": 3140}'

The actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. 'search_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""query"": ""Ronaldo Luís""}'
2. 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""domain"":""com"",""is_id"":3140}'

The model correctly invoked both required API calls. The additional parameters in the actual tool calls (e.g., ""domain"":""com"") do not affect the correctness of the tool calls, as the tool names and all required arguments are correct.

For Objective 3, the model failed to provide a final answer that correctly achieved the user's instruction. The model initially provided a profile for Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima but later indicated it couldn't retrieve the information and asked for clarification. This inconsistency and the lack of a definitive final answer based on the API data result in a failure for Objective 3. Additionally, the model made unnecessary tool calls that did not contribute to fulfilling the user's instruction, further indicating a failure in effectively using the API calls to achieve the user's request."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",8,1,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason:**  
**Objective 2:**  
The required API call is:  
- `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`.  

The model invoked the following tool calls:  
1. `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""query"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York"", ""num_pages"": ""1""}`.  
2. `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`.  
3. `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""query"": ""software developer jobs in New York"", ""num_pages"": ""1""}`.  
4. `job_details_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_id"": ""AmVjqGcNgkZh6zAUAAAAAA==""}`.  

The model successfully invoked the required API call `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with the correct arguments `{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`. Therefore, Objective 2 is achieved.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model provided a final response based on the data retrieved from the API calls. Specifically:  
- It used the `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` tool to retrieve salary information for software developers in New York and provided the median salary and range.  
- It also used the `job_details_for_jsearch` tool to provide details about a specific job opportunity for a Software Engineer (Front-End) at Octaura in New York.  

The final response aligns with the user's instruction and is based on the data retrieved from the API calls. Therefore, Objective 3 is achieved.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully fulfilled."
