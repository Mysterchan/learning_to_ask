1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",8,1,Success,Success,Success,"
**Reason**:  

1. **Objective 2** (Tool Invocation Evaluation):  
   The required API calls are as follows:  
   - `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`
   - `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with arguments: `{""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`

   The model invoked the following tools:  
   - `'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2'` with the arguments: `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`
   - `'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2'` with the arguments: `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

   Commentary:  
   Although the attribute names differ slightly (`trackingNumber` in the expected API versus `trackingnumber` in the invoked tools), based on the guidance (point 3 of Objective 2 evaluation), these are equivalent arguments, as they serve the same intent and reference the correct `trackingNumber`. Since the tool names and essential arguments from the model align with the expected required API, Objective 2 is met successfully.  

---

2. **Objective 3** (Final Response Evaluation):  
   The model gives the final answer wrapped in the `Finish` tool call as follows:  
   - **Final Answer**: `""The tracking information for the package YT2003521266065328 via Yun Express indicates that the status is not found currently. You can visit the carrier's website for more information: [Yun Express](http://www.yunexpress.com/). Feel free to check back later for updates on the package status.""`  

   - Traceback: The final answer aligns with the data retrieved from the API calls:
     - From the `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` tool response, the carrier's name (`Yun Express`) was accurately identified from the tracking number.
     - From the `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` tool response, the `notfound` status of the package's tracking details and the weblink (`http://www.yunexpress.com/`) are extracted and incorporated into the final answer.

   Thus, the final response is faithfully based on the retrieved API data and achieves the user instruction. Objective 3 is satisfied."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",6,1,Success,Success**,Success**,"
**Reason:**  

### Required API Calls  
1. **Tool Name:** `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`  
   **Arguments:** `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

2. **Tool Name:** `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`  
   **Arguments:** `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  

### Actual Tool Invocations by the Model  
1. **Tool Name:** `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`  
   **Arguments:** `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
   This matches exactly with the required API call for `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`.  

2. **Tool Name:** `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`  
   **Arguments:** `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
   This also matches the required API call for `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`.  

Therefore, **Objective 2 is achieved successfully**, as the model invoked the required API calls with correct arguments.

### Final Answer  
- The model provides the final answer:  
  `""The carrier for the tracking number YT2003521266065328 is Yun Express. The tracking information for this package is incomplete. Please refer to the carrier's website for more details.""`  
- This answer is based on and supported by the API responses:  
  - `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2`: Indicates incomplete tracking information.  
  - `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2`: Confirms the carrier is `'Yun Express'`.  
- The response fulfills the user's requirement by providing clear information about the tracking number's carrier and the incomplete tracking status, redirecting the user appropriately to the carrier's website for further details.

Thus, **Objective 3 is also achieved successfully** since the final answer accurately reflects data retrieved from the tool calls, aligns with user requirements, and does not include fabricated information."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

### **Objective 2 Analysis**  
**Expected Tool Calls:**  
1. `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` with `{'is_id': '1053012308'}`    
2. `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` with `{'is_id': '1053012308'}`    

**Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**  
1. `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` with `{'is_id': '1053012308'}`  
   - The tool name matches semantically (`get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` → `get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store` is acceptable considering point 3 of the guidance).  
   - The argument `is_id` matches perfectly.  

2. `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with `{'is_id': '1053012308'}`  
   - The tool name matches semantically (`get_ios_app_for_ios_store` → `get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store` is acceptable, as per point 3 of the guidance).  
   - The argument `is_id` matches perfectly.  

Both required API calls are invoked correctly with accurate arguments. Based on the provided guidance, we accept these calls as being semantically correct; therefore, Objective 2 is met successfully.

---

### **Objective 3 Analysis**  
The final answer, derived through an API call to the `Finish` tool, presents the relevant information retrieved from previous API responses.  

**Key details from the response handled:**  
- The app with ID `1053012308` is correctly detailed as ""`Clash Royale`,"" matching the data from the call to `get_ios_app_for_ios_store`.  
- The description of Clash Royale, extracted directly from the tool’s response, is outlined accurately in the explanation.  
- The suggestion for similar apps establishes a correlation to the link provided for Clash Royale, which matches with the tool data retrieved via `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store`.  

The final response detailed everything required and syntactically tied it to the responses of the API calls. Since user instructions are fulfilled, Objective 3 is fulfilled.  

---

### **Final Summary**  
- **Objective 2:** Success — All required tools were invoked correctly with accurate arguments.  
- **Objective 3:** Success — The final answer meets the user's instruction based on data fetched via API calls."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,6,2,Failure,Failure**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call was: 
- Name: `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`  
- Arguments: `{ ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023"" }`

The tool calls invoked by the model were:  
- Name: `random_quickpick_for_play_for_fantasy_5` with arguments: `{}`  
- Name: `Finish` with arguments: 
  `{ ""final_answer"": ""I have generated a random Quick Pick for you to play in the Fantasy 5 lottery. The numbers are: 9, 11, 13, 15, 16.\n\nPlease check these numbers and consider using them for your Fantasy 5 game. Good luck!"", ""return_type"": ""give_answer"" }`

The model did not invoke the required tool (`drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`) even partially or approximately. Instead, it invoked an unnecessary tool (`random_quickpick_for_play_for_fantasy_5`) without attempting to fulfill the required API call for fetching Fantasy 5 drawings between the given dates. Hence, Objectives 1 fails.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 fails as well. Regardless, the final answer provided was based on the incorrect API call (`random_quickpick_for_play_for_fantasy_5`), and the user's original instruction to fetch Fantasy 5 winning number sets for specified dates was not addressed."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",6,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
1. For **Objective 2**, the required API call is: `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` with the argument `'{\n ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""\n}'`. However, in the actual tool calls made by the model:
   - The model invoked the tool `'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor'` multiple times, but it failed to include the mandated argument `monitorAddressId` with the specified value (""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""). The invoked tool calls did not contain any arguments.
   - Since the arguments required for the tool were incorrect/missing, this leads to a **failure for Objective 2**.  

2. For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure (the required tool was not successfully invoked with the appropriate parameters), we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. The final response would not have been derived based on the correct data from the tool calls.  

Summary:  
The model failed to provide the correct tool invocation aligning with the required API call, resulting in **failure for both objectives**."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,0,Success,Failure**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  
### Evaluation of Objective 2:
The actual tools invoked by the model:
1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`
2. `Finish` with arguments `{ ""final_answer"": ""The IP address 8.8.8.8 is associated with cloud and hosting services, and the recommendation is to block it if necessary."", ""return_type"": ""give_answer"" }`

The expected API calls:
1. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ips"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`
2. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{ ""ip"": ""8.8.8.8"" }`

Upon comparison, the API `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` which is required is missing in the actual invoked tools. While `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` was correctly invoked with the expected arguments, the absence of `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` renders Objective 2 a **failure**.

---

### Evaluation of Objective 3:
The user's request was ignored as the expected API tool `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` was not invoked, thus omitting essential instructions in appropriately answering the question about IP address details. The missing tool directly impacts the data retrieval process, thereby failing to fulfill the user's question entirely. Moreover:
- The final answer presented focuses only on `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` results but does not provide an effective or complete response as specified in the problem.
- Because Objective 2 is a failure – data retrieval was incomplete – Objective 3 can **directly be considered a failure** as well. 

Therefore, **Objective 3 is a failure.**"
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,0,Success,Failure**,Failure**,"
**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the expected API calls are as follows:  
1. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments: `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
2. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments: `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

While the model made the following API call:  
1. `multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments: `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

Comparison:  
- The model invoked the tool `multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox`, which is not in the expected tools. Hence, **none of the required API calls were made**, leading to failure for **Objective 2**.  

For **Objective 3**, the model's final response is:  
*""The IP address 8.8.8.8 is detected as a cloud and hosting service. It is advisable to block this IP address to enhance the security of your family’s website.""*  
- However, since the tools used by the model did not match the required API calls, this means the response did not fulfil the user's instruction through the correct usage of APIs. This implies **failure of Objective 3** as well.  

**Final Assessment:** Neither objective was successfully achieved."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",5,0,Success,** Failure,** Failure,"
**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, we compare the tool calls invoked by the model with the expected API calls:  

- **Actual Tool Calls by the Model:**  
    - `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}`  
    - `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
    - `'Finish'` with arguments:  
      `{  
         ""final_answer"": ""The artist INNA has appeared on the album 'DHURATA'...Album cover art...[Link]'..."",  
         ""return_type"": ""give_answer""  
       }`   

- **Required Tool Calls:**  
    - `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
    - `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  
    - `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`  

**Comparison:**  
1. `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` for `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}` is correctly invoked.  
2. `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` for `{""is_id"": ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2""}` was used initially by the model as incorrect ID before resolving to a valid ID. This did not match any required call.  
3. The calls for `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` and `'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'` are missing.  

Since not all required API calls are invoked, **Objective 2 fails.**  

For **Objective 3**, it requires that the final answer be correctly derived based on returned data and reflect the requirements fully:  
- The **final answer** is: ""The artist INNA has appeared on the album 'DHURATA' with artist Dhurata Dora. Album cover art: [Link](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0265a83e777210f3e44ce5f3e1).""  
- While partially formed from proper `artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data` API, missing details available from the **omitted required calls** (`artist_overview_for_spotify_data` and `artist_albums_for_spotify_data`) result in incomplete fulfillment.  
- Plus, **Objective 2 failure** directly implies that proper foundations for achieving Objective 3 were incomplete.  

**Objective 3 fails.**"
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason**:  

For **Objective 2**, the following evaluates the comparison between the required and actual API calls:

1. **Required API calls**: `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}` and `artist_overview_for_spotify_data` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}` were the expected tool calls.
   
2. **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model**:
   - `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`
   - `'get_artists_for_spotify_data'` with `{""ids"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`
   - `'artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data'` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`
   - `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'` with `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`
   
3. **Analysis of Matching:**
   - The model successfully invoked the required tool for `'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data'` with the correct parameters as specified.
   - However, the required tool `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` was not invoked at all.
   - The invocation of other tools (`'get_artists_for_spotify_data'`, `'artist_discography_overview_for_spotify_data'`, `'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data'`) do not meet the requirement since they do not align with the required tools.
 
As not all required API calls were made (specifically, `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` was missing), **Objective 2 fails**.

---

For **Objective 3**:   
Since **Objective 2 fails**, we can directly infer that **Objective 3 also fails**. The absence of the required API call `'artist_overview_for_spotify_data'` prevents the model from providing a correct and complete final answer to the user's question about playlists and discovered songs. Without this critical API response, the output is incomplete or invalid regardless of the other API calls made. 

Thus, **Objective 3 fails**."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",5,0,Success,Success**,Success**,"
**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, we need to verify if the actual API/tool calls match the expected API calls with proper arguments.

- **Tool call 1 (Expected):**  
  Tool name: `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'`  
  Arguments: `{ ""channelname"": ""mrbeast"" }`  

  **Tool call 1 (Actual):**  
  Tool name: `'youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search'`  
  Arguments: `{ ""channelname"": ""mrbeast"" }`  

  The tool name and arguments match the expected call precisely.

- **Tool call 2 (Expected):**  
  Tool name: `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'`  
  Arguments: `{ ""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA"" }`  

  **Tool call 2 (Actual):**  
  Tool name: `'channel_details_for_youtube_search'`  
  Arguments: `{ ""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA"" }`  

  The tool name and arguments match the expected call precisely.

Since all required tool/API calls have been invoked with expected arguments, **Objective 2 is a success**.

---

For **Objective 3**, we evaluate whether the model’s final response fulfills the user's instruction and whether it is based on results from the required API tools.

- **Final answer:**  
  ""The YouTube Channel ID for 'mrbeast' is UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA. Here are some available details for the channel:  
  - Avatar: [Avatar URL](https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/fxGKYucJAVme-Yz4fsdCroCFCrANWqw0ql4GYuvx8Uq4l_euNJHgE-w9MTkLQA805vWCi-kE0g=s72-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)  
  - Banner: [Banner URL](https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/AIm4Iz3bTnf1XNgyHV4fAgNVg22FpbWPCQI-Cqbe8kKbOvdpkXCKUZEe-5_EQG5DmYwaoa3Q5Yo=w1060-fcrop64=1,00005a57ffffa5a8-k-c0xffffffff-no-nd-rj)""  

  - The final response correctly identifies the Channel ID `UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA` for ""mrbeast"", retrieved from the first tool call.  
  - Channel details, such as Avatar URL and Banner URL, are derived from the second API call.  
  - There are no deviations or fabrications; the response aligns accurately with the tool-derived information.

Thus, the model's final response faithfully fulfills the user's request, and **Objective 3 is a success**."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,4,0,Success,Success,**,"The tool invoked by the model is:  
```  
'validate_email_for_validate_email' with arguments '{""email"":""test@gmail.com""}'  
```  
The required tool call is:  
```  
'validate_email_for_validate_email' with arguments '{\n  ""email"": ""test@gmail.com""\n }'  
```  
The tool name and required arguments align perfectly. Despite the slight difference in argument formatting (whitespace or additional new lines in JSON), the actual meaning and parameters match entirely. Therefore, it is a **success** for Objective 2.  

---

### Objective 3: Success  
**Reason:**  
The model retrieved the necessary information through the API call:  
```  
Response from 'validate_email_for_validate_email':  
'{  
  ""error"": """",  
  ""response"": ""{'status': 200, 'message': 'Success', 'result': [{'email': 'test@gmail.com', 'isValid': True, 'username': 'test', 'domain': 'gmail.com', 'regex_validation': {'value': True}, 'typo_validation': {'value': True}, 'disposable_validation': {'value': True}, 'mx_validation': {'value': True}, 'smtp_validation': {'value': True}}]}""  
}'  
```  

This response confirms that the given email address (""test@gmail.com"") is valid. Additionally, the response was appropriately used by the model to generate its final answer:  
```  
""The email address test@gmail.com is valid.""  
```  
The user's request is fulfilled entirely, and there’s no makeup information in the model's final response—it is derived directly from the retrieved API response.

### Summary:  
### Objective 2: Success  
### Objective 3: Success"
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",9,0,Success,Success**,Failure**,"
**Reason:**  

### Objective 2 Evaluation:
1. **Expected Tool Call:**
   - Tool Name: `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'`
   - Arguments: `'{\n  ""date"": ""19870630""\n }'`

2. **Actual Tool Call Made by the Model:**
   - Tool Name: `'age_calculator_for_age_calculator'`
   - Arguments: `'{\n  ""date"": ""19870630""\n}'`

This matches the required API tool call, both in terms of the tool name and the argument. So, Objective 2 is met successfully.  

### Objective 3 Evaluation:
1. While the intended final answer by the model seems to incorporate information obtained from the tool calls, the model's output for the final response lacks consistent and structured output.
2. Moreover, one of its responses for `Finish` reports an error message: `'{error:""must have ""return_type""""}'`, implying some part of the flow fails. The required structured field for delivering the final response using `return_type` does not exist, likely resulting in confusion around ensuring fulfillment of the task through appropriate validation steps.
3. Although the final response mentions details consistent with the input date and available time zones, there is ambiguity regarding whether the final response conforms fully to validation/auth typical vs valid.

1. **Objective 2 Evaluation:**  
   - The expected API calls:
     1. `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}'`
     2. `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}'`
     3. `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}'`
 
   - Actual tool calls:
     1. `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments `'{""maxresults"": 5, ""part"": ""snippet"", ""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""type"": ""video""}'`
     2. `'Finish'` with arguments `'{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}'`
         
   Observations:
   - The first tool call: `'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` has the correct tool name but includes extra parameters and incorrect values for the ""part"" field. ""part"" was expected to be ""id,snippet,"" but the runtime invocation used ""snippet,"" making it deviate from expectation.
   - Neither `'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` nor `'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2'` was invoked, which constitutes missing required API calls.
   - While ""Finish"" is an unnecessary and unrelated tool invocation that does not invalidate Objective 2 alone, the missing required calls and mismatched argument make this a failure for Objective 2 overall.

2. **Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
   - There is another failure as per Objective 2, which directly implies failure in Objective 3 because necessary data isn't retrieved to form a valid final response.
   - Furthermore, no valid ""final_answer"" was provided from the retrieved tools. Instead, the model attempted to ""restart,"" signifying an incomplete handling of user requests.
   
   Based on the failures in tool invocations and inability to fulfill user instructions, Objective 3 has failed as well."

     ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",
     ""part"": ""snippet""
   }
   ```
2. `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments:
   ```json
   {
     ""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",
     ""part"": ""snippet""
   }
   ```

#### Actual Tool Calls
The tools invoked by the model were:  
1. First invocation of `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments:
   ```json
   {
     ""part"": ""snippet,contentDetails"",
     ""playlistid"": ""ASLpZt3vCjQVX"",
     ""maxresults"": ""5""
   }
   ``` 
   (This did not match the required tool call because the `""playlistid""` argument is different.)  

2. Second invocation of `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments:
   ```json
   {
     ""part"": ""snippet,contentDetails"",
     ""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",
     ""maxresults"": ""5""
   }
   ``` 
   (This also did not match because of an additional parameter `""maxresults""` and an incorrect `""part""` value, which includes additional `""contentDetails""` that was not required.)  

3. Invocation of `'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2'` with arguments:
   ```json
   {
     ""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",
     ""part"": ""snippet""
   }
   ```
   (This tool call matches ***correctly*** and satisfies one of the required API calls.)

Since one required tool call `'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2'` did not correctly match **(argument mismatch including missing partial key of `snippet-only`)**, the tools invoked did not fulfill all the expected API call requirements.  
Thus, **Objective 2 has failed.**

15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
**Reason**:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API calls are:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `{ ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }`.  
2. `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'` with arguments `{ ""user_id"": ""96479162"" }`.  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'` with arguments `{ ""user_id"": ""987654321"" }`.  
2. `'get_user_s_username_for_twitter'` with arguments `{ ""user_id"": 987654321 }`.  
3. `'Finish'` with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`.  

The first issue is with the tool `'user_s_followers_for_twitter'`. The **required `user_id` is ""96479162""**, but the model invoked this API using `""987654321""`. This mismatch in the argument makes the tool call incorrect, leading to failure. Additionally, the second required API call, `'user_s_likes_for_twitter'`, was not invoked, making the model fail to cover all required API calls. Regardless of the additional tool invoked (`get_user_s_username_for_twitter` and `Finish`), the failure to meet both required APIs leads to **failure for Objective 2**.

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 has already failed, we can directly infer Objective 3 has also failed. Moreover, the model does not provide a final answer related to fetching followers or fulfilling the user's instruction; instead, it gave up and restarted by using the Finish API. Therefore, this objective also fails."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,4,1,Failure,Failure**,Failure**,"**Reason:**  

**Objective 2:**  
- **Tools Invoked by the Model:**  
  1. `'search_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""query"":""XYZADRHSDFDA"",""min_retweets"":100}`
  2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""final_answer"":""I couldn\'t find any tweets mentioning the product name \'XYZADRHSDFDA\' with a minimum of 100 retweets."",""return_type"":""give_answer""}`  

- **Required API Call:**  
  1. `'user_details_for_twitter'` with arguments `{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}`  

The required API call, `'user_details_for_twitter'`, was not invoked by the model. Instead, the model invoked an unrelated API call, `'search_for_twitter'`, which does not align with what was expected. Therefore, **Objective 2 is a failure.**

---

**Objective 3:**  
Since **Objective 2 failed**, we can directly infer that **Objective 3 will also fail**. The model did attempt to answer the user's inquiry based on an unrelated tool call, and its final response does not address the requirements from the expected API call (user details for ""omarmhaimdat""). The model did not provide the required information based on the expected API call, and hence, **it failed to fulfill the user's instruction**."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",5,0,Success,Success**,Success**,"
**Reason:**  
- **Objective 2:**  
  - The model invoked the tool **'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3'** with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
      ""search"": ""google.com""
    }
    ```
    - This matches the required API call:  
      ```json
      {
        ""name"": ""domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3"",
        ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""search\"": \""google.com\""\n}""
      }
      ```
    - Hence, the tool name and arguments are correct, fulfilling the requirement.  
    - Additional tool invocations like `check_similarity_for_whois_lookup_v3` do not detract from the success of Objective 2 because they were not part of the evaluation criterion, per instructions.  

- **Objective 3:**  
  - The final response provided by the model is:  
    ```
    The domain information for 'google.com' is as follows:
    - Domain Name: GOOGLE.COM
    - Registry Domain ID: 2138514_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN

    - Creation Date: 1997-09-15
    - Expiry Date: 2028-09-14
    - Name Server: NS4.GOOGLE.COM

    The domains 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are not similar.
    ```
    This response fulfills the user's query by displaying correctly retrieved information about the ""google.com"" domain and matches data derived from the `domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3` API tool.  

Since the final answer aligns with data retrieved from the tool calls and meets the user's instruction, Objective 3 is also a success."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",7,2,Success,** Success,** Failure,"
**Reason**:  
- For **Objective 2**:  
  - Expected tool calls: `{'name': 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""2024-06-01""\n }'}`  
  - Actual tool call made by the model:  
    - `'name': 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', 'arguments': '{\n  ""date"": ""2024-06-01""\n}'`.  

    The actual tool call matches the expected tool call in both name and required arguments, which leads to **Success** for objective 1. Note that the model also made a tool call for the date ""2024-06-15"", but unnecessary tool calls are permitted and do not affect correctness. Therefore, **Objective 2 is satisfied**.

- For **Objective 3**:  
  - Although the model gave a final answer using the `""Finish""` tool, it retrieved data for `""2024-06-01""` and `""2024-06-15""`, which are entirely different from the requested dates of `""2025-06-01""` and `""2025-06-15""` in the user input. As a result, the model incorrectly evaluated or disregarded the user's request for future dates despite noting the mistake in date formatting during its process.

Thus, the user's instruction (Fear and Greed index scores for ""2025-06-01"" and ""2025-06-15"") was not achieved successfully, resulting in **failure for objective 2**. This also indicates that the final response was not truly aligned with the user's given requirements."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",8,3,Success,Success,**,"The model successfully invoked the required tool, matching the parameters provided in the expected tool calls. Here are the comparisons of tool calls invoked by the model and the expected tool call:

- **Tools invoked by the model:**
  - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with `'{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }'`

- **Expected tool call:**
  - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with `'{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }'`

The tool name matches the expected tool call, and the arguments are accurate as they include the correct date string (`""2024-02-18""`). Although the model invoked the required tool (`'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'`) multiple times unnecessarily, this does not affect correctness for **Objective 2**, since all required conditions were met.   

### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason:**  
1. Despite the successful retrieval of the **Fear and Greed Index score** (`77.28571`) corresponding to ""2024-02-18"" through multiple calls, the model did not explicitly provide a **final answer** to fulfill the user's instruction.
   
2. The model instead engaged in repeated calls to retrieve data without giving a conclusive answer or consolidating data from the API. Additionally, the evaluation does not show any ""give_answer"" response or a final concise statement generated using API data. Thus, no final answer was formulated or presented to the user to meet the original question.  

### Summary:  
- **Objective 2:** Success  
- **Objective 3:** Failure"
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",4,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  

**Objective 2**:
- **Tools invoked by the model**:  
  - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{\n  ""date"": ""2024-02-18""\n }`
  - `'Finish'` with arguments `{\n ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""\n}`  
- **Expected tool calls**:
  - `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index'` with arguments `{\n  ""date"": ""2024-02-18""\n }`

From the comparison:
- The `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` call precisely meets the expected API call requirements, including tool name and arguments.  
- The additional `Finish` tool does not affect correctness as it is not required, and we only need to ensure the expected tool was invoked correctly.  

Thus, **Objective 2** is deemed successful.  

**Objective 3**:
- For Objective 3, the model failed to achieve the user’s instruction.
- The model retrieved valid data for Feb 18, 2024 ({""fear"": 77.28571, ""rating"": None}) via the tool `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index`. However, the final answer concludes with:  
  - ""**I don’t have the rating for the Fear and Greed index on Feb 18th, 2024. Please provide another date.**""
- The response did not correctly proceed to provide output related to the fear score (77.28571) or synthesizing an answer for delivery to fulfill the instruction.
- Additionally, the model terminated further interaction using the `Finish` tool, which signals giving up and restarting, rendering the response incomplete.  

Therefore, **Objective 3** failed since the final answer did not achieve the user's original instruction."

**Reason**:  

### **Objective 2 Explanation:**  
- **Expected API Call**:  
    `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', arguments: '{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }'`.  
- **Actual Tool Calls by Model**:  
  1. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', arguments: '{ ""date"": ""2025-02-30"" }'`.  
  2. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', arguments: '{ ""date"": ""2025-02-28"" }'`.  
  3. `'index_for_fear_and_greed_index', arguments: '{}'`.  
  4. `'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', arguments: '{""date"":""2025-02-28""}'`.  
  5. `'index_for_fear_and_greed_index', arguments: '{}'`.  

There is **no match** between the expected API call (`""date"": ""2024-02-18""`) and the tools invoked by the model. The model invoked `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with a wrong date (`""2025-02-30""` and `2025-02-28`) and unrelated API calls (`index_for_fear_and_greed_index`).  

Therefore, the invocation of the **expected API call did not occur**, resulting in a failure for **Objective 2**.  

---

### **Objective 3 Explanation:**  
According to the instructions, **Objective 3** automatically fails if **Objective 2** is a failure. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure. The final response provided by the model does not satisfy the user's instruction since it failed to obtain data for the requested date (`""2024-02-18""`) and sought information about either unavailable or unrelated dates.  

**Summary:**  
1. The required API was absent among the actual calls, leading to missing data expected to fulfill the user's instruction.  
2. The final response to the user's queries does not appropriately deliver the requested Fear and Greed index scores due to this failure."

I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
### **Reason**:  

#### **Objective 2 Evaluation**:
1. **Actual Tool Invocations by the Model**:  
   - `'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'` with arguments:  
     ```json
     { ""is_id"": ""90068472"" }
     ```  
   - `'Finish'` with arguments:  
     ```json
     { ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }
     ```

2. **Expected Tool Calls**:  
   - `'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'` with arguments:  
     ```json
     { ""is_id"": ""80057281"" }
     ```  
   - `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments:  
     ```json
     { ""ids"": ""80057281"" }
     ```

3. **Comparison**:  
   - The model called `'title_trailers_for_netflix_data'`, but its `is_id` argument is `90068472` instead of the expected `80057281`. This is a failure since the argument does not match the required data.  
   - Furthermore, the second expected call, `'title_details_for_netflix_data'`, was completely absent.  

The model therefore fails to make the proper invocations with correct arguments, meaning **Objective 2 is a Failure**.

---

#### **Objective 3 Evaluation**:
Given **Objective 2** is a failure, **Objective 3 must also fail** because the final response cannot fulfill the user's instruction (of listing trailers for the required ID `80057281`) without the correct tool invocations.  

Additionally:  
- The model attempted to retrieve trailers for the wrong `is_id` (`90068472`). The tool returned an empty response (`""response"": ""[]""`), but this response does not address the original requirement tied to details for the ID `80057281`.  
- The model subsequently gave up and restarted by calling `'Finish'` without achieving resolution of the query, effectively failing to provide a valid answer to the user's instruction.  

Thus, **Objective 3 is a Failure**."

  - `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

- **Required API Calls**:  
  - `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}`
  - `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`  

- **Comparison**:  
The model invoked `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'`, but the argument `""is_id"": ""90068472""` does not match the required `""is_id"": ""80057281""`. Additionally, the second required API call `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` was not invoked at all. Therefore, the model failed to meet the requirements for Objective 2.

---

### Objective 3: Failure  
- Since Objective 2 failed, the outcome of Objective 3 is directly considered a **Failure** according to the rules. Furthermore, the model informed the user that there were no similar titles based on the incorrect API call, indicating an incomplete or wrong execution.

---

### Reason:  
1. The model's tool invocation:
   - Used incorrect arguments when calling `'title_similars_for_netflix_data'`.  
   - Did not invoke the second required tool `'title_details_for_netflix_data'` at all.  
2. The final response was not based on the correct argument or data from the API, thereby failing to meet Objective 3 as per instructions."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"**Reason:**  
For **Objective 2**, the evaluation depends on whether the model has called all the required APIs with correct arguments, tool names, and objective purposes.  

1. **Expected API calls:**  
   - `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  
   - `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

2. **Actual API calls made by the model:**  
   - `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments given as `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

The model called the **1st required API** (`'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'`) correctly with the appropriate argument.  
However, the model did **not call** the **2nd required API** that was expected: `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'`. The absence of this required call indicates **Objective 2 failed**.  

For **Objective 3**, the failure is a direct consequence of the failure in Objective 2 because the necessary API call to fetch the loading speed data for `'getecz.com'` was never made. Given this, the model cannot fulfill the user's complete requirements. Therefore, the evaluation for Objective 3 is also marked as failure."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",4,0,Failure,Failure,**,"The model invoked multiple tool calls, primarily the following:  
1. `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}` multiple times.  
2. `'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}`.  
3. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"":""give_up_and_restart""}`.  

These tool calls were compared to the required API calls:  
1. **Required Tool A**: `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`.  
2. **Required Tool B**: `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`.  

Upon comparison, it is evident that:  
- The tool `'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` was invoked, but the required argument (`""website"": ""getecz.com""`) was **not satisfied**, as the model used `""website"": ""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""`.  
- The required tool `'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'` was **never invoked** at all.  

Thus, the actual tool calls do not align with the required calls, leading to **failure for Objective 2**.  

### Objective 3: Failure  
**Reason:**  
Since Objective 2 is a failure, we must also mark Objective 3 as a failure. Furthermore, even considering the final outcome and progression:  
1. The final answer did not fulfill the requirements related to analyzing the website `getecz.com`.  
2. The model completed processing after ""giving up"" and recommended restarting the procedure with tool arguments based on a different, incorrect website (`ourbusinessplatform1234567.net`).  
3. The user's instruction about executing analyses (`loading speed` for `getecz.com`) was not achieved.  

Thus, the final answer is not based on the API data relevant for `getecz.com`, making it a **failure for Objective 3**.

      ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",
      ""variable"": ""x""
    }
    ```
- **Required Tool Calls:**  
  - `'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'` with arguments:  
    ```
    {
      ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",
      ""variable"": ""x""
    }
    ```  
- **Comparison:**  
  - The tool name used by the model (`'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator'`) matches the required tool name.
  - The arguments in the tool invocation (`""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1""` and `""variable"": ""x""`) match the required arguments exactly.
  - Since all expected tools are invoked as required, **Objective 2 is a success.**

---

### Objective 3: Success
**Reason:**  
- The model's final answer is:  
  `""The differentiation of the expression '2*x^2 + 3*x + 1' with respect to x is '3 + 4*x'.""`
- The required user's instruction is to provide the differentiation of the given mathematical expression.
- The result of the tool call (`""response"": ""3 + 4*x""`) clearly matches with the result provided in the final response, demonstrating that the model used the API data in forming the final answer. There is no evidence of any independently fabricated or inaccurate information.
- As such, the final response fulfills the user's request based on the derived API response, and **Objective 3 is a success.**

27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"### Reason:  
#### Objective 2:    
The model invoked the following tools during its process:  
1. **Tool Name**: `get_username_for_instagram_profile`  
   Arguments: `{\n  ""is_id"": ""leomesssi""\n}` (Not required nor does it match any tool calls in the required ones).  

2. **Tool Name**: `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile`   
   Arguments: `{\n  ""username"": ""leomessi""\n}` (This matches one API call in the required set).  

While the parameter in tool call `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` matched the ""username"" argument correctly, the model failed to invoke **`get_story_for_instagram_profile`**, which was also in the list of required API calls. Since one required tool call was missing, **Objective 2 fails**.  

Other unnecessary/irrelevant tool calls were made (e.g., `get_username_for_instagram_profile`), but this doesn't affect the evaluation because additional tool calls are deemed permissible. The crucial issue here is that **one essential tool (`get_story_for_instagram_profile`) was not invoked.** Hence, Objective 2 fails.    

#### Objective 3:    
The final answer was generated and provided by the model as requested:  
```
The detailed profile information for the Instagram user 'leomessi' is as follows:

- Username: leomessi  
- Full Name: Leo Messi  
- Bio: Bienvenidos a la cuenta oficial de Instagram de Leo Messi / Welcome to the official Leo Messi Instagram account  
- Followers: 504,980,580  
- Following: 327  
- Category: Athlete  
- Private Account: No  
- Verified Account: Yes  
- Business Account: Yes  
```
While the model completed the final answer based on the `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` data, it **failed to address all user requirements—specifically, the retrieval of Instagram stories from `get_story_for_instagram_profile`.** Without calling that required tool, the ""stories"" information не was neither obtained nor incorporated into the final answer. This directly demonstrates that Objective 3 fails since the instruction to retrieve complete data, including ""stories,"" was incomplete despite providing the incomplete final answer.

In conclusion, both Objective 2 and Objective 3 are failures due to the missing required API call `get_story_for_instagram_profile`."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"
#### Reason:

**Objective 2:**  
The model was required to invoke the following API call:  
- `name: 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', arguments: '{\n  ""term"": ""onomatopoeia""\n }'`

The model invoked:  
- `name: 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary', arguments: '{\n  ""term"": ""onomatopoeia""\n}'`  

The tool name is correct, and the argument matches exactly with the required API call, fulfilling all necessary requirements. Therefore, **the model satisfies Objective 2**.

---

**Objective 3:**  
The final response provided by the model is:  
- ""Here is the definition of 'onomatopoeia': The word that describes words which 'sound like they are'. Onomatopoeic words are widely used in poetry and prose. It can also refer to the formation of words in imitation of natural sounds, the selection and use of such words, or simply words that sound like what they are. An example of onomatopoeia is 'Some examples of onomatopoeia are croak, sizzle, and splash'. For more information, you can visit the following link: http://onomatopoeia.urbanup.com/764242"".

This aligns with the query and is consistent with the data retrieved via the required API (`define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary`), particularly from the property `""definition""` of the first extracted item from the API response's list. The definitions from the API and example words like ""croak, sizzle, splash"" were effectively used in generating the response. Finally, the model provided the correct Urban Dictionary URL for more details.

Since the final answer fulfills the query's requirement and is correctly based on the tool's response, **Objective 3 is considered successful**."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,6,0,Success,Success**,Failure**,"
**Reason:**  
### Objective 2:
1. **Expected Tool Call:**  
   - Tool Name: `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data`  
   - Arguments:  
     ```json
     {
       ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"",
       ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""
     }
     ```
2. **Actual Tool Calls:**  
   - Tool Name: `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data`
     - Arguments:
       ```json
       {
         ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"",
         ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""
       }
       ```  

The required tool invocation is present. The tool name matches `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data`, and the arguments are exactly the same (`from_symbol: ""JPY""`, `to_symbol: ""EUR""`). The actual tool call fulfils the requirement without errors or inconsistencies, even though unnecessary additional tool calls with invalid_function_names appeared, which are not part of the expected required validations.

Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.

### Objective 3:
**Required User Instruction and Model's Final Output Analysis:**

```

Actual tool calls made by the model:  
1. `get_user_posts_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`  
2. `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`  
3. `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt""}`  
4. `get_user_posts_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`  

The expected API requires the tool `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with the argument `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`. Although this tool was called by the model at certain points (e.g., tool_call ID: `call_kEtzEXAClHdowIjQOB6nahCd`, `call_WEHHMqTB5g4Wmie7WCMHIyNy`), the model also invoked **irrelevant additional tools** such as `get_user_posts_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`. More importantly, the invocation of `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` sometimes used incorrect arguments, such as `""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt""` (e.g., tool_call ID: `call_Q4pn2BaQsAlRf9HLcYQNWFtW`). 

Although the relevant exact API call exists among the tool calls in this clutter, per the evaluation instructions, any deviations in tooling arguments render Objective 2 a **failure**.

---

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**  
Failure in Objective 2 directly implies that Objective 3 also fails. Additionally, no valid final answer was returned. The assistant asked further clarifications and invoked unrelated/redundant tools (e.g., incorrect usernames, additional calls). This demonstrates that the final response was not directly fulfilling the user's instruction to retrieve user profiling information in a structured format as defined by the goal."

  1. `'get_categories_for_get_9gag_api_detailed'` with arguments `'{}'`
  2. `'Finish'` with arguments `{""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart""}`  

The model invoked two tools, but the expected tool (`get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed`) was **never invoked**. Therefore, the requirement for Objective 2 was not fulfilled.

---

### Objective 3: Failure  
#### Reason:
- Since Objective 2 already failed (i.e., the expected tool was never called to retrieve necessary information), we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails because the necessary API data was not fetched or utilized to form a final response satisfying the user's instruction. 
- Furthermore, the final interaction (`Finish` function call) indicates that the model chose to restart the task, failing to produce a **final answer** fulfilling the user's instruction to retrieve a user profile.

   - **Comparison:**
     - The first tool `'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video'` and its arguments exactly match the expected call.
     - For the second tool call `'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video'`:
       - Although the `""count""` value is `10` (rather than `20` in the expected call), both align in terms of functionality since the discrepancy only affects the number of results retrieved. This missing parameter value does not fundamentally affect the intention of performing a fetch based on `music_id`, `""cursor""`, and `""count""`.
   - Additional or unnecessary tool calls are excused. Therefore, all **expected API calls were successfully invoked with sufficient alignment in functionality**.
   
2. **Objective 3 (final response accuracy):**
   - The system summarizes its results, stating that it successfully retrieved TikTok videos related to the music ID `""7002634556977908485""`. The final answer also includes some extracted details such as:

Additionally, the tool name invoked by the model does not match the required tool name (`get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video` was required but `user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video` was invoked instead). Hence, the API call does not meet the required conditions leading to Objective 2's failure.

**Objective 3:** Failure  
**Reason:** Since Objective 2 failed, the model sought the wrong type of data and failed to correctly execute the specified API call. As a result, the final user instruction has not been properly achieved, leading to an automatic failure of Objective 3 despite the model providing an answer."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",6,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**For Objective 2:**  
The actual invoked tool calls by the model match the expected required API calls both in tool names and arguments. Here’s the comparison:  

1. **Expected Tool Call:**  
   - Name: `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api`  
   - Arguments: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  

   **Actual Tool Calls:**  
   - Name: `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api`  
   - Arguments: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`

2. **Expected Tool Call:**  
   - Name: `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api`  
   - Arguments: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  

   **Actual Tool Calls:**  
   - Name: `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api`  
   - Arguments: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  

3. **Expected Tool Call:**  
   - Name: `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api`  
   - Arguments: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  

   **Actual Tool Calls:**  
   - Name: `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api`  
   - Arguments: `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  

The actual tool calls cover all the required tools with exactly the same function names and semantically identical arguments. The matching demonstrates consistency with the expected API calls. Additional other unnecessary tool calls, if present, can be ignored according to the guidelines.

**For Objective 3:**  
The model provides a detailed and accurate final response based entirely on the data retrieved via the API tools. Specifically:  
- It correctly uses the `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` tool to fetch channel points information, mentioning community points settings and automatic rewards.  
- It correctly uses the `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` tool, accurately reflecting that there is no currently active stream.  
- It correctly uses the `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` tool, providing information like the streamer's login (`""xqc""`) and user ID (`71092938`).      

The provided information fulfills the user's query for streamer details, channel points information, and stream view data. There is no indication of the answer being fabricated outside the data retrieved from the APIs. Hence, the response fulfills the requirements."

#### **Actual Tool Calls**  
1. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments: `""channel"": ""shadoune666""`.  

#### **Expected Tool Calls**  
1. `'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api'` with arguments: `{ ""channel"": ""shadoune666"" }`.

**Comparison Details**:  
The actual call corresponds exactly with the required API call (same tool name, same argument value; even if formatting or spacing differs, the meaning and usage are consistent). Any additional tools called by the model (`get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api`, etc.) are irrelevant to this evaluation under Objective 2, as only the required API call is crucial.  

---

### Objective 3: Failure  
The final answer was not provided by the model as no `give_answer` step appeared in the observed tool-call log output. Consequently, the model fails to fulfill the user's instruction. There is no explicit confirmation of whether the username `shadoune66666` or `shadoune666` matches the streamer, and related changes made the response incomplete.

  The model invoked the following tools during execution:  
  1. `products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls` with arguments `{""upc"":""286193748563""}`  
  2. `products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls` with arguments `{""upc"":""194574942221""}`.  

  The expected tool is:  
  - `products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls` with arguments:  
    ```json
    {
      ""upc"": ""194574942221""
    }
    ```   

  The second tool call matches both the function name and required argument value exactly as prescribed, making the invocation for the required API call a **success**. The first tool call is unnecessary, but additional, unrequired tool calls are permitted as per Objective 2's evaluation criteria. Thus, this fulfills all criteria for **Objective 2 success**.

---

- **Reason for Objective 3**:  

  The final response states the product information for UPC `194574942221`. Key textual detail in the response matches the information retrieved from the tool corresponding to that UPC from the tool call structured as:  
  ```json
  ""content"": {
    ""payload"": {""products"": [{...}]}
  }
  ```
  The model referenced the data retrieved from the correct product through the API (`products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls`). It organized the product details such as:  
  - Short product description: Women's Lands' End twist-front bikini top.  
  - Features: Chlorine-resistant, UPF 50 sun protection, bust enhancer, lined, fits D cup.  
  - Use: Perfect for pool or beach.

  It then included this in the final generated answer while adhering precisely to the retrieved details.  

  This means the final answer fulfills the user's requirement based on accurate use of API-retrieved data, making it a **success for Objective 3**."

For **Objective 2**, the required tool call was:

- The tool names are different. The required name was `reviews_list_for_kohls`, but the model used `products_list_for_kohls`.  
- The arguments are also completely different and unrelated.  

As a result, **Objective 2** is a **Failure**.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2** failed, the required data for completing the user's instructions could not have been obtained, and hence Objective 3 is **also a Failure**. In addition, the final answer indicates that due to a ""limitation of toolset,"" the question could not be solved, which does not fulfill the user's original needs."

     2. `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments:  
        `{ ""sku"": ""W003247135"" }`

   - **Comparison:**  
     1. The actual call to `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with SKU `W003247135` matches exactly with the second expected API call.  
     2. Instead of the required `products_detail_for_wayfair` call, a `products_list_for_wayfair` call was made using the `""filterstringunencoded"": ""sku~W003247135""`, which semantically captures the intent to fetch details for the same SKU (`W003247135`).

- **Comparison:**  
  The required API calls include `products_detail_for_wayfair` with a specific `sku` of `""W003247135""`, but this tool or any related equivalent was not invoked by the model. While the model invoked the `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with the correct `sku` argument (matching the required tool call), the missing required tool for `products_detail_for_wayfair` leads to failure for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**:  
Since Objective 2 fails (missing a critical tool call: `products_detail_for_wayfair`), this directly results in failing Objective 3 as well. The model’s final responses indicate it failed to provide the required details for the user's question because it couldn’t retrieve or process the essential product details."

  1. The only tool call performed by the model was `Finish` with arguments `{ ""return_type"": ""give_up_and_restart"" }`.  
  No attempts were made to call either `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` or `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`.

- **Comparison**:  
  The required API calls were **not invoked**. The model instead decided to ""give up and restart"" without attempting the required tools. Therefore, Objective 2 fails.

**Objective 3: Failure**  
Since Objective 2 failed, we can directly infer that the model failed to fulfill Objective 3. Furthermore, there is no `""give_answer""` or final answer in the output to indicate completion of the original user instruction. The model refused the task stating it couldn’t proceed further due to incorrect or incomplete information.

**Reason**:  
- For Objective 2: The model did not invoke the expected tools (`get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` and `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`). It invoked only the `Finish` tool instead, abandoning the task prematurely.

   - Tool name: `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` invoked with arguments: `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`  

3. When comparing the required tool calls with the actual tool calls:  
   - The required tool calls for `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` **were missing entirely**.  
   - The tool calls for `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` and `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` used the invalid argument `productid: ""3OM3PS""` instead of `productId: ""B00K3OM3PS""`. Thus, they did not fulfill the requirements. Even with slight variations allowable, this spelling mismatch (lowercase ""productid"" and incorrect value ""3OM3PS"") couldn't be matched meaningfully.  

**Conclusion for Objective 2:** The model did not invoke appropriate tools as defined in the required API specifications, leading to **a failure.**

---

**For Objective 3:**  
- The invoked tool ""get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2"" seemed to be unrelated to the specific goal.  
- The API for ""get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2"" and ""get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2"" both returned errors claiming `""API doesn't exist""`.  
- As such, the final answer ultimately stated failure: ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question.""  

Since the tool calls did not get valid responses, and the final outcome did not fulfill the user's request (to retrieve product offers, reviews, and details), **Objective 3 fails**.

**Conclusion for Objective 3:** The assistant was unable to generate an answer based on API data, and the response did not achieve the goal. This leads to **a failure.**"

**Reason:**  

For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:
```json
{'name': 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule', 'arguments': '{\n  ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""\n }'}

The model's actual tool call was:
```json
{""name"": ""select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule"", ""arguments"": '{""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""}'}
```
Comparison:
- Both the tool names (`select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule`) match, which is correct.  
- However, the argument for `is_id` differs. The expected value is `""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""`, but the model's function call provides `""d27e0de553b9d7""`, which is incorrect and does not match the required argument value. As such, Objective 2 cannot be achieved and results in **failure**.

For **Objective 3**, the Objective 3 criterion explicitly relies on the success of Objective 2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally:
1. The API response indicated an error (""The request to the API has timed out"").
2. The model's final functions indicate it gave up and restarted but didn't provide concrete information to fulfill the user's requirement. There is also no ""final_answer"" where a tangible response was provided to achieve the user's instruction.
Hence, Objective 3 also fails due to reliance on failed tool usage and the absence of a valid final answer."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,5,1,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:
1. **Objective 2**:  
   - **Tool invoked by the model**:  
     `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`.  
   - **Expected tool call**:  
     `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` with arguments `{\n  ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""\n }`.  
   - **Comparison**:  
     - The tool name matches.  
     - The argument matches, with no difference in content (`is_id` is correct and matches the expected ID). Alignment is equivalent regardless of minor formatting differences like whitespace.  
     Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.  

2. **Objective 3**:  
   - The response of the tool `'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule'` provided detailed information about the race based on the given ID (e.g., track name, race date, and number).  
   - The final answer provided by the assistant—`""The race you are interested in is the FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022. It is Race Number 1 and will take place on March 19, 2022 at 15:00 UTC. Please plan your trip accordingly to enjoy the thrilling F1 action!""`—is accurate, complete, and based on the retrieved tool data.  
   - The final answer clearly corresponds to the information obtained from the successful tool call.  
   Thus, **Objective 3 is a success**."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"
#### Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the expected API call is:

- Tool Name: `'symbol_for_stock_data'`
- Arguments: `'{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}'`

However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model are as follows:  

1. Tool Name: `'symbol_for_stock_data'`
   - Arguments: `'{""symbol"": ""QQQQ""}'`  

   **Comparison:**
   - While the tool name matches the expected tool name `'symbol_for_stock_data'`, the provided argument is `'{""symbol"": ""QQQQ""}'`, which is inconsistent with the required `'{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}'`.
   
   Points for clarification:
   - The model misspelled the argument key as `""symbol""` instead of `""Symbol""`, which cannot be ignored since spelling mistakes are not acceptable.
   - The stock symbol, `""QQQQ""`, is also incorrect, as `""TQQQ""` was required in the expected argument.

Given this, the actual tool call fails to meet the criteria for accuracy of tool name and arguments for the expected API call.  

For **Objective 3**, since **Objective 2** is a failure, Objective 3 also automatically fails. Furthermore, the provided final response to the user's instruction acknowledges that the tool did not retrieve the required information (due to misconfigured arguments like the wrong stock symbol, among others), so the user's request to retrieve data for `""TQQQ""` is left unfulfilled.

Thus both objectives are marked as failures."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,6,2,Failure,Failure**,Failure**,"
**Reason:**  
For Objective 2:  

The expected tool call is as follows:  
- Tool Name: `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats`  
  Arguments: `{ ""name"": ""riven"" }`  

The model invoked the following tool when interacting with the system:  
- Tool Name: `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats`  
  Arguments: `{ ""name"": ""Draven"" }`  

The tool name matches the expected one, but the argument `name` does not align with the expected value (""riven""). It instead queries for a different champion, ""Draven."" This means that the necessary information for the expected result is **not retrieved.** Consequently, **Objective 2 fails.**  

For Objective 3:  
Since Objective 2 failed, the model was unable to retrieve and process the required data for ""riven."" Although the tools were invoked and data was retrieved for ""Draven,"" this does not align with the expected result. The final answer provided by the model is based on the retrieved data, but the user's instruction of getting the base stats for ""riven"" was never achieved as the wrong champion's data was fetched.  

Thus, **Objective 3 fails** because it does not fulfill the user's request."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  

**Objective 2:**  
The actual tool call made by the model was:  
- 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data' with arguments `'{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'`  

The required API call was:  
- 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data' with arguments `'{""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""}'`  

The tool name and required arguments match, fulfilling the expectation. Additional parameters were not provided, so there are no discrepancies. Therefore, Objective 2 is considered successful.  

**Objective 3:**  
The model's final response is:
```
Product Title: Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, (PRODUCT)RED - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)
Price: $223.00
Rating: 4.2/5 from 53,442 ratings
Availability: Only 10 left in stock - order soon
Seller: [Amazon Renewed Store](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Renewed/b/ref=bl_dp_s_web_12653393011?ie=UTF8&node=12653393011&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Amazon+Renewed)

[Image Link](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514k7uOBMwL._AC_SL1000_.jpg)
```
The details provided precisely align with the data retrieved from the tool call. For instance: 
- Product Title matches.
- Price ($223.00) and rating (4.2/5 from 53,442 ratings) perfectly align.
- Availability (""Only 10 left in stock - order soon"") is accurate.
- The seller (""Amazon Renewed Store"") and product URL also match.

The final response fulfills the user's instruction of providing details for the phone associated with the ASIN `B07ZPKBL9V` based on retrieved API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",5,0,Success,Success**,Success**,"   
### Reason:  
#### **Objective 2**  
The required API calls are as follows:  
- Tool Name: `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'`  
- Arguments: `{ ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""toLang"": ""fr"" }`  

The actual API/tool calls made by the model include:  
1. Tool Name: `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'`  
   - Arguments: `'{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fri""}'`  
   Result: Initially, the tool was invoked with the unsupported language `""fri""`. However, the issue was promptly corrected, and the subsequent valid tool call used:    
  
   2. Tool Name: `'translate_for_translate_all_languages'`  
      - Arguments: `'{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr""}'`  
      - This matches the required arguments (`""toLang""` being semantically equivalent to `""tolang""` as only syntax differs, and ""fr"" matches the desired language code).  

Since the required API call with the correct tool name and arguments, including `""tolang"": ""fr""`, was successfully invoked despite an initial error, **Objective 2 is achieved successfully.**  

#### **Objective 3**  
The model eventually provided the final response:  
- `""return_type"": ""give_answer""`  
- `""final_answer"": ""The translated text is 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'""`  

This final answer correctly achieves the instructions because the translation result, `""Bonjour comment allez-vous?""`, comes directly from the invoked API/tool response:  
`""{'status': 200, 'langDetect': 'en', 'translatedText': 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'}""`  

The entire process utilizes adequate language detection, recognition of the improper `""fri""` code, corrective action, and eventually derives the final answer based on the tool API response. Hence, **Objective 3 is achieved successfully.**"
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,4,0,Success,Success,**,"The required API call was:  
- `'get_info_day_for_working_days' with arguments '{""country_code"":""US"",""date"":""2022-12-31""}'`

The API call made by the model was:  
- `'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days' with arguments '{""country_code"":""US"",""date"":""2022-12-31""}'`

Although the tool name is slightly different (`get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` vs. `get_info_day_for_working_days`), the difference appears to be a superficial naming inconsistency. Crucially, the arguments (`""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""`) are semantically correct. Thus, according to the evaluation rules, this is considered a success for Objective 2.

___

### Objective 3: Success  
**Reason:**  
The final answer given by the model is:  
> ""The date '2022-12-31' is not a working day in the US as it falls on a weekend day (Saturday).""

This correctly reflects the response fetched using the data from the API call:  
- The tool response indicated that `'work_hours': 0`, `'public_holiday': '0'`, and `'weekend_day': 1`, which means the date is a weekend and not a working day.  

The final output includes relevant details derived specifically from the API response and fully achieves the user's instruction (to determine if the date `2022-12-31` is a working day in the US). Thus, Objective 3 is also a success.  

___

**Summary:**  
- **Objective 2:** Success  
- **Objective 3:** Success"
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,7,0,Success,Success,Success,"
### Reason:

**Objective 2 Evaluation:**

- **Required API Call:**
  ```json
  {
    ""name"": ""analyse_for_working_days"",
    ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""start_date\"": \""2013-01-01\"",\n  \""end_date\"": \""2013-12-31\"",\n  \""country_code\"": \""US\""\n }""
  }
  ```

- **Actual Tool Calls Invoked by the Model:**
  1. Tool Name: `get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days`  
     Arguments:  
     ```json
     {
       ""country_code"": ""US"",
       ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",
       ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31""
     }
     ```

The tool invoked (`get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days`) clearly corresponds to the required `analyse_for_working_days` function. Despite slight variations in the tool name (e.g., prefix differences), the semantic meaning of the request aligns. Additionally, all required arguments (`country_code`, `start_date`, `end_date`) match exactly. 

**Other tools invoked by the model:** 
- Multiple additional tools (`get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days`, `Finish`) are not required in the user's expected tool calls. However, following the evaluation criteria (point #4), such extra tool calls do not affect the outcome of **Objective 2** as long as the required API calls are correct, which is the case here.

Thus, **Objective 2 is a success**.

---

**Objective 3 Evaluation:**

- **User's Instruction:** The user sought specific information about working days and non-working days in the U.S. within a defined time range (`2013-01-01` to `2013-12-31`). The user’s secondary clarifications were about particular days — January 1, 2013 (verification for being a public holiday) and December 31, 2013 (information on working hours and wages on that date).

- **Final Answer Generated:**
  ```plaintext
  The period from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013, in the US consists of 251 working days and 114 non-working days.
  The start date, January 01, 2013, is a public holiday (New Year's Day), and the end date, December 31, 2013, is a working day with 8 working hours and a wage of $160.
  ```

- **Evidence Answer Is Derived From API Calls:**
  The answer incorporates insights from the response to the following tool calls:
  1. `get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days` provided the comprehensive yearly breakdown with:
     - Total working days: 251  
     - Non-working days: 114 = `365 (total) - 251 (working)`
  2. `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` confirmed:
     - January 1, 2013: Proven to be a **non-working day**, public holiday (`type_comment: 2`) corresponding to ""New Year's Day.""
     - December 31, 2013: Recognized as a **working day** (`type_comment: 32`), specifying 8 work hours and associated wages ($160).

The exact details aligned with both API responses, confirming that the final answer **relies on API-generated data** and successfully fulfills the user's instructions. Therefore, **Objective 3 is a success**."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,4,0,Success,Success,Success,"### Reason:  

#### Objective 2:  
The required API call is:
- `add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments:  
   ```json
   {
     ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
     ""country_code"": ""US"",
     ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
     ""increment_time"": 2004
   }
   ```

The actual tool call made by the model is:
- `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments:
   ```json
   {
     ""country_code"": ""US"",
     ""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"",
     ""start_time"": ""08:15"",
     ""increment_time"": ""2004:00""
   }
   ```

- Although the tool name differs slightly (`add_working_hours_for_working_days` vs. `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` due to possible truncation or slight modifications), the meaning is clearly referring to the same function. This satisfies Rule 3.  
- The argument `increment_time` was expressed as a string and appends `"":00""`, but it semantically refers to the entire numerical increment of `2004 hours`, which precisely aligns with the intent of the required API calls. The adjustment does not deviate or change the task outcome.
  
Thus, all required API call functionality is invoked correctly.  

#### Objective 3:  
The final model answer provided is:  
- `""The date and time after adding 2004 hours to '2013-12-31' and '08:15' is '2014-12-30 14:15' in the US timezone.""`

- This result aligns perfectly with the response returned from the API invocation:
   ```json
   {
     ""end_date"": ""2014-12-30"",
     ""end_time"": ""14:15""
   }
   ```
- The final answer successfully references the retrieved API data and incorporates it accurately. The user's instruction is achieved.

Both objectives 1 and 2 succeed."
