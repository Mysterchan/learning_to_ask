Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.working_days: The API returns the number of days,  hours, working days, working hours, wages, weekend days, and the list of public holidays of the requested date period and country. You can also add any number of working days or working hours to a given date. 50 countries and over 230 regional calendars are supported and we work hard to keep our database up to date by following government announcements regarding public holidays changes. All the calendars can be fully customized from our friendly working da...\n"
