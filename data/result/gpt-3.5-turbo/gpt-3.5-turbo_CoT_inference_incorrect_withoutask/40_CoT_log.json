Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.amazon_data_scraper_v2: Amazon Data Scraper is the easiest way to get access to products, price, sales and reviews data from amazon in JSON format\n"
