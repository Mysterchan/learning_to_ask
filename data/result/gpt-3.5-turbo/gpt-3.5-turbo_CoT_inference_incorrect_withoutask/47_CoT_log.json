Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.translate_all_languages: Translate All Language -  Text Translator100x cheaper than Google Translate. Same API. Same quality.  Translate All Languages provides a simple API for translating plain text between any of 100+ supported languages. If you don\u2019t know what language the text is written in, our API will detect the language of the original request.  telegram DM: https://t.me/justmobicode\n"
