Previous attempts to directly access geographic and city details using concrete names/results do not yield the needed data, particularly returning error responses like \"ENTITY_NOT_FOUND\" often seen from previous actions.\n2. There's no usable trajectory emerging from previous actions concerning parameter configurations, geographic references, or successfully modeling responses to extract effective outcomes.\n\nIn light of this, a more fundamental approach should be utilized. I can simply proceed without specific locational detail doubts but rather focusing on one action that is designed to take a broad and comprehensive approach amongst state contributors naively associated involved.\n\nThus, the modified actionable step will be to harness a straightforward request for the identification of states in North America where time zones fit succinctly per initial mention, mapping out existing variations concerning entries indicated and retrieving details being gathered efficiently. \n\nFirst, I will gather essential details about states distinct as Counter-starter.
