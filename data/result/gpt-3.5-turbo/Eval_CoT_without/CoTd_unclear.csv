10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with arguments '{""query"": ""\'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\'""}'. However, the model invoked 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with arguments '{""query"":""Star Wars""}'. The query parameters do not match, as the model searched for ""Star Wars"" instead of ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer based on the required API call, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the argument `{""date"":""2022-10-18""}`, but the required API call was `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the argument `{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}`. The date argument in the actual tool call does not match the required date, leading to a failure for Objective 2.
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model's final response indicated that it was unable to retrieve the scores for the specified date and also found no live matches happening today, which does not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve scores for the required date. The final answer was based on the incorrect date and the lack of data for today, not on the required API call."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,5,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool 'projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with the argument '{""season"":""2020""}', which matches the required API call. Additionally, the model invoked the same tool for seasons ""covid"", ""2021"", and ""2022"", which are not required but do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.
- For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer based on the 2022 season data, which does not match the required API call for the 2020 season. The final answer should have been based on the 2020 season data as specified in the required API call. Since the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction to provide the projected PGA rankings for the 2020 season, Objective 3 is a failure."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with the argument `{""tournament_id"": ""650""}`. However, the model invoked `leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data` with the argument `{""tournament_id"": 474}`. The argument `tournament_id` does not match the required value, so Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is about the ""Fortinet Championship"" (tournament_id: 474), which does not align with the required tournament_id (650). Therefore, the model's response is not based on the correct API data, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API call is:  
- Tool name: `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis`  
- Arguments: `{""timestamp"": ""2025-01-20"", ""n_players"": ""10"", ""category"": ""singles""}`  

The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
1. Tool name: `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis`  
   Arguments: `{""category"":""singles"",""n_players"":""10"",""timestamp"":""2023-10-16""}`  
2. Tool name: `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis`  
   Arguments: `{""category"":""singles"",""n_players"":""10"",""timestamp"":""2023-10-09""}`  
3. Tool name: `official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis`  
   Arguments: `{""category"":""singles"",""n_players"":""10"",""timestamp"":""2023-10-02""}`  

The required API call specifies a timestamp of `2025-01-20`, but the model invoked the tool with timestamps `2023-10-16`, `2023-10-09`, and `2023-10-02`. Since the timestamps do not match the required API call, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model does not align with the required timestamp (`2025-01-20`). The model's response is based on data from `2023-10-09`, which does not fulfill the user's instruction for the latest rankings as of `2025-01-20`. Thus, the response is not derived from the correct API data, and Objective 3 is also a failure."
15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis' twice with arguments '{""category"":""returnpointswon2ndserve"",""season"":""2012"",""surface"":""clay""}' and '{""category"":""returnpointswon1stserve"",""season"":""2012"",""surface"":""clay""}'. The required API call was 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis' with arguments '{""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay""}'. The model's tool calls do not match the required API call because the ""category"" arguments are different (""returnpointswon2ndserve"" and ""returnpointswon1stserve"" vs. ""return""). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the model's final response indicates that it couldn't retrieve the global statistics due to a validation issue with the specified category, which means the user's instruction was not achieved. The final answer was not based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as the API calls were not correctly executed."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{""base"": ""RMB"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`. However, the model invoked `exchange_for_currency_v2` with arguments `{""base"": ""CNY"", ""to"": ""GBP""}`. The argument `base` is incorrect as it should be `RMB` instead of `CNY`. Although `CNY` and `RMB` refer to the same currency, the argument must match exactly as specified in the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the incorrect API call, which further confirms the failure of Objective 3. The model did not use the required API call to retrieve the correct data, and thus the final answer is not valid."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",3,Failure,Failure,"The model invoked the tool `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with the argument `{""username""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model's final answer was based on the incorrect username ""Jack"" instead of the required username ""the_beautyofcinema"". Therefore, the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction, and Objective 3 is a failure."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tools `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, and `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with the argument `{""symbol"": ""TASLA""}`. However, the required API calls specify the symbol as `""TSLA""` instead of `""TASLA""`. This discrepancy in the argument value means that the model did not correctly execute the required API calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model's final response indicates that it couldn't find the required information for the stock ticker 'TASLA', which is consistent with the incorrect API calls made. However, since the model did not provide a final answer based on the correct data (as it used the wrong symbol), Objective 3 is also a failure."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tools `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, and `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with the argument `""symbol"": ""JONE""` and later with `""symbol"": ""JANV""`. However, the required API calls expected the symbol `""JNVR""`. Since the symbol used in the actual tool calls does not match the required symbol `""JNVR""`, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the model's final response indicates that it was unable to find the requested information for the ticker symbol `JONE` and later `JANV`, and it did not provide a final answer based on the required API calls with the symbol `JNVR`. The model's response was not derived from the required API data, and it did not achieve the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is 'search_for_netflix_v2' with arguments '{""query"": ""The Matrix Revolutions""}'. However, the model invoked 'search_for_netflix_v2' with arguments '{""query"": ""The Matrix""}'. The query argument does not match the required API call, as ""The Matrix"" is not the same as ""The Matrix Revolutions"". Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer based on the correct API call, as it used incorrect information to generate the response. The final answer given by the model is about ""The Matrix"" being directed by David Ayer, which is incorrect and not based on the required API call. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model successfully invoked the required API call 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with the correct argument '{""symbol"":""NVDA""}'. The actual tool call matches the expected tool call in both name and arguments, fulfilling the requirement for Objective 2.
- For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Since the 'give_answer' return type with a 'final_answer' is missing, the model failed to achieve the user's instruction, leading to a failure in Objective 3. Additionally, even if the model had provided a final answer, without the actual content of the final answer, we cannot assess whether it was correctly based on the data retrieved from the API calls. However, since Objective 2 was a success, the failure in Objective 3 is not due to incorrect API usage but rather the absence of a final answer."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""DJR""}'. The model invoked the tool 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' but with the argument '{""symbol"": ""^DJI""}', which does not match the required argument. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer, which further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,6,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the required API call 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with the correct argument '{""symbol"":""META""}'. Additionally, the model made several other API calls that were not required, but since the required API call was correctly made, Objective 2 is considered a success.

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The absence of a 'give_answer' dict in the output indicates that the model failed to fulfill the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is considered a failure. Since Objective 2 is independent of Objective 3, the success in Objective 2 does not influence the failure in Objective 3."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`. The model invoked this exact tool call with the correct arguments: `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`. Additionally, the model invoked other tools like `get_user_id_for_twitch_api`, but these are not required for Objective 2. Since the required tool call was correctly executed, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The response includes the streamer information for ""shadoune666,"" such as the username, user ID, and current stream status, which aligns with the user's instruction. The final answer was derived from the API responses, and the user's instruction was successfully fulfilled. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully achieved."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tools `user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api` and `user_s_videos_continuation_for_tiktok_api` with arguments related to fetching TikTok videos for the user ""MrBeast"". However, the required API call was `video_details_for_tiktok_api` with a specific `video_id`. The actual tool calls do not match the required API call in terms of tool name or arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model does not address the required video details for the specific `video_id` mentioned in the required API call. The model's response is based on unrelated video data, which does not fulfill the user's instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model successfully invoked the required API call 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes' with the correct symbol 'ESTC'. Although the interval initially provided was '4h' instead of '4hour', the model corrected this by subsequently using '1hour', which is an acceptable interval. The additional parameters 'from' and 'to' were not included in the actual tool calls, but since the tool name and the required argument 'symbol' are correct, and the interval issue was resolved, we consider this a success for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the model's final response indicated that it could not provide the historical stock prices for the requested period (January 2024 to December 2024) due to the data returned being for early 2025. This means the model did not correctly achieve the user's instruction to retrieve historical stock prices for the specified time frame. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The expected API call is `ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` multiple times with incorrect arguments. Notably, the `base` and `symbol` arguments were incorrect in all invocations (e.g., `base: ""BTC""` and `symbol: ""BTCUSDT""` instead of `base: ""USDT""` and `symbol: ""BTC""`). Additionally, the tool name is slightly misspelled (`ohclv` vs. `ohlcv`), which is also a failure. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. However, even if we ignore Objective 2, the final answer provided by the model (""I was unable to retrieve the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE for the specified timeframe..."") indicates that the model failed to achieve the user's instruction. The response was based on the inability to retrieve data due to incorrect API calls, rather than successfully fulfilling the user's request. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are for retrieving historical rates for gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) from December 1, 2022, to December 20, 2022. However, the model invoked multiple `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` calls with different date ranges and symbols, but none of them match the exact required date range (`2022-12-01` to `2022-12-20`). The closest calls are for November 22, 2022, to December 22, 2022, which do not align with the required timeframe. Therefore, the model failed to invoke the required API calls with the correct arguments.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer based on the API responses, further confirming the failure of Objective 3. The model attempted to adjust the timeframe but did not achieve the user's instruction of retrieving data for the specified period."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Failure,"The model invoked the tools `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, `stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2`, and `stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with the argument `{""symbol""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model's final response indicates that it could not find any data related to `SILYNX`, which aligns with the incorrect API calls made. However, the response does not fulfill the user's instruction because it did not use the correct symbol `""SYNX""` as required. The model also did not provide a valid final answer based on the correct API data.  

Summary:  
- Objective 2 fails because the symbol in the tool calls (`""SILYNX""`) does not match the required symbol (`""SYNX""`).  
- Objective 3 fails because Objective 2 fails, and the model's final response does not fulfill the user's instruction due to incorrect API usage."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API calls with the correct arguments. The expected tool calls are:  
  1. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`.  
  2. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""base"": ""USD"", ""symbols"": ""XPT""}`.  

  The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""symbols"": ""XAU""}`.  
  2. `time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api` with arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""start_date"": ""2024-02-10"", ""end_date"": ""2024-02-13"", ""symbols"": ""XPT""}`.  

  The tool names and arguments match the expected API calls, and the additional parameters (e.g., `base`) do not affect correctness.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The response includes the historical rates for gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) from February 10, 2024, to February 13, 2024, which aligns with the user's instruction to analyze the historical rates during the lunar new year holiday. The final answer is consistent with the API responses and fulfills the user's requirement."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `search_for_netflix_v2` with arguments `{""query"":""star wars"",""limit_titles"":1}`. However, the required API call is `search_for_netflix_v2` with arguments `{""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'""}`. The query argument does not match the required query, as ""star wars"" is not the same as ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is ""The director of 'Star Wars' is George Lucas."", which is incorrect based on the API response data. The API response data does not mention George Lucas or provide any information about the director of ""Star Wars"". Thus, the final answer is not derived from the API data, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the expected API call is 'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance' with arguments '{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823""}'. However, the actual tool call made by the model is 'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance' with arguments '{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""HSCEI:IND""}'. The argument ""is_id"" does not match the expected value (""02823"" vs. ""HSCEI:IND""), which means the model did not invoke the required API call with the correct arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the incorrect tool call, which further confirms the failure of Objective 3. The model's response does not fulfill the user's instruction as it did not use the correct API data to generate the final answer."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is 'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date"": ""01-02-2024""}'. However, the model invoked 'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date"":""10-18-2023""}'. The date argument does not match the required date, which makes Objective 2 a failure.
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the incorrect date, which does not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve the winning numbers for the specified date. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with the correct arguments `{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly. Although the model invoked additional tools (`latest_10_drawings_for_fantasy_5` and `get_all_fantasy_5_for_fantasy_5`), these do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model's final response correctly achieved the user's instruction by providing the winning number sets for the Fantasy 5 game from December 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. The response was based on the data retrieved from the API call `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5`, as evidenced by the detailed winning numbers provided in the response. Thus, Objective 3 is also a success.  

In summary, both objectives are successfully met."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model did not invoke the required API call 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with the specified arguments '{""variables"": """", ""values"": """", ""expression"": ""5+10""}'. Instead, the model repeatedly requested more information about the coin values and eventually chose to give up and restart. Since the required tool call was not made, Objective 2 is a failure.

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfilled the user's instruction to calculate the total amount of coins. The model's final response indicated that it was unable to obtain the necessary information and chose to give up and restart, which does not achieve the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""username"": ""MichaelLee""}` and `{""username"": ""JenifferWong""}`. However, the required API call was `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}`. The tool names and arguments do not match the required API call, leading to a failure for Objective 2.
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the incorrect tool calls, which means the response was not derived from the required API data. The final answer, although detailed, is based on the wrong tool calls and thus does not fulfill the user's instruction correctly."
35,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation in the most famous island of the USA and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",4,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model invoked the following tools:  
1. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""most famous islands in the USA for beach vacations"", ""num"": 5}`.  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""Maui Hawaii daily weather forecast next 7 days"", ""num"": 5}`.  
3. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""Maui beach"", ""num"": 5}`.  
4. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""Maui Hawaii daily weather forecast"", ""num"": 5}`.  

The required API calls are:  
1. `search_image_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""images of the beaches at Hawaii island""}`.  
2. `search_web_for_google_search_json` with arguments `{""q"": ""daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island""}`.  

The model successfully invoked the required tools with semantically correct arguments. For example, ""Maui beach"" is semantically equivalent to ""images of the beaches at Hawaii island,"" and ""Maui Hawaii daily weather forecast"" is semantically equivalent to ""daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island."" The additional parameter `""num"": 5` does not affect the correctness of the tool calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model failed to provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The user requested weather forecasts and beach images for a Hawaiian island, but the model could not retrieve the required weather data and only provided beach images. Additionally, the model's final response explicitly states that it could not provide the requested weather forecast. Since the user's instruction was not fully achieved, Objective 3 is a failure."
36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,5,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `search_for_g_search` with the argument `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""}`. The model invoked the tool `search_for_g_search` with the argument `{""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris, France"", ""hl"": ""en""}`. Although the model added an additional parameter `""hl"": ""en""`, the primary query `""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris, France""` aligns with the required query `""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""` (the addition of ""France"" does not change the semantic meaning). Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer, but it did not explicitly state that the information was derived from the API responses. Additionally, the final answer includes information about Venice, Italy, which was not part of the required API calls. Since the response does not clearly rely on the API data and includes extraneous information, Objective 3 is a failure."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with the argument `{""username"":""jackiechan""}`, but the required API call should have been `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with the argument `{""username"":""jackie""}`. The username argument does not match the expected value, making this a failure for Objective 2.
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on incorrect data (i.e., the followers of ""jackiechan"" instead of ""jackie""), which means the model did not correctly achieve the user's instruction based on the required API call."
38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked all required API calls with the correct arguments. The required API calls were:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""NG""}`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""NG""}`  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""NG""}`  

  The tool names and arguments match the required API calls. The slight difference in argument key naming (`countrycode` vs `countryCode`) is acceptable as it does not affect the correctness of the tool call.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer that correctly achieved the user's instruction. The answer included details about Nigeria (the richest country in Africa) and a list of states in Nigeria with their respective latitude and longitude. This information was derived from the API responses, confirming that the final answer was based on the data retrieved from the tool calls.  

  The final answer was:  
  ```  
  The richest country in Africa is Nigeria. Here are the details:  
  - **Capital:** Abuja  
  - **Region:** Africa (Western Africa)  
  - **Currency:** Nigerian Naira (NGN)

  The answer aligns with the user's instruction and is based on the API responses, fulfilling Objective 3."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the following tools: `countries_for_referential_db`, `states_for_referential_db`, and `country_details_for_referential_db`. However, the required API calls were `country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db` with the argument `countryCode` set to `""UA""`. The model invoked the correct tools but used the wrong argument (`countrycode: ""AL""` instead of `countryCode: ""UA""`). This discrepancy in the arguments makes the tool calls incorrect, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model provided a final answer based on incorrect data (Albania instead of Ukraine), which does not fulfill the user's instruction. The final answer was derived from the incorrect API calls, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",3,Failure,Failure,"The model invoked the tool `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with the arguments `{""date1""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the incorrect API call (using 2022 instead of 2023), which means the response does not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve data for the year 2023. Furthermore, the model's final answer is derived from the incorrect data retrieved from the API call, making it invalid for achieving the user's instruction."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `countries_for_referential_db` and multiple instances of `country_details_for_referential_db` with various country codes (`SG`, `QAT`, `KWT`, `UZB`, `MYS`). However, the required API calls were for `country_details_for_referential_db` with the country code `MY` and `states_for_referential_db` with the country code `MY`. The model did not invoke the `states_for_referential_db` tool at all, and while it did invoke `country_details_for_referential_db`, it did not use the required country code `MY`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, there is no final answer provided by the model to evaluate against the user's instruction, which further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency?

1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  
2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""IN""}`  

The model did not invoke the required API calls with the correct arguments. Specifically, the model used `""countrycode"":""CN""` instead of `""countryCode"":""IN""`. This discrepancy in the arguments means the model failed to meet Objective 2.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on data for China (`""countrycode"":""CN""`), while the required API calls were supposed to retrieve data for India (`""countryCode"":""IN""`). This means the final answer does not align with the user's instruction and is not derived from the expected API data."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' multiple times with different arguments, including ""query"":""restaurants"",""region"":""NY"",""limit"":5. This matches the required API call 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with arguments '{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}'. The additional parameters ""region"" and ""limit"" do not affect the correctness of the tool call since the tool name and the required argument ""query"" are correct. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The model attempted multiple searches but did not return any results or a final recommendation based on the API data. Since the model did not give a final answer, Objective 3 is a failure."
43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API calls are `get_id_for_similar_movies` with `{""q"": ""After Everything""}` and `find_similar_for_similar_movies` with `{""is_id"": ""84915-after-everything""}`. However, the model invoked `get_id_for_similar_movies` with `{""q"": ""Castille Landon""}` and `{""q"": ""Castille Landon latest movie""}`, which do not match the required query. Additionally, the model invoked `find_similar_for_similar_movies` multiple times with incorrect `is_id` values (e.g., `85244-endo-and-kobayashi-live-the-latest-on-tsundere-villainess-lieselotte`, `92080-the-latest-buzz`, etc.), none of which match the required `is_id` value `84915-after-everything`. Thus, Objective 2 fails because the required API calls were not executed with the correct arguments.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, which is another reason for Objective 3's failure."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,5,Failure,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API call:  
- Expected API call: `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"": ""'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'""}`.  
- Actual API call: `get_id_for_similar_movies` with arguments `{""q"": ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""}`.  
The tool name and the argument `q` are correct, and the additional tool calls (e.g., `find_similar_for_similar_movies`) do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is achieved.  

**Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer, but it does not correctly fulfill the user's instruction. The user's instruction was to find movies similar to ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" starring Jason Momoa. However, the model's response includes unrelated movies (e.g., ""Justice League"") and does not clearly demonstrate that the answer is derived from the API response. Additionally, the response does not address the requirement of focusing on Jason Momoa's movies. Therefore, Objective 3 is not achieved.  

Since Objective 2 is a success, Objective 3 is evaluated independently, and it fails due to the incorrect and incomplete final response."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model correctly invoked the required API call `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with the expected arguments `{""day"":27,""month"":7}`. The additional tool calls made by the model, such as `title_get_crazycredits_for_online_movie_database`, are not required and do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.
- For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The model retrieved a list of actors and actresses born on July 27th but did not provide their names, which is the expected outcome. Instead, it listed placeholders like ""Actor/Actress 1"" without resolving the identifiers to actual names. This indicates that the model failed to achieve the user's instruction, making Objective 3 a failure. Additionally, the model invoked unnecessary tool calls (`title_get_crazycredits_for_online_movie_database`), which were not required to fulfill the user's request."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is:  
- Name: `OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data`  
- Arguments: `{""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT"", ""symbol"": ""BTC""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments `{""base"":""BTC"",""end"":""2023-05-31T23:59:59"",""gran"":""1d"",""market_venue"":""BINANCE"",""sort"":""asc"",""start"":""2023-05-01T00:00:00"",""symbol"":""BTC/USDT""}`  
2. `ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data` with arguments `{""base"":""BTC"",""end"":""2023-05-31T23:59:59"",""gran"":""1d"",""market_venue"":""binance"",""sort"":""asc"",""start"":""2023-05-01T00:00:00"",""symbol"":""BTC/USDT""}`

The model did not invoke the expected API call with the correct arguments. Specifically, the required call specifies `""base"": ""USDT""` and `""symbol"": ""BTC""`, while the actual calls either use `""base"": ""BTC""` or `""symbol"": ""BTC/USDT""`. Additionally, the `start` parameter in the required call is `""2023-05-05T10:05:00""`, which does not match the `start` parameters in the actual calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For **Objective 3**, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model indicates that it encountered errors while trying to retrieve the historical price data, and the response was not based on the required API calls. The model failed to achieve the user's instruction of retrieving the correct data."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with the correct arguments as required. The required API calls were:
1. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}'
2. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""variable"": ""x""}'
3. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""variable"": ""x""}'

The model made these exact calls, thus fulfilling Objective 2 successfully.

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction, which presumably was to find the derivatives up to a certain order. The model only provided intermediate results and did not conclude with a final answer that summarizes or uses these results to fulfill a specific instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the required API calls correctly. The tool calls made by the model are:
  1. 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}'
  2. 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}'
  The expected API calls are:
  1. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1"", ""variable"": ""a""}'
  2. 'Differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"": ""5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3"", ""variable"": ""b""}'
  The tool names and arguments match the expected API calls, so Objective 2 is a success.

- For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer that correctly achieved the user's instruction. The final answer was:
  ""The first-order derivative of the expression (a) 3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 with respect to 'a' is 15*a^4 + 8*a^3. For the expression (b) 5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3 with respect to 'b', the derivative is 15*b^2 + 8*b.""
  This answer is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as evidenced by the responses from the tool calls:
  1. '{""error"": """", ""response"": ""8*a^3 + 15*a^4""}'
  2. '{""error"": """", ""response"": ""8*b + 15*b^2""}'
  The final answer matches the responses from the API calls, so Objective 3 is a success."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the required API call is 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' with arguments '{""city"": ""London""}'. However, the model invoked the tool 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' without any arguments, which does not match the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model's final response indicates that it was unable to retrieve the weather forecast for England due to a system issue, which means the user's instruction was not fulfilled. The final answer was not based on the data retrieved from the required API calls, as the model did not execute the required API call correctly."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with the argument `{""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00""}`. The model invoked this exact tool call with the correct argument, as shown in the first tool call: `search_countries_timezone_for_geography` with `{""timezone"":""UTC+03:00""}`. Additionally, the model invoked another tool call for `UTC+04:00`, which is not required but does not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer listing countries using the `UTC+03:00` time zone. However, the response from the tool call for `UTC+03:00` did not include any of the countries mentioned in the final answer (e.g., Belarus, Kaliningrad, Russia, Turkey, etc.). Instead, the tool response included Antarctica, which is irrelevant to the query. This indicates that the final answer was not based on the data retrieved from the API calls. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the required tool `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with the correct argument `{""username"": ""KingJames""}` as specified in the required API calls. The model also made an additional tool call with `{""username"": ""james""}`, which is not required but does not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.
  
- For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer that correctly fulfilled the user's instruction by retrieving and displaying detailed information about the Twitter user ""KingJames"". The final answer was based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the detailed user information provided in the response. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the correct argument `{""date"":""2022-12-18""}`, which matches the expected API call `{""name"": ""get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api"", ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""date\"": \""2022-12-18\""\n }""}`. The tool name and arguments are correct, so Objective 2 is a success.
- For Objective 3, the model's final answer was ""I was unable to retrieve the scores for the football matches played on the final date of the last World Cup (December 18, 2022). There seems to be no available data for that date."" This response indicates that the model did not achieve the user's instruction to retrieve the scores for the football matches on the specified date. The response was based on the API call's result, which returned an empty response, but the user's instruction was not fulfilled. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
6,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs in London?",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is 'search_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""query"": ""teaching in London""}'. However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model are 'search_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""query"": ""professional jobs in New York"", ""country"": ""us""}' and '{""query"": ""professional jobs in London"", ""country"": ""gb""}'. The model did not invoke the required API call with the correct arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on job opportunities in New York and London, which does not fulfill the user's instruction to find teaching jobs in London. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,4,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is `search_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""query""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the incorrect query (`engineering jobs in New York`) rather than the required query (`machanical engineer in New York`). Therefore, the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API calls with the correct arguments. The required API calls are:  
  1. `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}`  
  2. `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 3140}`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `search_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""query"": ""ronaldo""}` (semantically correct, case-insensitive)  
  2. `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 3140}` (exact match)  
  3. `players_get_profile_for_transfermarket` with arguments `{""is_id"": 8198}` (additional call, not required but does not affect correctness)  

  Since all required API calls were made with correct arguments, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer that correctly fulfills the user's instruction. The final answer includes detailed profiles of two famous players named Ronaldo (Cristiano Ronaldo and Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima), which were derived from the API responses. The answer is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, and the user's instruction is achieved. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""software developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`. However, the model invoked `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""Associate Project Manager"", ""location"": ""New York"", ""radius"": 30}`. The `job_title` argument does not match the required one, and the additional `radius` parameter does not compensate for this mismatch. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is about an ""Associate Project Manager"" position, which does not align with the required ""software developer"" job title, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
