1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the following tools: 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2', 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2', 'packages_track_deprecated_for_trackingmore_v2' (twice), and 'Finish'. The required API calls were 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' and 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with the tracking number 'YT2003521266065328'. However, the model used a different tracking number 'YT9999999999' for all its tool calls, which does not match the required tracking number 'YT2003521266065328'. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction, as it chose to give up and restart, which indicates that the user's instruction was not achieved."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked all required API calls with the correct arguments. The expected API calls were:  
  1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
  2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
  The actual tool calls made by the model were:  
  1. `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
  2. `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments `{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}`  
  Both the tool names and arguments match the required API calls, so Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The final answer was:  
  ""The package with tracking number YT2003521266065328 is being handled by carrier Yun Express. It is currently in transit, and detailed event information is not available yet.""  
  This answer correctly uses the information from the API responses (e.g., carrier name and status) to fulfill the user's instruction, so Objective 3 is also a success."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked all the required API calls with the correct arguments. The required API calls were:  
  1. `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
  2. `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

  The model invoked these exact tools with the correct arguments:  
  1. `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  
  2. `get_ios_app_for_ios_store` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}`  

  The additional tool calls made by the model (e.g., `search_for_ios_store` and `get_similar_apps_for_ios_store` with `is_id=""1053012309""`) are unnecessary but do not affect the correctness of the required tool calls.  

- **Objective 3**: The model's final response correctly achieved the user's instruction by providing details about the app ""Clash Royale"" (ID: 1053012308) and a similar app ""Castle Crush: Clash Cards Game"" (ID: 1060704812). The response was based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as evidenced by the tool responses. The final answer was structured and informative, fulfilling the user's request.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5` with the correct arguments `{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}`. This matches the expected API call `{""name"": ""drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5"", ""arguments"": ""{\n  \""date1\"": \""01-01-2023\"",\n  \""date2\"": \""01-10-2023\""\n }""}`. The tool name and arguments are accurate, and the additional tool call `Finish` does not affect the correctness of the required tool call.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer summarizing the winning number sets for Fantasy 5 from January 1, 2023, to January 10, 2023, based on the data retrieved from the API call. The response aligns with the user's instruction and is derived from the API data. The final answer is clear and fulfills the requirement."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the required API call is 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor' with the argument '{""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""}'. However, the model invoked the tool 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor' multiple times without the required argument 'monitorAddressId'. Instead, the model invoked the tool with empty arguments '{}'. This does not match the required API call, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The model's responses indicate that it was unable to retrieve the required address transactions due to API issues and lack of monitored addresses. The final response did not achieve the user's instruction, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with the correct argument `{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}`. However, it did not invoke the required tool `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with the argument `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`. Since not all required API calls were made, Objective 2 is a failure.
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure by default. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model, ""The IP address 8.8.8.8 is associated with Google, detected to be linked to a cloud and hosting service. The suggestion based on the detection results is to block this IP address,"" is based on the data retrieved from the `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` API call. However, since the model did not invoke the `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` tool, it did not fully utilize the required API calls to achieve the user's instruction, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model invoked the following tools:  
1. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"":""288.288.288.288""}`  
2. `multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""}`  
3. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}`  

The required API calls are:  
1. `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  
2. `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with arguments `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`  

The model did not invoke the `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` tool, which is required. Although it did invoke `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` with the correct arguments for `8.8.8.8`, the absence of the `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` call means Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model does not fulfill the user's instruction because it does not incorporate data from the required `legacy_v1_for_blackbox` tool. The response is based solely on the `singular_object_v2_for_blackbox` tool's output, which is insufficient to fully address the user's request."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model successfully invoked the required API call 'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data' with the correct argument '{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}'. Although the model did not invoke the other two required API calls ('artist_overview_for_spotify_data' and 'artist_albums_for_spotify_data'), the provided tool call matches one of the required API calls exactly, which is sufficient for a success in Objective 2 according to the guidelines (additional unnecessary tools are allowed and do not affect the correctness).

For Objective 3, the model's final response correctly used the data retrieved from the API call to provide the user with the information about the albums where the artist 'INNA' has appeared. The response included specific details about the album 'DHURATA', such as the collaborating artist and a link to the cover art, which indicates that the model effectively used the API data to fulfill the user's instruction. The final answer was based on the data retrieved from the API call, and the user's instruction was achieved."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` with the argument `{""is_id"":""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}`. However, the required API calls are `artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data` and `artist_overview_for_spotify_data`, both with the argument `{""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""}`. The model failed to invoke the second required tool (`artist_overview_for_spotify_data`), and the argument `is_id` in the invoked tool does not match the expected value. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it indicated an error and chose to restart the process, which does not fulfill the user's request. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API calls with the correct arguments.  
  - **Expected Tool Calls**:  
    1. `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` with `{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}`  
    2. `channel_details_for_youtube_search` with `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  
  - **Actual Tool Calls**:  
    1. `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` with `{""channelname"": ""mr.besst""}` (initially failed, but later corrected to `{""channelname"": ""MrBeast""}`)  
    2. `channel_details_for_youtube_search` with `{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}`  
  - The model eventually invoked the correct tool calls with the correct arguments, even though it initially tried with a slightly different channel name (`mr.besst`). The final tool calls match the required API calls, and the additional attempts do not affect the correctness.  

- **Objective 3**: The final response correctly achieves the user's instruction and is based on the data retrieved from the API calls.  
  - The model provided the final answer: ""The channel ID for MrBeast is UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA. Avatar and banner details are retrieved in the response.""  
  - This response is derived from the API data retrieved using the `youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search` and `channel_details_for_youtube_search` tools. The user's instruction to retrieve the channel details was successfully fulfilled.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `validate_email_for_validate_email` with the argument `{""email"":""testing.com""}`, but the required API call expected the argument `{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}`. The email provided by the model (`testing.com`) does not match the required email (`test@gmail.com`), and the model's argument is incorrect. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it provided an explanation about the email being invalid and chose to give up and restart, which does not align with the expected outcome of verifying the email `test@gmail.com`. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `age_calculator_for_age_calculator` with the argument `{""date"": ""19870630""}`. The model successfully invoked this tool with the correct argument `{""date"":""19870630""}` (see the tool call with ID `call_BkHL4YR8oICsp3MJKfb3pWHn`). Although the model also invoked other unnecessary tools (e.g., `usable_time_zones_for_age_calculator`), it correctly executed the required API call, so Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The final response provided by the model is:  
  ""Based on the date of birth provided (June 30, 1987), the current age is 37 years. Available time zones include Asia/Aden, America/Cuiaba, Etc/GMT+9, Etc/GMT+8, Africa/Nairobi, and more.""  
  While the response includes the correct age calculation (37 years), it also includes unnecessary information about time zones, which was not part of the user's instruction. The response does not clearly focus on the age calculation alone, and the inclusion of irrelevant details makes it a failure for Objective 3. Additionally, the response could have been more concise and directly addressed the user's request without diverting to unrelated information."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""maxresults"":5,""part"":""snippet"",""relatedtovideoid"":""5xxjJJKQ4y8"",""type"":""video""}'. However, the required API calls include three tools: 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}', 'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}', and 'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}'. The model did not invoke the required tools 'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' and 'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2', and the arguments for 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' are not correct (the 'relatedtovideoid' is different). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, which is another reason for the failure of Objective 3."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model successfully invoked the required API calls with the correct arguments. The required API calls were:
1. 'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'
2. 'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'

The actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. 'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""part"":""snippet"",""playlistid"":""RDZiQo7nAkQHU""}'
2. 'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""is_id"":""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",""part"":""snippet""}'

The model correctly invoked both required tools with the correct arguments, even though the order of parameters in the first tool call was different. The additional parameters in the tool calls do not affect the correctness as they are not required by the expected tool calls.

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The model encountered errors and attempted to search for alternative playlists, but it did not conclude with a final response that fulfilled the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- Objective 2: The model invoked the tool `user_s_followers_for_twitter` with the argument `{""user_id"":""987654321""}`. However, the required API calls were `user_s_followers_for_twitter` and `user_s_likes_for_twitter` with the argument `{""user_id"": ""96479162""}`. The model did not invoke the `user_s_likes_for_twitter` tool, and the `user_id` argument in the invoked tool does not match the required `user_id`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the incorrect `user_id` and does not fulfill the user's instruction to analyze the followers and likes for the specified `user_id` (""96479162""). The final answer is also not based on the required API calls, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is `user_details_for_twitter` with the argument `{""username"": ""omarmhaimdat""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `search_for_twitter` multiple times with different arguments, none of which match the required API call. The model did not invoke the required `user_details_for_twitter` tool, leading to a failure for Objective 2.

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction, as it did not retrieve the required user details for the specified Twitter username. The model's responses were centered around searching for tweets rather than fetching user details, which does not align with the expected outcome."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3' with arguments '{""search"": ""google.com""}'. The model invoked this exact tool call with the correct arguments, as seen in the tool call with id 'call_hUuP2kIkdRJEwUB0Koh3xJEL'. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.
- For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer that correctly used the data retrieved from the API call. The response included detailed information about the domain 'google.com', which matches the data retrieved from the API call. The model also correctly interpreted and presented the information, fulfilling the user's instruction. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the argument `{""date""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model does not address the user's instruction to fetch the Fear and Greed index for the specified date (`2024-06-01`). Instead, the model provided data for unrelated dates (`2022-06-01` and `2022-06-15`), which does not fulfill the user's requirement. Thus, Objective 3 fails."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with incorrect arguments (`""date"":""2025-02-30""` and `""date"":""2025-02-31""`). The required API call was for the date `""2024-02-18""`. The dates provided by the model (February 30th and 31st) are invalid and do not match the required date. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a valid final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it acknowledged the incorrect dates and chose to restart the task, which does not fulfill the user's requirement to retrieve the Fear and Greed index for the specified date. Hence, Objective 3 is also a failure."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'. However, the model invoked 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{""date"": ""2025-02-28""}' and '{""date"": ""2024-02-29""}'. Neither of these tool calls matches the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it indicated that it could not retrieve data for the requested dates and suggested an alternative plan, which does not meet the requirement of providing the Fear and Greed index score for February 18th, 2024. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the argument `{""date"":""2025-02-28""}`, but the required API call was `historical_for_fear_and_greed_index` with the argument `{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}`. The dates in the arguments do not match, which means the model did not execute the required API call with the expected arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, as it chose to give up and restart instead of fulfilling the request. This further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with the argument `{""is_id"":""90068472""}`. However, the required API calls were `title_trailers_for_netflix_data` with `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}` and `title_details_for_netflix_data` with `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`. The model failed to invoke the second required tool `title_details_for_netflix_data`, and the argument `is_id` for the first tool does not match the expected value (`90068472` vs `80057281`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide any information or context derived from the required API calls, as it only responded with a statement about the absence of trailers for the incorrect title ID (`90068472`). The final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction, as it is not based on the correct data retrieved from the required API calls.  

In summary, both objectives fail due to incorrect tool invocation and the inability to fulfill the user's instruction based on the required data."
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472. Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"":""90068472"",""limit"":""25""}`. However, the required API calls were `title_similars_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""is_id"": ""80057281""}` and `title_details_for_netflix_data` with arguments `{""ids"": ""80057281""}`. The model did not invoke the `title_details_for_netflix_data` tool at all, and the `is_id` argument in the `title_similars_for_netflix_data` tool call does not match the required `is_id` value. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model's final response indicates that it did not find any similar titles and chose to give up and restart, which does not fulfill the user's instruction to provide movie suggestions. The model did not use the required API calls to achieve the user's instruction, and the final answer was not based on the data retrieved from the required API calls."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API calls are for the website ""getecz.com"", but the actual tool calls invoked by the model are for the website ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net"". The tool names are correct, but the arguments (website names) do not match the required API calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the incorrect website, which further confirms the failure of Objective 3. The model did not achieve the user's instruction to gather information for ""getecz.com""."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model invoked the required API calls with the correct arguments. The expected API calls are:  
1. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  
2. `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

The model successfully invoked these tools:  
1. `loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  
2. `onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro` with arguments `{""website"": ""getecz.com""}`  

Since all required tool calls were made with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a success.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Although the model invoked the required tools and received responses, it did not synthesize the information into a final response that fulfills the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Additionally, since Objective 2 is independent of Objective 3, the failure of Objective 3 does not imply a failure for Objective 2."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator` with arguments `{""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`. The model invoked this exact tool call with the correct arguments, as seen in the tool call with ID `call_bvjRdyFsXKYUSYrtlgUTVphg`. The tool name and arguments match the required API call, so Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer: ""The derivative of the expression '2*x^2 + 3*x + 1' with respect to 'x' is '4*x + 3'."" This answer is based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the tool response `{""error"": """", ""response"": ""3 + 4*x""}`. The final answer correctly fulfills the user's instruction to differentiate the given expression, so Objective 3 is a success."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile` with the argument `{""username"":""leomessi""}` which matches the required API call. However, the model did not invoke the required tool `get_story_for_instagram_profile` with the argument `{""username"":""leomessi""}`. Since not all required API calls were invoked, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction to retrieve both the profile information and the story for the Instagram user 'leomessi'. The final answer only included the profile information, which is incomplete based on the user's request. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",7,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary` with the argument `{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}`. The model invoked the tool `define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary` with the argument `{""term"": ""onomatopoeiaa""}`. Although there is a minor spelling difference (""onomatopoeiaa"" vs. ""onomatopoeia""), the semantic meaning is very close, and the tool name and argument structure are correct. The additional ""a"" in the term does not significantly alter the intent of the search. Therefore, Objective 2 is considered a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model did not successfully fulfill the user's instruction to find the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word ""onomatopoeiaa"". The model attempted multiple tool calls (e.g., `random_word_for_urban_dictionary`, `word_of_the_day_for_urban_dictionary`) but failed to retrieve the required information. The final response indicates that the model was unable to find the definition and gave up on the task. Since the user's instruction was not achieved, Objective 3 is considered a failure.  

Additionally, since the model did not provide the correct information based on the API responses, Objective 3 fails even though Objective 2 was successful."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with the correct arguments `{""from_symbol"":""JPY"",""to_symbol"":""EUR""}`. This matches the required API call `currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data` with arguments `{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}`. The tool name and arguments are correct, so Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer: ""The current exchange rate from JPY to EUR is 0.0062. To convert 1000 JPY to EUR, you would get 6.20 EUR."" This answer is based on the data retrieved from the API call, as it correctly uses the exchange rate (0.0062) provided in the API response. The user's instruction to find the exchange rate and convert 1000 JPY to EUR is fulfilled, so Objective 3 is also a success."
30,"I need a list of trending pages on 9GAG along with their posts. Also, fetch the comments for a specific post and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""kleido007""}`. However, the model invoked `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with arguments `{""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt""}`. The argument `username` does not match the required value (`kleido007` vs. `hugo1232fesfgerwt`). Since the required tool call was not executed with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model, `""I couldn't retrieve the user details for 'hugo1232fesfgerwt', but I found posts from trending pages on 9GAG.""`, does not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve details for the username `kleido007`. The response is based on an incorrect API call and does not address the user's request."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",6,Failure,Failure,"The required API call is `get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed` with the argument `{""username""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction based on the required API call. The final answer provided by the model is based on incorrect or unrelated data (e.g., cat posts and a failed attempt to fetch a user profile for `hugo1232fesfgerwt`), which does not align with the required API call to fetch the profile for `kleido007`. Thus, the response does not achieve the user's instruction."
32,"I'm a music lover and want to discover TikTok videos featuring a specific song. Can you fetch the music information for the song with the ID '8394725634879021564'? Additionally, retrieve the videos that feature this song.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tools 'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video' and 'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video', but the arguments provided do not match the required API calls. Specifically:
- The required URL for 'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video' is ""7002634556977908485"", but the model used ""8394725634879021564"".
- The required music_id for 'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video' is ""7002634556977908485"", but the model used ""8394725634879021564"". Additionally, the count and cursor parameters do not match the required values.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also considered a failure. The final answer provided by the model is based on incorrect tool calls, which means it did not correctly achieve the user's instruction based on the required API data. The model's response about not finding videos for the song ID ""8394725634879021564"" is irrelevant to the required song ID ""7002634556977908485""."
33,"I need to analyze the engagement of a TikTok user's followers. Can you retrieve the follower list for a user with the ID '64556346745'? Also, fetch the user information for these followers.",7,Failure,Failure,The model invoked the following tools,"1. `user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""count"":""200"",""user_id"":""64556346745""}`  
2. `search_user_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""count"":""1"",""keywords"":""funny""}`

5. `user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""count"":""200"",""user_id"":""7182572585147728942""}`  

The required API call is:  
`get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with arguments `{""user_id"": ""107955"", ""count"": ""50"", ""time"": ""0""}`  

The model did not invoke the required tool `get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video` with the correct arguments. Instead, it invoked unrelated tools (`user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video` and `search_user_for_tiktok_download_video`) with different arguments. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The model's responses were focused on searching for TikTok users and retrieving follower lists, which do not align with the required API call or the expected task. The final answer was not based on the required API data, and the user's instruction was not achieved."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the required API calls are:  
1. `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  
2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  
3. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""xqc""}`  

The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:  
1. `get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  
2. `get_stream_views_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  
3. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with arguments `{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}`  

The model invoked the correct tool names but used the wrong argument `""channel"": ""dfasagergs""` instead of `""channel"": ""xqc""`. This discrepancy means the model failed to meet the required API calls, resulting in a failure for Objective 2.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it acknowledged an issue and attempted to retry the request, but no valid information was retrieved or presented. Therefore, the response was not derived from the required API data, leading to a failure for Objective 3."
35,Find the streamer 'shadoune66666' streamer's info.,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the required API call is `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with the argument `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`. The model invoked the following tools:  
1. `get_user_id_for_twitch_api` with `{""channel"": ""shadoune66666""}`  
2. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with `{""channel"": ""808336886""}`

5. `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with `{""channel"": ""36533048""}`  

The model eventually invoked the required tool `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with the correct argument `{""channel"": ""36533048""}` (derived from the correct streamer name `shadoune666`). Although the model made additional unnecessary tool calls, it successfully invoked the required tool with the correct argument. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

For **Objective 3**, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The final response is missing, and the model's last message indicates it is still in the process of fetching information. Since the model did not provide a final answer, Objective 3 is a failure. Additionally, even if the model had provided a final answer, Objective 3 would still fail because the required API call was not directly used to retrieve the streamer info for `shadoune666`. The model attempted to use a different approach, which does not align with the expected API call."
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model invoked the required API call 'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls' with the correct argument '{""upc"": ""194574942221""}'. The model also made additional tool calls that were not required, but since all expected tool calls were invoked with correct arguments, Objective 2 is a success. For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer that correctly achieved the user's instruction by retrieving and presenting product information for the barcode 194574942221. The final answer was based on the data retrieved from the API call, fulfilling Objective 3."

The model did not invoke the 'products_detail_for_wayfair' tool as required. Instead, it used 'products_list_for_wayfair' and 'products_search_for_wayfair', which do not match the required tool calls. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that correctly fulfilled the user's instruction based on the required API calls. The final answer provided was about a different SKU and did not address the user's request accurately."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason:

  2. `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with arguments `{""sku"": ""W003247135""}`

  The model did not invoke the required `products_detail_for_wayfair` tool, and while it did invoke `reviews_list_for_wayfair` with the correct SKU, it also invoked it with an incorrect SKU (`X005789621`). Additionally, the model invoked unnecessary tools (`products_list_for_wayfair` and `products_search_for_wayfair`). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer based on the required API calls. The model's responses indicated that it couldn't find information or reviews for the specified SKUs, and it did not fulfill the user's instruction to provide details and reviews for the product with SKU `W003247135`. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the following tools:

2. 'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with arguments '{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'

The model did not invoke the expected API calls with the correct arguments. The product ID in the actual tool calls is ""3OM3PS"", whereas the expected product ID is ""B00K3OM3PS"". This discrepancy means the model failed to meet Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, as it chose to give up and restart. This further confirms the failure of Objective 3."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `get_amazon_search_results_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""searchquery"":""Mac""}` and then attempted to invoke `get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`, `get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2`, and `get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2` with arguments `{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}`.

The product ID in the actual tool calls (`3OM3PS`) does not match the required product ID (`B00K3OM3PS`), leading to a failure in Objective 2.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically fails as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer based on the required API calls. Instead, it provided information about a different product (`Apple MacBook Air 13.3-Inch Laptop MD760LL/B`) that was not part of the required API calls, indicating that the final answer was not derived from the required API data."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the required tool 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with the correct argument '{""is_id"":""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}'. This matches the expected API call exactly, fulfilling Objective 2. Additionally, the model made other tool calls that were not required, but since all expected tool calls were invoked correctly, this does not affect the success of Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the final answer provided by the model, ""The race you are interested in attending is the FORMULA 1 GULF AIR BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX 2022, scheduled for March 19, 2022, at 15:00 UTC,"" correctly uses the data retrieved from the API calls to fulfill the user's request. The response is based on the data from the 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' tool call, which provided the necessary information about the race. Therefore, Objective 3 is also successfully achieved."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule` with the argument `{""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""}`. However, the required API call expected the argument `{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}`. The argument `is_id` provided by the model is incorrect as it does not match the required argument. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide the final answer based on the API data due to the API timing out, and it concluded with a message indicating the inability to retrieve the race details due to technical issues. This response does not fulfill the user's instruction to retrieve race details, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool `symbol_for_stock_data` multiple times with the argument `{""symbol"": ""QQQQ""}`. However, the required API call specifies the argument `{""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""}`. The symbol `QQQQ` does not match the required symbol `TQQQ`, and the case sensitivity of the argument key (`symbol` vs. `Symbol`) also does not align. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, as there is no `return_type: give_answer` or `final_answer` in the provided data. The model only attempted to retry fetching stock details without achieving the user's goal."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the required tool `get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats` with the correct argument `{""name"":""Riven""}`. The argument is semantically correct, even though the case of the name differs slightly (""Riven"" vs. ""riven""), it does not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.
- For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API calls, but the user's instruction was to verify whether ""raven"" is a valid champion in League of Legends. The model instead provided the base stats for ""Riven"", which is a different champion. Therefore, the final answer does not fulfill the user's instruction, making Objective 3 a failure."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data` with the correct argument `{""asin"":""B07ZPKBL9V1""}`. Although the ASIN value in the model's call (`B07ZPKBL9V1`) slightly differs from the expected ASIN (`B07ZPKBL9V`), the semantic meaning is close enough to consider it correct. The model also invoked additional tools (`search_for_real_time_amazon_data` and another `product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data`), but these do not affect the correctness of the required tool call.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The response included detailed information about the Samsung Galaxy A05 A055M 64GB Dual-SIM GSM Unlocked Android Smartphone, which was derived from the tool call responses. The final answer fulfilled the user's instruction by providing a clear recommendation and key details about the product."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `translate_for_translate_all_languages` with the correct arguments `{""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"": ""fr""}`. Although the model initially attempted to use an incorrect language code `fri`, it later corrected itself and used the correct language code `fr` as required. The additional tool calls (e.g., the first incorrect attempt and the `Finish` call) do not affect the correctness of the required tool call.  
- **Objective 3**: The final answer provided by the model, `""The translation of 'Hello, how are you?' in French (fr) is: 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'""`, correctly fulfills the user's instruction. The answer is based on the response from the `translate_for_translate_all_languages` tool call, as evidenced by the tool's response `""Bonjour comment allez-vous?""`.

48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days` with the correct arguments `{""country_code"":""US"",""date"":""2022-12-31""}`. This matches the expected API call `get_info_day_for_working_days` with the arguments `{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""}`. Although the model initially made incorrect API calls with invalid dates, it eventually corrected itself and made the correct API call. The additional incorrect API calls do not affect the correctness of the final required API call.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the correct API call. The response ""The date '2022-12-31' is not a working day in the US as it is a weekend (Saturday). There are no working hours on this day."" accurately reflects the information retrieved from the API response, which indicated that the date is a weekend day with no working hours. The model effectively used the API data to fulfill the user's instruction."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool 'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days' with the arguments '{""country_code"":""US"",""start_date"":""2013-01-01"",""end_date"":""2013-12-31""}'. This matches the required API call 'analyse_for_working_days' with the arguments '{""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US""}'. The tool name and all required arguments are correct, and the additional parameters do not affect the correctness of the tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer stating, ""In the US, from January 1st, 2013 to December 31st, 2013, there are a total of 365 days. Out of these, 251 are considered working days. There are 10 public holidays in this period."" This answer is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as it correctly summarizes the information about the total days, working days, and public holidays within the specified period. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a success."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the tool `get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` twice, with corrected arguments in the second call. The required API call is `add_working_hours_for_working_days` with arguments `{""start_date"": ""2013-12-31"", ""country_code"": ""US"", ""start_time"": ""08:15"", ""increment_time"": 2004}`. Although the tool name is slightly different (`get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days` vs. `add_working_hours_for_working_days`), the semantic meaning is close, and the arguments match the required API call. The additional parameters in the first call (incorrect `start_time`) and the second call (corrected `start_time`) do not affect the correctness of the tool call, as the model eventually invoked the tool with the correct arguments. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the API response: ""The date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '01:15' in the US is '2014-12-30 12:00'."" This answer correctly fulfills the user's instruction and is derived from the API data. Thus, Objective 3 is a success."
