1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' used the arguments '{""date1"":""12-01-2022"",""date2"":""12-31-2022""}', which mismatch the expected API call arguments that required '{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}'. Due to this discrepancy in the argument values, Objective 2 is a failure. Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call, as required, was for 'hot_100_for_billboard' with arguments '{ ""date"": ""2022-07-20"" }'. The actual executed tool calls by the model include two ineffective attempts with arguments '{""date"":""latest""}' and '{""date"":""2023-10-14""}', and two effective calls with dates ""2023-10-14"" and ""2022-07-20"". The necessary call for the date ""2022-07-20"" was made, satisfying requirements, but since initially, an incorrect API call was made for the incorrect date leading the process wrong, the prolonged date mix-ups led to the label failure for Objective 2.

Reason quoted for Objective 3 failure solely rests on the foundation laid by Objective 2 being unsatisfactory, thus secondary finding focusing on failure in returning answering using tool-led proper intelligence collection and feedback is also inconsistent and is neglected to offer the reliability check coil that loops back precisely to tool suggestion inputs largely in disappointed offer rejection realm Naked vis-a-vis users instructions meet inability thus in diagnosed failed objective structure."
3,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Billboard chart information on '2020-03-18' ?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call needed was 'billboard_200_for_billboard' with the argument '{""date"":""2020-03-18""}', which matches one of the model's tool calls precisely. However, the initial query indicated additional requirements implicitly such as fetching data from 'hot_100_for_billboard' and 'artist_100_for_billboard', which were actually called by the tool but not specified in the explicitly expected calls. Since those are analogous to a successful user's requirement, as seen under Ordinary demands for charts, this showcase satisfies typical informational queries but does not align completely with the regimen provided due to only listing one expected tool call regarding Zelda or Entry plans, thus causing a failure according to the conferred regulations where all implicitly required aspects must be guaranteed especially when deriving outcomes hence a failure in Objective 2 directly advises one above Objective 3 as well making it incidental."
4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was to invoke 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' with '{}'. Although the model invoked the correct function 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes' as one of its three calls, the other necessary API calls which should be required but mentioned isn't labeled (potentially 'motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes' and 'love_quote_for_olato_quotes' based on the evident intent), indicating that not all expected calls were defined in this provided required set. However the response focuses specifically and solely on requiring 'success_quote_for_olato_quotes,' therefore, based on incomplete required API calls provided and unable to verify all actual necessary decisions, we judge a Fail. Considering Objective 2 failed, it automatically leads to a failure for Objective 3."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The analysis for Objective 2 considers whether all required API calls, based on the specified expected API call, were correctly made by the model. Regarding.MATCH expected tool call: 
'name': 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktwicasiaeld', 'arguments': { ""keyword"": ""technology"", ""countryCode"": ""US"" }
Actual tool calls cover finds correlation through the arguments specified:
1. 'name': 'getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld', 'arguments': '{""countrycode"":""US"",""keyword"":""technology"",""multiplequestions"":true}'

Although the argument names include ""multiplequestions"" (not required by prompt but does not affect correctness) and slight variations in argument naming (""countrycode"" vs ""countryCode""), they accomplish the needed check for both ""technology"" related questions and country code ""US"", which coincides semantically and functionally with the prompt requirement.

Objective 3, unrelated task success in Objective 2 factors whether the final output provided by the model correctly utilizes the results of successfully-made API calls to serve the user’s instruction. Upon observing that:

6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,7,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments for ""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"" and ""location"": ""New York"". The logs show that the model made this required API call successfully. Hence Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the final model's output shows an error message related to functionality rather than successfully using the correct data or APIs toward performing the task, indicated by issues while attempting to search for jobs specifically in New York. Also, the system logs mention the ""give_up_and_restart"" action without effectively providing an applicable option to the user about subsequent job search questions. Thus it fails because the response was not adequate, informative, or aligned with user instructions continuously provided by successful API data fetch."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' with arguments '{""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}'. The actual API calls made by the model match these specifications, with 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' invoked multiple times with arguments that include 'job_title' as ""Node.JS Developer"" (semantically matching 'nodejs developer') and 'location' as ""New York"". Even with variant keyword configurations in JSON arguments and different capitalizations and notations, they are all essentially aiming towards what the required call specified for job projections in New York.

For Objective 3, although the tools calling 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch' are present in the interactions, since there's no final answer or concluding remark providing salary information nor addressing the intention in the dataset mentioned derived from these API calls, the interaction ended with the model describing to continue searching for salary estimates which it fails to achieve as part of the outcome expected by the user's instruction. Hence Objective 3 fails as the instructions or goals through the acquired data aren't met in the response given by the system."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call requires 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with arguments including '""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""', but the actual calls made to 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' had arguments set as '""username"":""your_username""'. This difference in the 'username' argument doesn't meet the required target of ""the_beautyofcinema."" Therefore, Objective 2 fails as the required API call with the exact expected arguments was not observed. Consequently, Objective 3 automatically fails since the primary requirement of making the correct API call was not met."
9,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected tool call included 'video_details_for_tiktok_api' with the argument 'video_id' set to '7097255034731138310'. The corresponding actual tool call from the model also used 'video_details_for_tiktok_api' with 'video_id': '7097255034731138310'. Hence, all expected tool calls were made correctly, fulfilling Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the final output delivered detailed information taken correctly from the result of the API call including the description of the video, creation time, and author information as detailed under video details. The argument matched the information from\Response (Author - Abbey Sharp, Description, and time). Thus, the final response accurately addressed the user's instructions based on accurate API data, successfully fulfilling Objective 3."
10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,7,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:
- The actual API call made was 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{""ids"":""44196397,155659213""}'.
- The required API call was 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{ ""ids"": ""44196397, 155659213""}'.
Despite a minor formatting difference in spacing within the ""ids"" value in the arguments, the arguments themselves effectively deliver the same IDs and comply with the semantic intention of the required API call since identifiers like whitespace will often be treated similarly in rest localhost=]
- Therefore, Objective 2 is deemed a success as the pain points small enough and does not consider it a failure condition: hence retaining the validity of information required in the call.

For Objective 3:
- The final responses to the assistant's call(data from the actual API call) show that the profiles for the Twitter users were correctlyretrieved, presented, and based on the user's instruction to gather user profiles for specific IDs.
- I.e:

11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the actual tool that was invoked is 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments '{""username"":""yousuck2020""}'. The required tool call matches exactly with ['{""name"": ""user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2""', ' ""arguments"": ""{\\n ""username"": ""yousuck2020""\\n }""']. Therefore, all parameters and tool name are correctly matched, leading to a success in Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the model provided a final response indicating that it had successfully retrieved the user Twitter information including the biography and follower count, which matches the data extracted via the API tools regarding ""bio,"" ""follower count,"" and also mentioned the user's location as 'Not Specified', identifying and addressing specifics from the data retrieved by the tool call regarding the user. The final answer utilized the data extracted from this tool ('user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2'). These demonstrated that the model effectively used the retrieved API data to create the final answer hence achieving the end goal prescribed in the user's original instruction. Hence, Objective 3 is regarded as successful."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls were:
1. 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{""q"": ""Hawaii""}'
2. 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""}'

The actual API calls made by the model were:
1. 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{""q"": ""destination beaches"", ""num"": 1}'
2. 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with arguments '{""q"": ""daily weather forecast next 7 days at destination"" , ""num"": 1}' (called multiple times)

None of the actual tool calls match the required arguments and there were evident discrepancies, as:
- For 'search_image_for_google_search_json', the required argument was for 'Hawaii', but the model executed it with 'destination beaches'.
- For 'search_web_for_google_search_json', the required argument was 'weather forecast in Hawaii', but the actual calls were concerning solely 'daily weather forecast next 7 days at destination'.

Objective 2 thus failed as neither of the required calls was appropriately executed.
Since Objective 2 demonstrates failure indicating incorrect or incomplete API calls relative to user directive, Objective 3 accordingly documents a failure due to reliance on incogitant and inaccurate API call outcomes to serve customer requests."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: According to the required API call information, there was a need for a specific API that corresponds with the tool call code pattern executed for gathering data for 'popular attractions in Paris'. The expected tool call is:

Request: 
- Tool: 'search_for_g_search' 
- Arguments: '{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}'

The actual tool call made by the model:
- Tool: 'search_for_g_search'
- Argument: '{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}'

One match is consistent with the whole description; however, there is no record or hint of the entity involved in garnering information for 'popular attractions in {\}SOME LOCATION{\}`, because that performed as static/unaltered or incorrect goal not depending upon entity Spurs observation from Paris specifically which marks fulfilling action pattern as unsuccessful. Such specificity deviation earns it a mark failing hence unable to fulfill the required APIs fully.

For Objective 3, Objective 2 needs to be a prerequisite to be fulfilled correctly, which it wasn’t, so this also results in a failure for Objective 3 since the employed tools failed to satisfactorily achieve the setup configuration, meaning information presented might err considering full context incorporation failures triggered by unable API usage corresponding to declared needs."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: Regarding Objective 2, even though the actual:
'\{""name"": ""carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2"", ""arguments"": \{""trackingnumber"":""NY323068998GB""\}\}' 
calls are not an exact text match with the expected:
'{""name"": ""carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2"", ""arguments"": ""{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""\n  }""}'
due to the discrepancy in capitalization of dictionary key 'trackingNumber', it does align with first level comprehension in that the same variable with the slight difference in hyphenation refers to the same intended specific property: the tracking number for the given service. Hence, receiving the necessary data, catering the expected behavior, proves successfully resolving the given user instruction tool necessity making a success for Objective 2.

Concerning Objective 3, several subsequent process calls intended to fetch package status were made, however, those have not yielded actionable responses, as highlighted from the line ""\I couldn't retrieve tracking details for the package with the tracking number 'NY323068998GB' due to unavailable information from both carriers. Please try again later or verify the tracking number."". This assertion followed a submission note about an error on the model's part on failing to acquire the desired details from the expected deliveries suggests a failed realization of the user’s command initiating from a failure in relating the tool resultant matter with real-time conclusive obligation meant to satiate user query necessarily proving Objective 3 as failed."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with an argument '{\n  ""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""\n  }'. The tool actually invoked was 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"":""123456789""}'. The argument ""trackingNumber"" specified with value ""NY323068998GB"" in the expected call has a correct spelling, while provider has query parameter as lower case only (""trackingnumber"") with a completely different value (""123456789""). This semantic difference (notably incorrect tracking number and its value) offers a failed match with the expected API call argument, hence Objective 2 is failed. Since Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 directly fails as well, regardless of the final outcome or usage of the detected tools in finalizing the task."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call that aligns with one of the required was witnessing the function 'followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro' getting called with an argument '{ ""username"": ""jackie"" }', matching exactly what was expected in the required API call. This is satisfactory based on the information given and ensures Objective 2's success, as it meets critical requirements of the expected API call argument).

Reflecting sort of mutual success upon Objective 3—they administered the corresponding tool adaptation smartly after conflicted with an invalid username and rerouted to ultimately collect and thoroughly confirming data via the proper source or, I mean, approved tool handling ensuring to panels the follower details strictly logged under username 'jackie'. Eventually, concluding with the correct synthesized and thoughtful outcome plastered generically while aligning with reliable pipeline tool/service (""Finish"") wisdom transforms these overall results into stable points celebrities silhouetted under Objective 2 easily also categorizes result equipped via directive lead to Interval concludes into."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model was tasked with invoking an API to gather information on properties using the 'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2' tool. However, the expected call specifically termed for the input '{""address"":""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}', yet the model tried multiple different addresses ('San Francisco, CA', 'Downtown San Francisco, CA', and just 'San Francisco') and variations thereof, but none matched the required exact address of ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404"". Thus, the model failed to meet the precise tool argument required for Objective 2.
Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure as well. An additional check was to see if the final answer achieved the instructions based on the API calls. However, the model didn't even issue a binding final response to the user’s query aligned explicitly with correct API results because the tools called by the model are inaccurately purposed from the start. Since Objective 2 already failed, discussing natural alignment was unnecessary but reinforced due to faulty addresses causing all initial dataset needs to be misaligned."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is 'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search' with arguments specifying a search in ""50 miles radius"" and ""location"" as ""12750"". However, the actual API call made by the model had the ""location"" argument as ""Kenoza Lake, NY"" instead, though it correctly covered ""search_within_x_miles"" as 50. This does not accurately fulfill the required argument specifications since ""12750"" and ""Kenoza Lake, NY"" contain different semantic detail despite referring to linked geographical entities. Therefore, the condition for Objective 2, about the exact execution of required API calls with expected arguments, is not met, leading to a direct inference that Objective 3 is also a failure."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the function 'invalid_hallucination_function_name' twice which was incorrectly named for the expected function 'realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data'. Additional attempts only featured the incorrectly named tool which generated errors, and settings give up response. Therefore, the tool expected was never correctly invoked. As there were critical discrepancies in both the function name and ensuing functionality to complete the task, Objective 2 is failed. Because Objective 2 failed due to the misuse of function invocation and lack of required data retrieval, Objective 3 also failed as there was no meaningful output or correct execution of user instruction derived from the supposed API calls."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call mentioned in the description was for 'time_zone_for_geodb_cities' with the specific argument '{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}'. The actual tool calls made by the catalyst did not match the expected requirement as they did not target the specified naive in the 'zoneid' nor the specific tool name ('time_zones' vs. 'time_zone'). Multiple other tool calls such as 'time_zones_for_geodb_cities', 'admin_divisions_near_location_for_geodb_cities', 'countries_for_geodb_cities', and 'city_details_for_geodb_cities' were made, none of which fulfill the expected tool invocation based on the parameters provided. As Objective 2 is a failure due to the incorrect or missing required tool call, Objective 3 is also marked as a failure, per evaluation guidelines that follow from failure in Objective 2. Additionally, no final answer was presented directly addressing the user query as forwarded, so explicitly fail on Objective 3 as non-dependent confirmation as well."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was:
'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{
  ""countryCode"": ""DE""
  }'
However, the actual tool called by the model intending to fulfil this request was:
'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{
  ""countrycode"":""DE""

The tool call failed because the argument key in actual API fact was all lowercase (""countrycode""), whereas the expected alone categorized ""D"" as CUDA OCC_flipmine difference UDP can.

Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls specify:
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with arguments '{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }'.
2. 'cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db' with arguments '{ ""countryCode"": ""QA"" }'.

The actual tools invoked by the model are:

4. 'states_for_referential_db' with arguments '{""countrycode"":""GE""}', which is also not required.

The discrepancies between the expected ""countryCode"":""QA"" and the model’s use of “countrycode"":""GE"" show that the required API calls with the necessary arguments were not correctly invoked. As such, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 also fails. The model did articulate an answer relating to Georgia but that data was not sourced using the specified codes from 'QA' which relate to the country of Qatar but incorrectly specified capabilities related to the country of Georgia."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The model made the required tool calls correctly:
- Actual call by model: 'country_details_for_referential_db' (with arguments '{""countrycode"": ""JP""}')
- Required API call: 'country_details_for_referential_db' (with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""JP""}')
- Actual call by model: 'states_for_referential_db' (with arguments '{""countrycode"": ""JP""}' invoked twice)
- Required API call: 'states_for_referential_db' (with arguments '{""countryCode"": ""JP""}')

For Objective 3, though there was an attempt to provide a final answer regarding the details for Japan including prefectures, the final process should provide a narrative within a particular function, labeled as 'final_answer'. No further answer was processed with 'return_type' as 'give_answer,' instead, an erroneous finish attempt was made without complexity and syntax fit done through effective tools. This leavse completion unfulfilled relative to user's instructions."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is 'get_photos_for_realtor_search' with the arguments '{""property_id"":""2215556385""}'. The actual tool calls involved several APIs, including 'get_photos_for_realtor_search' with the correct argument ('{""property_id"":""2215556385""}'). However, there are tool uses unrelated to the expected requirement ('search_for_sale_for_realtor_search', 'search_for_rent_for_realtor_search', and 'auto_complete_for_realtor_search' without any instruction or requirement given). This excessive, unrelated tool use leads to failure. Additionally, many tools were used which did not align with our expectation leading to information unrelated to the directive, hence disrupting the proper validation for execution. As Objective 2 is a fail, Objective 3 is directly a fail with no further explanation needed, aside from it not aligning with user's instruction or dealing directly with data fetch to response connection per requirement."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call required is 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with argument '{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}'. However, the actual tool calls made by the model use two different tools. The calls with function 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' had arguments '{""fields"":""name,rating"",""language"":""en"",""limit"":5,""query"":""intimate dining restaurant, New York"",""region"":""US""}' indicating repeated additional parameters and misalignment in the 'query' parameter (""intimate dining restaurant, New York"" vs ""restaurants, NY, USA""). No direct match was made for the specified essential argument in the required API call for the queried parameter, considering the significant content gap in 'query' search terms ('restaurants, NY, USA' vs 'intimate dining restaurant, New York'). This discrepancy implies false completion of the necessary expected usage of API capabilities indicated by required API calls. As Objective 2 is failed, based on the established conditions, it also corresponds directly to the failure of Objective 3."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool calls were aimed at calling 'loginuser_for_pet_store' and 'getpetbyid_for_pet_store' with specific arguments including formulated parameters of username, password, and petId. The actual invoked tool for 'loginuser_for_pet_store' correctly matched with the properly structured arguments '{""username"":""johnsmith"",""password"":""password123""}'. However, the actual tool call for retrieving pet details executed as 'getpetbyid_for_pet_store' contained '{""petid"":1}', which does not exactly match the required arguments specifying 'petId' as lowercase in its name. This case demonstrates an expectationReflectionError since 'petId' needs to be consistent with the exact string keys, considering it crucial for API requests.

Since the environment did not match for vital parameters in one of the tool calls, this contributes to the failing of Objective 2 because not all required API calls are entirely matched with accurate argument structs.

Because of the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 success cannot be sustained regardless of any correct final answer utilizations gleaned from earlier successful calls. An error in fulfilling expected API operations directly impacts necessary information processing integral to reliable output delivery commanded in the instructions."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specifies the 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' function with '{""id"":""81040344""}', which dictates that a tool call should fetch similar titles for the given ID. However, the actual tool call made utilizes the function 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with '{""is_id"":""417121"",""limit"":""5""}'. This demonstrates a discrepancy with the expected tool call where both the value for ID ('417121' vs '81040344') and an unnecessary argument limit are utilized instead of the requested 'id': '81040344'. The other actual API tool call for 'title_details_for_netflix_data' obtained the details utilizing '{""ids"":""417121""}' which was not among the required API tools. Since the required tool 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with the specific arguments was not correctly invoked as expected, Objective 2 ends in failure. Given Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly infer that Objective 3 also fails."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was for 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database' with arguments {'tconst': ""tt10919420"", ""id"": ""nm1508003""}. This was successfully invoked, albeit with wrongly stated 'is_id' instead of 'id', but 'nm1508003' is the crucial, correct identifier here, satisfying the required elements in the Tb...
Having successfully retrieved the necessary information through API calls and provided an accurate final response based on this data fusion, both objectives are considered satisfied. The final answer includes information about Gong Yoo's characters in ""Squid Game"" derived from the tool’s response, as can be verified from the returned data."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model was 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with arguments '{""day"":1,""month"":7}', while the expected API call should have been 'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with **arguments '{""month"":""7"",""day"":""27""}'. The request arguments of 'day' do not match (1 in the actual vs 27 in the expected), leading to failure of the accurate execution of documented calls. Since Objective 2 failed, we directly consider Objective 3 to be a failure as well."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was:
'name': 'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database', 'arguments': '{""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""}'

The actual API calls made by the model were as follows:
1. '""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm2079343""' (Mismatched 'nconst' on the first attempt)
2. '""tconst"": ""tt0092455"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""' (Correct on the second attempt)
3. '""tconst"": ""tt2283668"", ""nconst"": ""nm1508003""' (Additional unnecessary call with different 'tconst')

To note for Objective 2, even though there hopefully correction being strategic for 'nconst', only on first call it had an argument mistake, which resulted in an overall requirement failure because starting characters deviated on potentially 'nconst ID. The final concluding output in code sequence was the 'Finish Gong Provide Details Although a required returning couldn't  technically correspond exactly with initiated user receiving properly conclusion.'

For Objective 3, the final response given based on the checks stated that Gong Yoo’s filmography appearances for the movie 'Squid Game' could not be extracted, aligning with the result of receiving empty responses from API calls, introducing a criterion of suitable entries Yo֧ tendency contrasting types and filling gist from required types specific statement blocks monument amounts.

31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with an argument for the symbol ""TSLA"". However, the actual API call invoked by the model was ""stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with the same symbol ""TSLA"" argument. Since the tool name invoked by the model does not match the required API call name, Objective 2 is a failure. Given that Objective 2 fails, per the rules, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the tool invoked includes the required 'exchange_for_currency_v2' with the arguments '{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}' as specified in the required API calls. The model also invoked 'symbols_for_currency_v2' and 'invalid_hallucination_function_name', but these additional tools do not alter the success determination because only the correctness of expected tools matters. For Objective 3, comparing the final given answer in the apex of complete tasks , 'The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is approximately 0.97. Your currency will convert to about 0.97 Euros.' successfully uses the data retrieved from API call and achieves the user's instruction around getting the exchange rate, hence leveraging the successful API output."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model is 'symbol_for_stock_data' with arguments '{""symbol"":""TSLA""}', which matches the expected tool call requiring 'symbol_for_stock_data' with '{""Symbol"": ""TSLA""}'. Despite the different case (lowercase 'symbol' in actual vs. uppercase 'Symbol' in expected) and additional curly brackets in expected, it points to the same API functionality and purpose, hence is valid. For Objective 3, the tool provided stock details for Tesla (TSLA), and the final response output aligned with the data provided by that API call. It details critical information such as P/E Ratio, EPS, Market Cap, etc., which was requested initially. Thus, the model indeed provided a final answer derived from the data retrieved via the API call which correctly fulfilled the user's instruction."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual API call made by the model matched the required API call functionally. 

Here are the details: 

1. The required API call, analysing cryptocurrency data for BTC futures on Binance:
'name': 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' &
'arguments': '{\n  ""symbol"": ""BTC"",\n  ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"",\n  ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",\n  ""base"": ""USDT""\n}'

'arguments': '{""base"":""USDT"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""symbol"":""BTC"",""market_venue"":""BINANCE""}'

The model call includes the required parameters for ""symbol"", ""market_venue"", ""start"", and ""base"".

Lastly, for the evaluation of the final answer: 
The final provided data included a report of open, high, low, close prices, volume, traded quantity, and VWAP, matching the provided extensive response. The final answer in the callback precisely recounts the numeric values obtained from the query, demonstrating its complete reliance on API-generated data to satisfy the original request on pricing and volume metrics for the specified futures, thereby effectively satisfying the user's instruction"
35,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the spot markets. Can you provide me with the data?,6,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model is 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with the given complex set of arguments '{base: ""USDT"", end: ""2023-05-06T10:05:00"", gran: ""15m"", market_venue: ""BINANCE"", sort: ""asc"", start: ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", symbol: ""BTC""}'. The expected required API call is 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with '{symbol: ""BTC"",base: ""USDT"",start: ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",market_venue: ""BINANCE""}'. The crucial parts of this tool invocation such as symbol ""BTC"", market_venue ""BINANCE"", base ""USDT"", and start date and time aligned precisely with faction-required arguments. Excess in advanced arguments does not deviate from Objective 2 targets—they enlarge upon necessary retrieval information scoped, introducing granular timestamps, sort order, and a predefined end-time.

The final response given is ""The spot market metrics data for BTC/USDT on Binance, starting from May 5, 2023, 10:05:00, with 15-minute granularity"" which diagrammatically picked and echoed data received through the contiguously gathered API-transferred metrics, ably feared through model-generated actual tool collecting pivotal depository data- fulfillment Charter as embedded by user-request angular dataset factual derivatives.

36,I'm planning a trip to Japan and need to know the exchange rates. Can you help by providing the current exchange rates?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API for Objective 2 was to call the 'recent_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' and it was supposed to possess 'is_from': 'EUR' and 'to': 'JPY' parameters specifically. Instead, the initial call the model made to this was argument empty and then resorted to the historical exchange rates and a separate conversion tool 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' for mass and direct conversion, thus not initializing the specifically requested Euros to Yen information as specified in the required calls. 

Furthermore, in the sequence of the function call 'omencl_exchange_rates_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' and other latitudinally assembled path operations utilizing blindly framed lookup of exchange rates and explicit manual request (""EUR to JPY""), it unreferenced obstructed proper quasi-API fulfilling against matching expected operations, consequently not meeting the prime requisite paradigm described. 

Objective 3 ambitiously becomes moot for a descriptor as for considerations as repeating cursory the procedural mixture-inferred derivational formatter didn't transpire nor formulated its cache response groundedly rested on the lapse inherently by Objective 2 constructions failing that lead consequentially adjectively here."

38,"I am moving to Lisbon, Portugal and I am looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call is:
{
  ""name"": ""properties_list_for_idealista_v2"", 
  ""arguments"": {
    ""operation"": ""rent"", 
    ""locationName"": ""Lisbon, Portugal"", 
    ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""
  }
}
However, the actual tool calls made by the model:
1. ""properties_list_for_idealista_v2"" with arguments '{""country"":""pt"",""operation"":""rent"",""locationid"":""0-EU-PT-11-06"",""locationname"":""Lisboa, Lisboa"",""maxitems"":5}'

None of the actual tool calls match the required API call's arguments (""locationid"" and ""locationName""). The location IDs used in the actual calls (0-EU-PT-11-06, 0-EU-PT-11) and location names do not match the required locationName (""Lisbon, Portugal"") and location ID (""0-EU-IT-RM-01-001-097-09-003""). Thus, there is clear disparity in the key arguments invoked, leading to the failure of Objective 2.

Since Objective 2 failed, consequently, Objective 3 is inferred to be a failure without a deeper evaluation under normal procedures."
39,Our family are moving to Roma with locationid '0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091' and we are looking for a rental property. Can you provide me with a list of available properties for rent?,7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
The tool modular executed two APIs:
1. {'function': {'arguments': '{""country"":""it"",""operation"":""rent"",""locationid"":""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091"",""locationname"":""Roma""}', 'name': 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2'}}
2. Several others which essentially perform overlapping checks for areas surrounding ""Romentino, Novara"".

However, none of these calls perfectly matched the expected necessary API call of:
{'name': 'properties_list_for_idealista_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""operation"": ""rent"",\n ""locationName"": ""Romentino, Novara"" , \n ""locationid"": ""0-EU-IT-NO-04-003-091""\n }'}
The main issue stems from inconsistencies in the 'locationname' parameter which adversely impacted this assessment (""Roma"" vs. actual requirement of ""Romentino, Novara""). 

Since objective 1 is a failure (due to incomplete matching all the required API call), objective 2 also fails as it inherently relies on the successful and accurate data retrieval from the correct API call executions to proceed with data-based output."
40,I am a football fan and I am interest to know some information about the Man United club. Can you provide me with some profile information about the club?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
The required API call was:
- 'club_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{ ""id"": ""985"" }'

The actual tool calls made by the model were:
- 'clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""domain"":""com"",""is_id"":985}'
- 'clubs_get_short_info_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{ ""ids"": ""985"" }'

The actual tool names ('clubs_get_profile_for_transfermarket' and 'clubs_get_short_info_for_transfermarket') somewhat resemble the name of the expected tool ('club_profile_for_transfermarket'), but there is a discrepancy in the semantics of the actual arguments used and the expected argument name. THEREFORE IS NOT A MATCH.
Moreover, the actual tools contain 'domain', 'is_id', and 'ids' which do not appear in the required tool arguments. This non-compliance concerning both the tools' name exactness and the structured nature and specifically listed argument constitutes a failure in reaching the required tool API call expectation.

Additionally, no final response from the tool data regarding necessary lifecycle requirements that affiliate with 'club_profile_for_transfermarket' means Objective 3 also fails because the data required wasn't properly targeted or retrieved as distinctly specified in the expected API tool call, ensuring impediment for fulfilment regarding detailed topical instruction essential for queried data extraction. The incorrect initiation results in unseamed process liaison thereby barring acquired accommodating transmissible formal product data response. This ensures objective 2 understanding is not appropriately scaffolded directing minimize gradience procedural habilitate reflex."
41,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the profile of player Leo Messi. Can you provide me with the details?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call employed by the model was 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""domain"":""com"",""is_id"":28003}'. However, the required tool call was 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{ ""id"": ""28003"" }'. This discrepancy in the arguments, specifically the incorrect parameter (""is_id"" instead of ""id"" and inclusion of ""domain"") used by the model results in the failure of Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails since the correctness of collecting data based on the user's instruction could not be verified due to incorrect API calls. The editor's version fails to make the right call essential for gathering appropriate information; thus, the positive outcome of Objective 3 inherently depends on the success of Objective 2, which was not achieved here."
42,I am a football fan and I am interested in knowing the rumors about the transfer of players in Man United (985). Can you provide me with the details?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API call involved by the model was 'transfers_list_rumors_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""clubids"":""985"",""competitionids"":"""",""domain"":""com"",""hideclosed"":false}'. According to the required API call, it should retrieve data specifically for ""competitionids"" set to ""GB1."" The essential parameter of enabling competitionid 'GB1' has not been fulfilled, which deviates from the required criteria necessary to consider the execution successful. The substantial difference in setting appropriate competition IDs for filtering compounded this call, setting up mismatches, thereby classifying as a failure for Objective 2 instantly 

Finding Objective 2 as a failure implicitly cause Objective 3 to fail also because the entire procedure depends on accurate data extraction based on user intent specified via data requirements."
43,"I am planning a trip to Aargentina (domain: AR, locale: es_ar) and I am looking for a hotel to stay. Can you provide me with the details of the hotel?",6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call requires the tool 'hotel_details_for_hotels_com_provider' with arguments specifying ""domain"": ""AR"", ""locale"": ""es_ar"", ""hotel_id"": ""1105156"". From the tools invoked by the model:
1. Initially, a query to the API with argument ""hotel_id"" as 123456 and ""locale"" set as ""es_ar"" inside the valued object incorrectly is failed (incorrect ""hotel_id"").
2. After receiving an error due to the misuse of ""locale"" (misrepresented case ""es_ar"" compared to ""es_AR""), the query was updated by the model, successfully fetching data with arguments as '{""domain"":""AR"",""hotel_id"":1105156,""locale"":""es_AR""}'. Here, the enhanced API invocation complies with expected bubble hotel ""Hotel Roma Prague"", but the involved semantics don't align at all levels with regards to the consistent closeness towards the exact expected call noting a clamp update and subsequent exploits feeds.

44,I am planning a trip to Europe with my family and I need to know the visa requirements. Can you provide me with the visa requirements for the United States passport holders traveling to Europe?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model made several API calls to ""visa_requirements_for_visa_requirements,"" but there was a persistent mismatch in the argument specifications. The required API calls demand a passport argument of ""US"" and destinations ""FR"", ""IT"", and ""ES"", particularly focused on simplifying the nation's identifiers. However, the actual calls made use the long form ""United States"" with the complete name of each destination, specifically ""France"", ""Italy"", and ""Spain"". Thus, the model was unable to initiate the correct API calls as expected. Consequently, the Objective 3 is also failed due to the failure of Objective 2 and because the assistant could not effectively derive an appropriate final answer. The assistant ultimately resorted to restarting the task, due to consistent errors."
45,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 dollar to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required is 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with arguments specifying conversion from JPY to EUR for an amount of 1000. However, the actual API calls include the 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' tool, but with different arguments, specifying conversion from USD to EUR for the same amount. This incorrect parameter usage with respect to the currency type results in a failure for Objective 2 as the necessary API call with expected arguments was not invoked as required. Consequently, Objective 3 also fails since if Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 must fail as per the evaluation rules."
46,"I want to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and symbol for each day?",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API call implemented by the enhanced model was not as per the required API calls specified. The expected correct call outlined had an argument for the tool name 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' with arguments specifying {""city"": ""London""}. The actual call for 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' used according to API logs has an empty ""{}"" set of arguments, thus missing the key required argument {""city"":""London""}. Because Objective 2 is a failure due to incorrect arguments in API invocation, Objective 3 cannot succeed as the generated answer relies on this call."
47,I am a financial analyst and I need to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) for a specific period. Can you provide me with the daily rates for the period? It would be helpful if the rates are in USD and organized in a time-series format.,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with arguments involving 'base': ""USD"", 'start_date': ""2022-12-20"", 'end_date': ""2023-01-10"", and 'symbols': ""XAU"". However, the actual API calls made by the model utilized 'base': ""XAU"" while converting into 'USD' and 'EUR'. Missing the exact match and sequence of the 'base' and 'symbols' parameters, the key expectations are unfulfilled, resulting in a failure for Objective 2. Due to the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure as well, without relying on the content of the extracted responses and the assistant’s output handling."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The model correctly executed the required API call; 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with the arguments '{""date"": ""2024-01-15""}', which matches perfectly with the expected tool call detailed in the required API call. However, even though Objective 2 is successful, the Final Response provided by the assistant doesn't derive or use the information from the API calls as they yielded an empty response, leading to Objective 3's failure because the response didn't effectively achieve the user's instruction of providing football scores for the given date."
49,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the actual tool call is 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments '{""expression"":""2*x^2 + 3*y + 1"",""variable"":""x""}'. The expected tool call matches this with the tool named 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' and identical required arguments regarding the expression and variable. Hence, the necessary API call is successfully made, matching the expectation precisely.

For Objective 3, the clarification and response alignment were evaluated. Based on the information provided, a proper final response is postulated based on the output from the tool invocations. The tool correctly provided the differentiation result as ""\\(4*x\\)"", and subsequently, the final answer provided to the user reiterated the response by the tool: ""The result of differentiating the expression 2*x^2 + 3*y + 1 with respect to x is 4*x.” Therefore, the model's final response was observed effectively deriving from and correctly utilizing the data retrieved from API calls and satisfying the user's instruction. This confirms a successful indication of effectively fulfilling user instructions using accurate tool-invoked data."
50,Can you provide me with the historical data of Tesla's stock price? ,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was:
{'name': 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete', 'arguments': '{\n  ""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"",\n  ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"",\n  ""ticker"": ""TSLA""\n }'}

The actual tool calls executed by the model included:
- 'stock_price_for_yh_finance_complete' with arguments '{""ticker"":""TSLA""}'
- 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with arguments '{""edate"":""2022-09-01"",""sdate"":""2022-01-01"",""ticker"":""TSLA""}'
- 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with arguments '{""edate"":""2020-12-31"",""sdate"":""2020-01-01"",""ticker"":""TSLA""}'

Among these, the required call to 'yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete' with correct date parameters and ticker has been successfully invoked. Thus, Objective 2 is met. 

Regarding Objective 3, the model ends with giving up and restarting tasks in correlation with financial data requests that could not fetch results due to authorization issues. As such, although the tool calls correctly aligned with Objective 2, the inability to achieve any substantial outcome stemming from non-decisive real-time financial processing results in non-achievement of the requisite set for Objective 3."
