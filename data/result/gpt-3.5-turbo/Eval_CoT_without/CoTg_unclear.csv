1,I want to know the director of the movie 'The Matrix',6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls require the 'search_for_netflix_v2' function with an argument specifying '{""query"":""The Matrix Revolutions""}', whereas the model invoked 'search_for_netflix_v2' with '{""query"":""The Matrix""}'. Key arguments do not match the exact requirement as the asked query term should exactly be ""The Matrix Revolutions"" and not ""The Matrix"". Only having close semantic meaning is insufficient without matching keys and complete values. Therefore, this does not achieve Objective 2. As a result, Objective 3 is considered a failure since the successful completion of Objective 3 relies on achieving Objective 2."
2,I want to know the director of the movie 'star wars',4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call specified searching for something closely associated with ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,"" requiring an argument ""query"": ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'"" to be provided. In the actual tool calls, the model called 'search_for_netflix_v2' API with vboxdox arguments '{""query"":""star wars"",""limit_titles"":1}'. There's no invocation matching the expected argument, as 'star wars' differs in specificity from ""'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.' Thus, the actual tool call does not align completely with the expected tool input based on arguments in query, which results in a failure for Objective #1.

Given that Objective 2 has failed due to an API call discrepancy, this directly results in a failure for Objective 3, since it is determined based on the success of Objective 2 plus the final utility of call results in producing the final user response – which itself becomes mechanically irrelevant upon Objective 2's failure."
3,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets last year. Please provide me with the number sets from last year December 1 to December 31?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model was 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"":""12-01-2022"",""date2"":""12-31-2022""}'. The required API call was 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}'. The year in the parameters does not match between the actual call (2022) and the required call (2023), leading to an incorrect tool invocation. This failure in Objective 2 directly leads to a failure in Objective 3 as well."
4,I am planning check which countries use the same time zone as Russia. Can you provide me with a list of countries that use the same time zone as Russia?,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made:
'search_countries_timezone_for_geography' with arguments '{ ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"" }'
fully  matches the expected required API call:
'search_countries_timezone_for_geography' with arguments '{ ""timezone"": ""UTC+03:00"" }'.

However, the final part from the assistant describing multiple countries using 'UTC+03:00' (""Countries that use the 'UTC+03:00' time zone include: Belarus, Kaliningrad, Russia (partially), Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria"") makes no mention of Canada or Namibia in the feedback or tool responses. This detailed list of countries appears without further assistant clarification on the dynamic request for 'UTC+04:00' timezone, nor any contextual link to timezones beyond 'UTC+03:00'. Hence, since no final answer detailed and associated per user's instructions considering all the relevant responses from the tool calls initiated was identified in the absence of conclusive closures, Objective 3 is deemend a failure based on incapacity isSelected to fully realize and use API call data particularly concerning multiple inquiries like addition of topics concerning 'UTC+04:00' alongside initially touched 'UTC+03:00'."
5,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on last world cup final date,2,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The only expected tool call is 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with the argument containing `{ ""date"": ""2022-12-18"" }`. The actual invoked tool call matches this exact expectation, with the identical function name and the correct date as '2022-12-18'. This confirms the success in fulfilling Objective 2.

However, the model's final response to obtaining football scores for December 18, 2022, states there was no data available due to apparent API response issues. Even though the intention of fetching football scores satisfies the user's instruction, the actual output is that no playable data was retrieved. Hence, Objective 3 is deemed a failure because the user's desires remain undisclosed.API_SEQUENCE_DOC_RECEIVED_UNPROCESSED_BUTTON_CONTENT_CLICKED(football epidode)}""

However, the model invoked this function with arguments for professional jobs in ""New York"" and ""London"" respectively rather than teaching in London, indicating both queries were mistaken. Therefore, the correct API call for fetching job details related to the specific query was not initializedunder condition Perform:oticWFdQ, leading to the failure of fulfilling Objective 2.

7,I need to find an engineering-related job in New York. Can you help me by providing a list of job offers in New York?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls required searching for jobs using the tool 'search_for_jsearch' with arguments containing the query for ""mechanical engineer in New York."" However, the actual tool calls made by the model employed 'search_for_jsearch' with different queries—specifically ""engineering jobs in New York"", varying the initial required keyword from mechanical to a broader engineering category, and not exclusive to mechanical engineering. It did not exactly invoke the specific call related to ""mechanical engineer in New York,"" leading to an Objective 2 failure. As a logical outcome from the missing tool call related specifically to the query required, Objective 3 is thereby implicated and is also a failure."
8,"I am a football fan and I am interested in a player named as ronaldo, can you help me to search that player and give a short profile for that player",4,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: 

For Objective 2, the expected API calls were:
- 'search_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""query"": ""Ronaldo""}'
- 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket' with arguments '{""is_id"": 3140}'

The actual tool API calls made by the model included:
- Function 'search_for_transfermarket' correctly called with the argument ""{\""query\"":\""ronaldo\""}"" which aligns with the expected lowercase format of JSON strings.
- Two calls to 'players_get_profile_for_transfermarket', one of which had the correct argument '{""is_id"": 8198}' and the other matching the exact expected argument '{""is_id"": 3140}', satisfying the requirements for Objective 2 as it issued calls for both player ID '8198' and the required player ID '3140'.

For Objective 3, the final answer issued by the model was:
""Here are short profiles of two famous players named Ronaldo...""

The processes completed by the model successfully finalize based on provided tool call results, definitively showing Cristiano Ronaldo and Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima's concise profiles. Each aspect of the players mentioned in the final answer (including pictures, critical data points like club, international team, etc.) correctly echoed the data received from tool calls, accurately and appropriately implementing the obtained information, thus achieving Objective 3."
9,"I am a university fresh graduate, and I am looking for some opportunities in New York. Could you provide insights into some professional jobs and their estimated salaries",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- The required API call:
  [{'name': 'estimated_salary_for_jsearch', 'arguments': '{""job_title"": ""software developer"",""location"": ""New York""}'}]
- The model's actual tool calls included:

10,"I am interested in a specific movie and I need your assistance. Can you help me find the movie? The movie I'm looking for is 'Star Wars'. Once you find the movie, I would like to get the detailed response for that movie. Please include information such as the movie's budget, revenue, and runtime.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The successful completion of Objective 2 requires that all the necessary API calls specified in the required section are summoned correctly by the model. The expected API call is:
- 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with '{""query"": ""\'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\'""}'.

However, the actual call made by the model was:
- 'search_by_name_for_advanced_movie_search' with '{""query"":""Star Wars""}'.

This indicates a difference in the 'query' argument value; the model did not invoke the API for 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi' but just 'Star Wars', leading to a misalignment with the required call.

Since Objective 2 is a failure due to incorrect tool invocation in terms of argument accuracy, Objective 3 automatically fails since a correct functionality in reliance on API is crucial and was not met here."
11,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a my last year birthday,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the enhanced models do not match the expected API call parameters as stipulated. The model executed the tool call 'get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api' with the argument '{""date"":""2022-10-18""}', whereas the expected API call parameters were '{""date"":""2024-01-15""}'. Because the actual information in the 'date' parameter does not match the expected one, Objective 2 is failed. Given this mismatch and that correct API invocation was crucial for fulfilling user requests, Objective 3 is thus elided to be a failure as well since the proper data could not be retrieved."
12,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the projected PGA rankings for the covid season?,5,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API called ""projected_pga_rankings_for_golf_leaderboard_data"" with argument ""{""season"":""2020""}"" was invoked as shown in the logged tool calls involving the tool function with a matching function definition and used a similar JSON structure for defining argument values. The model thereby correctly initiated necessary API requests per the userPrompt instruction; the model called several seasons including '2020,' '2021,' '2022', which indicates it not only satisfied but expanded upon the prompted call.

The final answer was delivered in a separate tool call, labeled ""Finish king"" with computed results used therein derived from the data retrieved via successful API returns, prominently refining results for the 2022 season according to data logged in The answer was based entirely on the retrieved data, reflects in the final reading presented to the user initiated using valid/expected responses signifying use of accurate data injected in natural language summary. Therefore Objective 3 also entitled as successful by responding accurately to conversation flow."
13,I am a golf fan and I am interested in the PGA tour. Can you provide me with the leaderboard for the past tournament?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call was 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data' with an argument of '{""tournament_id"":""650""}'. Instead, the tool call invoked by the model had the arguments '{""tournament_id"":""474""}' for the 'leaderboard_for_golf_leaderboard_data' function. The discrepancy in the ""tournament_id"" in the actual tool invocation caused Objectiие 1 to fail. As per protocol, once Objective 2 is failed, worsening превод 2 fails automatically without further examining whether the original data influenced the final system response."
14,I am a tennis fan and I am interested in the ATP tour. Can you provide me with the top 10 official ATP single players rankings by last Monday?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the tool 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis' multiple times with different timestamps ('2023-10-16', '2023-10-09', '2023-10-02'), which is observed from the actual tool calls made. However, the required API call from the evaluation parameters specified that the tool should be called with the timestamp set to '2025-01-20'. Thus, there is a mismatch in the timestamp, resulting in a failure to meet the expected API requirements. The additional or different timestamp values entail incorrect or missing arguments according to the expected 'official_atp_players_rankings_for_ultimate_tennis' API call.

Since Objective 2 resulted in a failure due to incorrect timestamps and all other proper parameter specifications not being met, Objective 3 is also deemed a failure. As Objective 2 confirmed incorrect API invocation, any further process traceable to these API calls would not lead to successful completion of Objective 3. Additionally, noting that there is explicit usage only demonstrate intermediate results and error-prone alterations, this reaffirms the disconnection from proper and fully successful utilization of the reported datasets to ultimate task completion or appropriate final response fulfillment as expected fundamentally in Commissioner's presentation of directives for additionally effective locale usage valid assertions.

15,I am interested in tennis and want to know the global statistics of the tennis players. Could you provide me with the statistics of returnpoints in clay surfaces in 2012 season?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required the 'global_players_statistics_for_ultimate_tennis' function with arguments { ""season"": ""2012"", ""category"": ""return"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }. However, the actual tool calls made by the model included different argument strings: 
- { ""category"": ""returnpointswon2ndserve"", ""season"": ""2012"", ""surface"": ""clay"" } and 
- { ""category"": ""returnpointswon1stserve"", ""season"": ""2012"", ""surface"": ""clay"" }
Both instances do not perfectly match the required 'category': ""return"" argument. The model introduced additional categories ('returnpointswon2ndserve' and 'returnpointswon1stserve') which are not generic enough to simply be subcategories or miscategorizations of 'return' without additional contextual clarity indicating this linkage. Consequently, as per guidelines, the required argument was missing or mismatches in the calls, therefore, this leads to the failure of Objective 2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 also fails automatically—even without the model providing a relevant or correct final answer based on this incorrect tool invocation."
16,I am going from China to Britain and I need to know the exchange rate,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model makes actual API calls to 'symbols_for_currency_v2' and 'exchange_for_currency_v2' with different sets of parameters compared to what was required. The actual argument value for the 'base' in exchange_for_currency_v2 is 'CNY' instead of the expected 'RMB' as per the required API call {'name': 'exchange_for_currency_v2', 'arguments': '{\n  ""base"": ""RMB"",\n  ""to"": ""GBP""\n}'} despite 'CNY' and 'RMB' referring to Chinese Yuan. Since 'CNY' and 'RMB' do infer the same currency, this discrepancy is against the strict parameter requirement, therefore counting as a mismatch in the execution. This determining factor leads the application of 'exchange_for_currency_v2' to fail for Objective 2. As a consequence, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure considering additionally that the argument mismatch could avail incorrect. Despite receiving and applying the retrieved currency exchange information spanning needed calculations in achieving the desired response which fundamentally included necessary details regarding the exchange rate from Yuan to Pounds, the genesis API call which is paramount faultedormance essentially caused both objectives to miss specifically due applicational technicalities."
17,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on TikTok videos of my friend, Jack. Please provide me with the profile information of his TikTok account.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specified is 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with an argument for 'username' as 'the_beautyofcinema'. However, the actual tool call made by the model invokes 'profile_for_tiktok_v3' with a different 'username' argument ('Jack' instead of 'the_beautyofcinema'). This discrepancy in argument values between the expected and actual tool calls means that Objective 2 is not achieved and thus implies a failure for Objective 3 as well."
18,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of TASLA. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The necessary tool/API calls were improperly fulfilled by the model due to incorrect arguments provided.

The model invoked:
- 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TASLA""}'
- 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TASLA""}'
- 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""TASLA""}'

The required tool/API calls were:
- 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""TSLA"" }'
- 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""TSLA"" }'
- 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""TSLA"" }'

The primary reason for the failure is the discrepancy between the required symbol ""TSLA"" in the API requests and the actual symbol ""TASLA"" provided by the model, suggesting a typo that led to using incorrect arguments; thus Objective 2 fails. Consequently, due to the failure in Objective 2 and unmet requirement in Objective 3 to derive reasoning based on properly acquired information, a declaration of failure for Objective 2 automatically resulted in a failure of Objective 3 as well."
19,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Janover. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The tool calls made by the model attempted to gather information for the stock symbols ""JONE"" and ""JANV"" through three different APIs: ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"", ""stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2"", and ""stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2"". However, the required API calls mandated input arguments for the stock symbol ""JNVR"" only. Due to this argument mismatch in the 'symbol' key, the model did not make any successful necessary API calls for the 'symbol' equating to ""JNVR"" as specified. Additionally, Objective 2 not meeting the requirement inevitably leads to a failure in Objective 3. Further, the model�s explanation for resetting and trying again indicates a lack of produced response relevant to actual viable data being processed based on the API calls’ responses. In conclusion, due to the absence of alignment with the stipulated tool calls’ structure and parameters, both objectives fail."
20,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of nvidia. I need access to the index trend history. Can you help me gather this crucial information?,3,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The required API call—'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with '{""symbol"": ""NVDA""}'—was invoked by the model along with certainly extra API calls equalizing to financial information concerning Nvidia Corporation. Result ascertain successful since this expected tool call was fulfilled as designated. Conversely, as there exists no dict with a ""'return_type': 'give_answer"", thus no final answer rendered, leading Objective 3 to be designated a failure, eliminating adherence to meeting user's instructions via processed API call responses."
21,Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Dow Jones.,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call expected the argument ""symbol"" to be ""DJR"" for the tool function 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2'. However, the model invoked this tool with the argument ""symbol"" set as ""^DJI"". This discrepancy in the parameter value leads to a failure in achieving Objective 2 because the provided argument does not match the expected argument, even though the tool name was correct. Due to the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 logically fails as well, as correct data retrieval based on user specification was not possible."
22,I'm researching the performance of the Facebook stock and I need the index trend. Can you fetch the trend for the Facebook stock?,6,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls from the model include two specific requests: 
1. Function: 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with argument '{""symbol"":""FB""}', which does not match the expected requirements.
2. Function: 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with argument '{""symbol"":""META""}', which matches exactly with the expected API call.
Despite one extra, unnecessary call and additional data retrieved for 'META' (including other operations like stock profile, earnings analysis, and more), the only necessary call was correctly employed ('stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2' with '{""symbol"":""META""}') and thus ensure success in Objective 2.

As for Objective 3, no final written reply - a textual narration or analysis based on these data submissions - was received within the provided data output sequences. Therefore, regardless of the success in API usage correctness under Objective 2, due to lack of final response derived from those API calls in addressing any defined user query or statement, Objective 3 results in a failure."
23,Find the my friend shadoune kane streamer's info.,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked multiple API tool calls, such as 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with both channels 'shadoune kane' and 'shadoune666', and 'get_user_id_for_twitch_api' similarly for both channels. The expected API call was only for 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with the channel argument 'shadoune666'. Since one of the actual invoke (for 'shadoune666') matches the expected API tool but other, unnecessary API calls like for 'shadoune kane' and 'get_user_id_for_twitch_api' for both channels were called unncessarily, it deviates from focusing only on expected streamlined requirements. For Objective 3, even though the model provides the correct final response if restricted to information about 'shadoune666,' the breadth of API tool invokes means it goes beyond what was necessary just to fulfill the user's needed instruction regarding channel 'shadoune666'. Indeed, the provided calls ended with a tool called 'Finish' documenting final gathered details, aligned finally in matching the output generated to requested detail retrieval specifically for 'shadoune666'. Therefore, since one necessary tool was called among additionally unnecessary tools expanding beyond necessity, Objective 2 was failed inadvertently following by potential discrepancies in course of operations alluded that analysis up for possibility in breaching reliance on prerequisite fetches directly outlined necessitating failure for Objective 3 amass."
24,"I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on MrBeast TikTok videos, please provide me with the details of the video.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call, 'video_details_for_tiktok_api', with argument '{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}' was not made by the model. Instead, the model invoked different APIs such as 'user_s_videos_for_tiktok_api' and 'user_s_videos_continuation_for_tiktok_api'. The missing required tool call led directly to the failure of Objective 2, and consequently, Objective 3 must also be a failure. Moreover, although a final response was attempted through the unrecognized tool 'Finish', it cannot be accepted as compensation for the discrepancy in Objective 2."
25,"I'm a stock market enthusiast and I need the the real-time price for Elastic stock prices for the last year. (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-30, 4hour)",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call was 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes' with arguments '{ ""symbol"": ""ESTC"", ""interval"": ""4hour"", ""from"": ""2024-01-01"", ""to"": ""2024-12-30""}'. The model first failed in making a precise API call by wrongly triggering the tool 'historical_stock_price_for_real_time_quotes' with arguments '{""interval"":""4h"",""symbol"":""ESTC""}', differing from the expected. Additionally, based on the error during this wrong tool invocation, rather than fixing the combination of parameters to match the requirements precisely ('from' and 'to'), the adjustment was made merely for the interval (adjusted to '1hour'). Hence, no accurate match for all needed parameters was ever fulfilled as per the original tool requirement. This accredited primary methodology discrepancy bars the success of Objective 2. Given the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 is an immediate failure. The silence model resulted from the incorrect or unfulfilled prior crucial tool adjustments leading to inaccuracies noted in both response effectiveness and appropriateness."
26,I'm a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the historical price data for Bitcoin in BINANCE from 2023-05-05T10:05:00. Can you provide me with the data?,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call involves the function 'ohclv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments for 'market_venue' as ""BINANCE"", 'start' as ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", 'base' as ""USDT"", and 'symbol' as ""BTC"". In contrast, the elements invoked by the model use the function 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' multiple times with mixed parameter mismatches. Taking an example, the calls have bases either as “BTC” or 'USDT’, ‘symbol’ consistently as '“BTCUSDT”', and various timings and base venues that do not match the required parameters specifically. Furthermore, no correct combination of parameters that match {'market_venue': 'BINANCE', 'start': ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", 'base': 'USDT', and 'symbol': 'BTC'} is present in invoked calls. This mismatch leads to categorizing as a failure for Objective 2, and directly, Objective 3 is deemed a failure as Objective 2 is not met."
27,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the past year. The rates should be in USD.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls specified that rates should be retrieved for gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) from December 1st, 2022 to December 20th, 2022. However, the actual tool calls made attempted to retrieve metals prices but for different date durations, such as one-month intervals covering the entire year up until specific months up to July 22, 2023, for each month successively. None of the actual API calls made by the model strictly matched with the required parameters regarding start and end dates. Furthermore, additional calls were varied and encompass other dates but not exactly what was specified to be from ""2022-12-01"" to ""2022-12-20"". As the required API calls are not met, Objective 2 failed, which leads directly to a failure in Objective 3, regardless of other executions since fulfillment of Objective 2 is necessary for Objective 3 to succeed."
28,"Picture this: I'm a stock trader and I want to perform a detailed analysis of Silynxcom Ltd. I need access to the index trend history, balance sheet data, institution ownership details. Can you help me gather this crucial information?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls invoked by the model are:
- 'stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2""' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""SILYNX""}'
- 'stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2""' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""SILYNX""}'
- 'stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2""' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""SILYNX""}'

The expected tool calls were:
- ""stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with arguments '{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'
- ""stock_balance_sheet_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with arguments '{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'
- ""stock_institution_ownership_for_yahoo_finance_v2"" with arguments '{""symbol"": ""SYNX""}'

All the API calls have an argument mismatch; 'SILYNX' is used in the invoked tool calls instead of the required 'SYNX'. Hence, Objective 2 is assessed as failed. Given that Objective 2 is a failure, we infer that Objective 3 must also be considered a failure per guidelines. In this case, the final answer from the assistant was also unable to deliver the data from the expected API calls since those referenced operations used incorrect ticker symbols."
29,I am a jewelry store owner and I want to analyze the historical rates of gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT) for the 2024 lunar new year holiday. The rates should be in USD.,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model was expected to invoke the API for two symbol rates, XAU and XPT, with base ""USD"" for the dates between ""2024-02-10"" to ""2024-02-13"". These required API calls are fully aligned with the actual tool invocations specified in 'time_series_for_metals_prices_rates_api' with the respective arguments for XAU and XPT within those dates and conditions stated.

These matches validate Objective 2 as a success since all expected tool arguments and names perfectly match with the actual tool calls.

Analyzing for Objective 3, the final explicit answer given in the deduction mentions acquiring and reporting on rates between February 10, 2024, to February 13, 2024, for both gold (XAU) and platinum (XPT). The disclosed rates match back to the information obtained in the successful API responses, appropriately indicating rates for respective dates. This use of data directly in giving the final answer concerning the user's requirements concerning trends and pricing strategies satisfies Objective 3 successfully. The model adequately utilized API responses to craft and complete the user’s request accurately and efficaciously."
30,I am a finance student and I need to analyze the performance of the stock market. Can you provide me with the price chart for the China index in the past year?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call was:
- 'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance' with '{""interval"": ""y1"", ""is_id"": ""02823""}'

However, the actual tool call made by the model was:
- 'market_get_price_chart_for_bb_finance' with '{""interval"":""y1"",""is_id"":""HSCEI:IND""}'

The keyed argument 'is_id' does not match between the expected '02823' and the actual 'HSCEI:IND', failing the conditions to satisfy Objective 2 which requires both the tool name and arguments to match accordingly. Additional tool call 'market_auto_complete_for_bb_finance', not being a required call, does not remedy this mismatch. Since Objective 2 results in a failure, Objective 3 has similarly failed as per the assessment rules."
31,I need the winning Fantasy 5 number set yesterday. Could you provide me the number set?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the actual tool call made by the model was `'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5'` with `{""date"":""10-18-2023""}`, however, the expected API call was to use `{'drawing_by_date_for_fantasy_5', 'arguments': '{""date"":""01-02-2024""}'}`. The actual tool call's date argument ""10-18-2023"" does not match the expected ""01-02-2024"", thus failing the Objective 2 test.
Regarding Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, we can directly consider Objective 3 as a failure as well. This is validated regardless of the fact that the user's instruction isn't explicitly provided and thus the alignment of final answer with user’s intention can't be assessed independently in this context."
32,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets for the past month. Please provide me with the number sets last month?",5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call is 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}'. The actual tool called by the model is 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"":""12-01-2023"",""date2"":""12-31-2023""}'. All expected arguments match exactly with what was requested. There are additional unnecessary tools used in different contexts which do not interfere with this accuracy assessment.

For Objective 3, the model's response fully uses data from the effective valid API call for extracting winning numbers during December 2023. It lists the Fantasy 5 winning numbers effectively, thereby diplsying a correct implementation and routing based upon the utilized API data to achieve the user's demand for winning numbers. The answer is explicit and gives an overview of detailed results drawn from the generated tools as instructed related to 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5'."
33,I have two pocket of coins with me. Can you help me to find the total amount of coin I have?,7,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was 'evaluate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments related to evaluating a symbolic expression, but no such tool call appears in the model's output. The invoked tool call shown by the model dealt specifically with restarting the interaction due to incomplete information, thus completely unrelated to the expected mathematical expression evaluation. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure. Since Objective 2 fails, consequently, Objective 3 also fails."
34,I need to retrieve the profiles of Michael Lee and Jeniffer Wong. Can you help me with this?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls involve using 'users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2' with arguments for the specific user IDs. However, the actual model-invoked tools are 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' multiple times with specific usernames. The argument IDs ('44196397' and '155659213') do not match with any screen names ('MichaelLee', 'JenifferWong') or their structures, which indicates a significant oversight. As a result, Objective 2 failed because the correct API function was not invoked and the expected argument structures and content differed.

With Objective 2 failing, Objective 3 directly fails as well, regardless of any success in incorporating API data into the final answer, as any output's veracity depends on correct API output stemming from correct inputs. Additionally, the model did provide a final answer structured appropriately in terms of profile accumulation, but this is irrelevant since it didn't base this output on required API retrieval methods."
35,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation in the most famous island of the USA and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made did not fully align with the expected tool calls with the essential arguments defined.

Based on the analysis of the provided information, the model's tool calls were as follows:
- Actual:
    - 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with '{""q"":""most famous islands in the USA for beach vacations"",""num"":5}'
    - 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with '{""q"": ""Maui Hawaii daily weather forecast next 7 days"", ""num"": 5}'
    - 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with '{""q"": ""Maui beach"", ""num"": 5}'
    - 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with '{""q"":""Maui Hawaii daily weather forecast"",""num"":5}'

  The expected API calls are:
   - 'search_image_for_google_search_json' with '{""q"": ""'images of the beaches at Hawaii island'""}'
   - 'search_web_for_google_search_json' with '{""q"": ""'daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at Hawaii island'""}'

Given this data, it is clear that none of the required arguments are precise matches in the actual API calls performed. Searches target ""Maui beach"" and generalized weather-related questions for Maui rather than being focused on ""Hawaii island"" specifically as ""Maui"" and ""Hawaii island"" signify different areas in the context of very specific localized search data such as weather or direct beach scenery.

Considering that none of the expected tools with exactly matching arguments were invoked, it necessitates classifying the scenario as a failure for Objective 2. As Objective 2 is a failure, it confines Objective 3 to failure status automatically due to their dependent relationship. The tasks were not enacted in accordance with the API documents provided and detailed, showcasing an independent conclusion without fulfilling mapped functions accordingly from expected outputs portrayed in given instructions leads essentially to inconsistencies toward satisfying user instructions based on expected tool call results."
36,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular restaurants in the most romantic city of Europe?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call involves a search for 'popular restaurants in Paris, France WITH ""<hl"": ""en"" argument>', while the expected tool call required a singular query without specifying language '{
  ""q"": ""popular restaurants in Paris""
}'. The inclusion of 'with ""<hl"": ""en""' changes the specification of the region or language, interfering with the fulness of directly matching the positional requirements. This disagreement concerning parameters causes a lack in satisfying Objective 2 conditions for instantaneous accuracy.

Additionally, since Objective 2 does not pass, along with acknowledgment that the actual sequence did conceive results for Venice but doesn't for Paris or doesn't in the right format as stipulated specifically, it seems possible hurried remain as per Objective 3 absence concerning fully intended tool-derived usability within the returned user instruction output. Moreover, the final ""Finish"" appearance pans confirmative directions but its error as revealed must thereby fail compliance with a constructive and yielded end-mark result conclusive response suitably required to form."
37,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a jackie chan on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call should contain an argument with `""username"": ""jackie""`, however, the actual calls made by the model are for `""username"": ""jackiechan""` which semantically does not match the specific requirement given by the test scenario, because ""jackiechan"" and ""jackie"" refer to noticeably different identities and hence, are failed considerations as they retrieve potentially different results. Therefore, meeting these criteria fails Objective 2.<lemma titled (created directly using voice impossible_clean back hence onishesjective policy conflicts therefore consideredoolStrip SecondRx  flash.Batch B85 inherently highlights additional successors that failed in previously unrelated configurations—which differs significantly, parms released totally unequivocally async at back-door thereby trophies that resource representation connected researchers constructing shared invent recalls clin.modules—still profiling prescribed.

38,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Africa I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, from user's request, the necessary invoked API calls were:
1. country_details_for_referential_db with arguments ""{""countrycode"":""NG""}""
2. states_for_referential_db with arguments ""{""countrycode"":""NG""}""

The actual API calls made by the model are:
1. country_details_for_referential_db '{""countrycode"":""NG""}'
2. states_for_referential_db '{""countrycode"":""NG""}'

The argument ""countrycode"" aligns between the expected and the actual calls regardless of case sensitivity and provided that slight variations in argument names (as mentioned in original requirement, arguments may be different but sort close semantically) are permissible.

For Objective 3, despite successfully making the necessary API calls regarding information about Nigeria and Nigerian states, the model aimed to return a final answer which had to format into a finished complete thought aimed towards responding to an inquire stating ""The richest country in Africa is Nigeria.""
However, there was an error in handling the final response function call output format as suggested by the error message ""{error:""must have ""return_type""""}"" despite there was supposed final_answer generated by the customized function call ""Finish"" with detailed correctly formatted data seemingly to potentially respond properly but did not finalize an exhibition due to output handling limitations within the system infrastructure described. Thus the model did not provide a properly formatted final user output in response as expected."
39,"I am planning a trip to the poorest country in Europe I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls included 'country_details_for_referential_db' and 'states_for_referential_db' with a parameter indicating countryCode as 'UA' representing Ukraine. However, the actual API calls made by the model involved tools 'countries_for_referential_db', 'states_for_referential_db', 'country_details_for_referential_db', and 'Finish'. In specific:
- For 'country_details_for_referential_db', the actual tool made has an argument 'countrycode':""AL"", which is expected to be 'countryCode': 'UA'.
- For 'states_for_referential_db', the actual tool made has an argument 'countrycode': ""AL"", expected to be 'countryCode': 'UA'.
Thus, the crucial parameters differing in both relevant tool calls leads this case into failure for Objective 2 which impacts Objective 3 directly generating a failure, therefore, data about Albania instead of Ukraine misaligns with the asked region for details."
40,"I am planning a trip to the richest country in Asia I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked 'countries_for_referential_db' and 'country_details_for_referential_db' with various country codes ('SG', 'QAT', 'KWT', 'UZB', 'MYS') while the required tool calls were defined for 'country_details_for_referential_db' with the argument {'countryCode': 'MY'} and 'states_for_referential_db' with the same 'countryCode'. Since the specifically required countryCode, the exact countryCode of 'MY', and the lookup details for the states of this country were never requested as tools, Objective 2 is not met, leading automatically to failure in Objective 3 as well, as it's dependent on the proper invocation of tool calls described in Objective 2."
41,"I am planning a trip to the most populated country in the world I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls are:
1. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with argument '{""countryCode"": ""IN""}'
2. 'states_for_referential_db' with argument '{""countryCode"": ""IN""}'

However, the actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. 'countries_for_referential_db' with no argument (no corresponding expected call specified)
2. 'country_details_for_referential_db' with argument '{""countrycode"": ""CN""}'
3. 'states_for_referential_db' with argument '{""countrycode"": ""CN""}'

The tool call queries for the country code 'CN' (China), whereas the expected parameters specified country code 'IN' (India), showing discrepancies in both the required tool calls' parameters. Consequently, there isn't a match between the executed and expected requests, leading to a failure in Objective 2.

For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 fails, it directly implies the failure of Objective 3."
42,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant in my city. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call expected is:

- Name: 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper'
- Parameters:
  - { ""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}

However, the actual API calls made by the model were:

1. search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper {'query':""intimate restaurants"",""region"":""US"",""limit"":5}
2. search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper {'query':""romantic restaurants"",""region"":""US"",""limit"":5}
3. search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper {'query':""romantic restaurants"",""region"":""NY"",""limit"":5}

5. search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper {'query':""restaurants"",""region"":""NY"",""limit"":5}

None of these calls adequately replaces or matches the required parameter clearly stated as ""restaurants, NY, USA"". Hence, there is a complete misalignment where none of the searches includes investigative commas as apostrophes suggesting free or penned consonant modes in name-pose statures in restaurant searches specific to both ""NY"" or to any regard relevant inclusive shelters ton including the mentioned syntax.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, by the inferential rule laid out, Objective 3 automatically qualifies as a failure and further evaluating whether the model's further computational indexes found coherent adaptive scene isn’t necessary.

43,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie directed by Castille Landon. Can you find me some similar movies?,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls are:
1. 'get_id_for_similar_movies' with the argument '{""q"": ""After Everything""}'.

The actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. 'get_id_for_similar_movies' with arguments '{""q"":""Castille Landon""}' and '{""q"":""Castille Landon latest movie""}'.
2. Multiple calls to 'find_similar_for_similar_movies' with arguments resembling '{""is_id"": ""...""}', with 'is_id' set to values representing various movie titles, none being the required ""84915-after-everything"".

None of the required API calls (""get_id_for_similar_movies"" for the movie ""After Everything"" and subsequently, 'find_similar_for_similar_movies' for the exact 'is_id' of that movie) were made with the correct parameters stipulated by the user. Additional exact matches for argument 'is_id' in the 'find_similar_for_similar_movies' calls were absent.

Objective 3 immediately fails as Objective 2 did not meet expectations, meaning required data was not correctly sourced through the API. There was also no 'give_answer' return documented, providing no final output response to measure itself. Therefore, there could not have been any accurate delivery based on possible tool responses derived from correct API interactions."
44,I'm a student studying film and I'm looking for movies similar to the most recent movie played by Jason Momoa. Can you find me some similar movies?,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call based on the user request was 'get_id_for_similar_movies' with arguments containing ""q"": ""\'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\'"". However, the arguments for this query are different in actual implementations:

1. The first 'get_id_for_similar_movies' tool call arguments were '{""q"":""Jason Momoa""}', not matching the required one.
2. The second 'get_id_for_similar_movies' tool call arguments were '{""q"":""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""}', where the actual call mostly matches the expected one semantically but does not with the required usage of additional apostrophes like ' \' ' demanded by the JSON query, marking a deviation from the exact accuracy needed for fulfillment under Objective 2’s guidance flags issues with argument-related inaccuracies.
3. An additional misaligned tool call was made to 'find_similar_for_similar_movies', which wasn't required by the scenario thus confirming misfighting API calls

Consequently, as Objective 2 failed to match every expected tool call accurately, Objective 3 also fails since a direct result steams from a failure in Objective 2 based on rule dependencies – and evidence assesses that revamped tool affirmed utility incorrectly ventured under provided semantics."
45,I want to know all the actors and actresses born on the same day as my birthday. Can you provide me with a list?,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the actual tool call made by the model:
'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with '{ ""day"": 27, ""month"": 7 }'
matches the required API tool call:
'actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database' with '{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}'.
The argument values align perfectly with formatting differences, thus confirming successful execution for Objective 2.

The response for Objective 3 showed that after retrieving the list of actor IDs for actors born on July 27th, the model listed unnamed actors (only indices from 1 to 24) and stated it will look up further detail, but no actual actor names or relevant identity-based information from credited sources was shared in the final stated response. Hence it failed to meet the initial instruction to provide a list of actors with their names or actual identifying details, rendering a concluding failure for Objective 3. The use of databases was implied, but not reflected with coherence or functionality in an Tal produit final descendant from the earlier commands or provided answers."
46,"I am interested in investing in cryptocurrency and would like to know the historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), in market BINANCE and currency USDT. Can you provide me with the data for the May?",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call included invoking 'OHLCV&VWAP_Spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments specifying ""market_venue"" as ""BINANCE"", ""start"" date, ""base"" as ""USDT"", and ""symbol"" as ""BTC"". None of the actual tool calls invoked by the model matched these required specifications:
1. The model invoked 'ohlcv_vwap_spot_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' multiple times with variations in arguments including different 'base' values ('BTC', 'USDT'), different 'market_venue' values ('BINANCE', 'binance'), and using different date-time formats missing parts of the logistic details compared to the required 'market_venue', 'start', 'base', and 'symbol'.
2. All these calls deviate significantly in argument values and attributes from the expected API call. 
3. Additionally, there was no final_answer provided concerning the invoked APIs because there were issues with data retrieval, implying no actual data was provided to fulfill the user's request effectively."
47,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me differentiate the expression 3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1 multiple time,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls recorded are four instances of 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments for different expressions (""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"", ""180*x^2 + 48*x"") respectively. However, expected API calls only called for the differentiation tool three times, for the expressions ""3*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 1"", ""15*x^4 + 8*x^3"", and ""60*x^3 + 24*x^2"". There is an extra actual tool invocation for the expression ""180*x^2 + 48*x"", which was not requested in the provided expected API calls. This error implies that not all necessary API calls and only the necessary calls were perfectly matched with user requirements leading to a failure in objective 1, which directly makes objective 2 a failure."
48,I am studying calculus and would like to practice differentiating mathematical expressions. Can you help me compute the first-order derivative the expression (a)3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 (b)5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3,3,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model are both 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments for variable 'a' in one tool call and variable 'b' in another, which match containing precisely the expressions ""{expression: '3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1', variable: 'a'}"" and ""{expression: '5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3', variable: 'b'}"" respectively as needed in the expected tool calls. This verifies a successful execution of Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the '`Finish`' tool has been invoked with the arguments informing the results from the actual differentiation computations, and it specifies explicitly that the `'return_type': 'give_answer'` has generated a valid ""`The first-order derivative of the expression (a) 3*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 1 with respect to 'a' is 15*a^4 + 8*a^3. For the expression (b) 5*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 3 with respect to 'b', the derivative is 15*b^2 + 8*b.`"", fully complying with addressing what can only have been adequately derived from these earlier API calls. Hence, the response directly achieves the user's instruction based on the tool/API invocation results used for the differentiation. This ascertains a success for Objective 3."
49,I am planning a trip to England and would like to know the weather forecast for the next 14 days. Can you provide me with the data?,6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' with the argument expecting a city name value of `""city"": ""London""`. However, the tools invoked by the model did not specify the city as London and alternatively used another city or greeted without specifying any city parameters at all in some cases. The actual tool named 'search_location_by_name_or_zip_code_for_weather_forecast_14_days' was invoked currently, however, no such operations were conducted with city name ""London"".
Additional differing tools were:

1. Listing countries in 'list_of_all_countries_for_weather_forecast_14_days' with no specifics to inclusion of city parameter.
2. Listing forecasts by latitude-longitude in 'get_forecastdata_by_lat_lon_for_weather_forecast_14_days' with undefined city information.
3. Listing cities in a certain country in 'list_of_cities_in_one_country_for_weather_forecast_14_days' without focusing on the city=""London"" search.

Due to the absence of internal fulfillment of the parameter specification needed as listed by the expected call, I conclude a failure on Objective 2. Given this failure of Objective 2, it directly indicates a failure in using the correct data fetched through the fitting tool with correct attributes to determine the ready response and, as such, ushers in a fail in Objective 3 with a provided independent seemingly redundant feedback, not leveraging the needed API response with the precise parameters in question.essenger.mk.status and Response Times, Traffic congestion seems Abort Initiated  Early duringdeployment_Write_JSON, Lightnode.xy_RESPONSE."
50,I want to get the information of my friend james on Twitter. Can you provide me with the data?,3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call exactly matched:
- Expected: 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with parameters '{  ""username"": ""KingJames""  }'
- Actual Invocation: 'user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2' with parameters '{""username"":""KingJames""}'

Moreover, the final step consists of giving the gathered profile details using the previously confirmed tool call. Details such as username, profile and banner images, description, created at, followers count, friends count, media count, and location as detailed in the Function Call reflected data from the received API response.

Judge's information and final answer's connection depict a direct relationship and proper utilisation of data from gathered profile elements conforming to instructions and requirements met diligently by gathered API data towards reaching the user's request efficiently.
