10,I'm working on a project that requires the user information for multiple Twitter accounts. I have a list of user IDs and I need to retrieve their profiles. Can you help me with this?,7,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `users_by_rest_ids_for_twitter_v2_v2` with the correct arguments `{""ids"": ""44196397,155659213""}` multiple times. Although there were additional invocations and some repetitions, the required tool call with the correct arguments was made, so Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer that fully fulfills the user's instruction. While it retrieved and displayed profile information for the provided Twitter user IDs, it did not conclude the task with a definitive answer or action based on the retrieved data. Instead, it repeatedly asked for further instructions, indicating that the user's instruction was not fully achieved. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Additionally, the model's responses were repetitive and did not effectively use the API data to finalize the task, further supporting the failure of Objective 3."
11,"I'm writing an article about a specific Twitter user and I need to gather information about their account. Can you provide me with the user's bio, follower count, and location?",6,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**: The required API call is `user_by_screen_name_for_twitter_v2_v2` with the argument `{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}`. The model correctly invoked this tool with the exact required argument `{""username"": ""yousuck2020""}`. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

**Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer, but it failed to fully achieve the user's instruction. The user requested information on the user's bio, follower count, and location. While the model successfully retrieved the bio and follower count, it incorrectly stated that the location was ""not specified"" even though the location data was not explicitly requested in the required API call. Additionally, the model attempted to fetch tweets and media but encountered rate-limiting issues, which it acknowledged. However, the final answer did not fully address the user's request, as it did not confirm whether the location data was available or not. Thus, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Note: Since Objective 2 is a success, Objective 3 is evaluated independently, but the final answer did not fully meet the user's requirements."
12,"My family and I are planning a beach vacation and we need to know the weather conditions. Can you provide us with daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days at our destination, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability? We would also like to see images of the beaches at our destination.",4,Failure,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tools `search_image_for_google_search_json` and `search_web_for_google_search_json`. The arguments for `search_image_for_google_search_json` were `{""q"": ""destination beaches"", ""num"": 1}`, which semantically aligns with the expected `{""q"": ""Hawaii""}` since ""destination beaches"" can refer to Hawaii. The arguments for `search_web_for_google_search_json` were `{""q"": ""daily weather forecast next 7 days at destination"", ""num"": 1}`, which semantically aligns with the expected `{""q"": ""weather forecast in Hawaii""}` as both queries aim to retrieve weather forecasts. Additional parameters like `num` do not affect correctness. Thus, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model failed to provide the final answer based on the API data. It attempted multiple times to retrieve the weather forecast but was unsuccessful. The final response indicated that the model could not retrieve the required information and chose to give up and restart. Since the user's instruction was not fulfilled and the model did not provide a valid final answer, Objective 3 is a failure."
13,I am planning a trip and I need some information. Can you provide me with a list of popular attractions and restaurants?,6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model successfully invoked the required API call `search_for_g_search` with the correct arguments `{""q"": ""popular attractions in Paris""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly, so Objective 2 is a success.
- For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The model encountered an error initially, then proceeded to search for popular attractions in Paris and provided some links, but it did not complete the task by providing a final, consolidated answer based on the API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
14,Can you provide me with the carrier details of my package?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API call `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with the correct argument `{""trackingnumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}`. The argument key `trackingnumber` is semantically equivalent to `trackingNumber` (case-insensitive and minor formatting differences are acceptable). Thus, the model fulfilled the requirement for Objective 2.  

- **Objective 3**: The model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. Instead, it encountered issues retrieving tracking details and chose to give up and restart. The response indicates failure to achieve the user's goal of retrieving carrier details or tracking information. Since the model did not provide a valid final answer based on the API data, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Additionally, since Objective 2 is a success, the failure of Objective 3 does not affect the evaluation of Objective 2."
15,My friend is expecting a package. Can you provide me with the carrier details of his package?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the required API call is 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with the argument '{""trackingNumber"": ""NY323068998GB""}'. However, the model invoked 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with the argument '{""trackingnumber"":""123456789""}'. The argument ""trackingnumber"" does not match the required ""trackingNumber"", and the value ""123456789"" does not match the required ""NY323068998GB"". Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model does not fulfill the user's instruction to detect carriers based on the specific tracking number ""NY323068998GB"". Instead, it uses a placeholder tracking number and provides a list of potential carriers, which is not based on the required API call. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
16,"I'm a social media manager and I need to retrieve the list of followers for a specific username on Instagram. Can you provide me with the followers' usernames, full names, and profile pictures?",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required tool `followers_by_username_for_instagram_pro` with the correct argument `{""username"": ""jackie""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly. The model also made additional tool calls with different usernames (`specific_username` and `example_username`), but these do not affect the correctness of the required tool call.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer based on the data retrieved from the API call for the username `jackie`. The response includes details about the followers of the username `jackie`, such as their usernames, full names, and profile pictures, which were derived from the API response. This fulfills the user's instruction and demonstrates that the model effectively used the API data to generate the final answer."
17,My family and I are planning to move to a new city. We need help finding rental properties in the area. Can you give us the rent Zestimate and comparable properties? We would also like to see photos for these properties.,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2: The required API call is 'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2' with arguments '{""address"": ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404""}'. However, the model invoked the tool 'rent_zestimate_and_comparable_properties_for_zillow_v2' with arguments '{""address"":""San Francisco, CA""}', '{""address"":""San Francisco, CA"",""activateddays"":""30"",""activetypes"":""active"",""amenities"":""any"",""bedrooms"":""any"",""deactivateddays"":""30"",""distanceinmiles"":""5"",""laundry"":""any"",""pets"":""any"",""propertytypes"":""any""}', '{""address"":""Downtown San Francisco, CA"",""activateddays"":""30"",""activetypes"":""active"",""amenities"":""any"",""bedrooms"":""any"",""deactivateddays"":""30"",""distanceinmiles"":""5"",""laundry"":""any"",""pets"":""any"",""propertytypes"":""any""}', and '{""address"":""San Francisco, CA"",""activateddays"":""30"",""activetypes"":""active"",""amenities"":""any"",""bedrooms"":""any""}'. None of these tool calls match the required API call's arguments, specifically the address ""1545 Yale St, Santa Monica, CA 90404"". Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- For Objective 3: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, which is another reason for the failure of Objective 3."
18,"I'm looking for a rent property in a specific location. Can you help me find rental properties in the area, within 50 miles of the location?",5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model successfully invoked the required API call `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` with the correct arguments `{""location"":""Kenoza Lake, NY"",""search_within_x_miles"":50,""page"":1}`. The expected API call was `search_for_rent_for_realtor_search` with arguments `{""search_within_x_miles"": 50, ""location"": ""12750""}`. Although the location argument was initially provided as ""12750"", the model correctly interpreted it as ""Kenoza Lake, NY"" based on the response from the `auto_complete_for_realtor_search` tool, which is semantically correct and fulfills the requirement. The additional parameter `""page"":1` does not affect the correctness of the tool call.

For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer that correctly achieved the user's instruction. The final answer was based on the data retrieved from the API calls, specifically the rental property details found within 50 miles of Kenoza Lake, NY. The model provided specific details about the rental property, including the property type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, year built, and contact information, which indicates that the response was indeed derived from the API data. The final answer was given in the `Finish` tool call, confirming that the model successfully used the API calls to achieve the user's instruction."
19,"I'm interested in buying a property. Could you provide me with a list of available properties including their details like address, listing price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms?",3,Failure,Failure,"The model attempted to invoke a tool with the name ""invalid_hallucination_function_name"" instead of the required tool name ""realtorpropertylist_for_realtor_api_for_real_estate_data"". Although the arguments provided by the model (""city""","
Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it indicated that it was unable to retrieve any data and chose to ""give up and restart,"" which does not fulfill the user's requirement. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."
1,"As a frequent player of the Fantasy 5 game, I want to analyze the winning number sets. Please provide me with the number sets from December 1 to December 31?",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"": ""2023-12-01"", ""date2"": ""2023-12-31""}'. However, the model invoked 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with arguments '{""date1"":""12-01-2022"",""date2"":""12-31-2022""}'. The tool name is correct, but the arguments ""date1"" and ""date2"" are incorrect as they refer to the wrong year (2022 instead of 2023). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on incorrect data (from 2022 instead of 2023), which means the response does not fulfill the user's instruction correctly. Thus, Objective 3 is also a failure."
20,My company is expanding its business to a state North America. I need the time-zones in the region.,5,Success,Failure,"The required API call is `time_zone_for_geodb_cities` with the argument `{""zoneid""","1. `time_zones_for_geodb_cities` with arguments `{}` (twice).  
2. `admin_divisions_near_location_for_geodb_cities` with arguments `{""locationid"":""32.318231,-86.902298"",""radius"":""500"",""sort"":""population""}`.  
3. `countries_for_geodb_cities` with arguments `{}`.  
4. `city_details_for_geodb_cities` with arguments `{""cityid"":""5368361"",""languagecode"":""en""}`.  

None of these tool calls match the required API call. The required tool `time_zone_for_geodb_cities` with the specific argument `{""zoneid"": ""America__Los_Angeles""}` was not invoked. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

---

Objective 3: Failure  
Reason: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction, as there is no `return_type: give_answer` or `final_answer` in the provided data. The model attempted multiple tool calls but failed to retrieve the required information or provide a valid response based on the API data."
21,"I am planning a trip to a new country I have not been to before. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required API call `country_details_for_referential_db` with the correct argument `{""countrycode"":""DE""}`. The expected API call was `{""countryCode"": ""DE""}`, and the model's invocation matches the required tool name and argument (case-insensitive for the argument key, which is acceptable). Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer that includes the capital, region, and currency of Germany, as well as the list of states with their latitude and longitude. This information aligns with the data retrieved from the API calls (`country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db`). The response is based on the API data and fulfills the user's instruction, so Objective 3 is also a success.  

**Additional Notes**:  
- The model also invoked unnecessary tools (`countries_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db`), but this does not affect the evaluation of Objective 2 or Objective 3 since the required tool call was executed correctly.  
- The final answer is comprehensive and directly derived from the API responses, demonstrating effective use of the retrieved data."
22,"My friend is planning to travel to Middle East countries. Can you provide information about the country, including its currency and phone code? Additionally, we would like to know the list of cities in the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the following tools: 
  1. `countries_for_referential_db` with arguments `{}`
  2. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"":""GE""}`
  3. `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""GE""}`
  4. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""GE""}`

  The required API calls were:
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`
  2. `cities_in_a_country_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""QA""}`

  The model did not invoke the required API calls with the correct arguments. Specifically, the model used the country code `""GE""` (Georgia) instead of `""QA""` (Qatar). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is about Georgia, not Qatar, which does not fulfill the user's instruction. The model's response was not based on the required API calls, as it did not retrieve information about Qatar."
23,"I am planning a trip to a East Asia country. Can you provide me with the details of the country, including its capital, region, and currency? Additionally, I would like to know the list of states within the country and their respective latitude and longitude.",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required API calls with the correct arguments. The expected API calls are:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countryCode"": ""JP""}`  

  The actual tool calls made by the model are:  
  1. `country_details_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}`  
  2. `states_for_referential_db` with arguments `{""countrycode"": ""JP""}`  

  The tool names and arguments match the expected API calls, even though the argument key `countrycode` is in lowercase instead of `countryCode`. This is semantically correct and does not affect the functionality. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  

- **Objective 3**: The model's final response correctly achieves the user's instruction. It provides the capital, region, currency, and a list of prefectures in Japan with their respective latitude and longitude. The response is based on the data retrieved from the API calls (`country_details_for_referential_db` and `states_for_referential_db`). The final answer is structured and accurate, fulfilling the user's requirements. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
24,I'm looking for the photo of a property in CA. Can you provide me with the photo?,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the required API call 'get_photos_for_realtor_search' with the correct argument '{""property_id"": ""2215556385""}'. This matches the expected API call, so Objective 2 is a success.

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. The model attempted to retrieve property photos but failed due to the property ID not being available. It then tried to search for properties for sale again but did not conclude with a final answer based on the API data. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
25,I'm planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents and I want to find a restaurant. Can you suggest some intimate dining options? It would be helpful to see reviews and ratings for each restaurant.,8,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' with arguments '{""query"": ""restaurants, NY, USA""}'. The model invoked the tool 'search_places_for_local_businesses_by_outscraper' but with different arguments: '{""fields"":""name,rating"",""language"":""en"",""limit"":5,""query"":""intimate dining restaurant, New York"",""region"":""US""}'. The query parameter in the actual tool call does not match the required API call, as it specifies ""intimate dining restaurant, New York"" instead of ""restaurants, NY, USA"". Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

- For Objective 3, since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that directly fulfills the user's instruction based on the required API call. The model's responses were based on a different query and did not address the specific requirement of finding restaurants in NY, USA. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
26,"Please help me log in to my Pet Store account. Once logged in, I would like to check the details of a specific pet by using ID '1'. Lastly, I would like to log out of my account.",5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model successfully invoked all the required API calls with the correct arguments:  
1. **loginuser_for_pet_store** with arguments `{""username"": ""johnsmith"", ""password"": ""password123""}`. This matches the expected API call.  
2. **getpetbyid_for_pet_store** with arguments `{""petid"": 1}`. This matches the expected API call (note that ""petid"" and ""petId"" are semantically the same).  

The model also invoked an additional tool, **logoutuser_for_pet_store**, which was not required but does not affect the correctness of the required tool calls.  

For **Objective 3**, the model provided a final answer that correctly fulfilled the user's instruction. The response:  
""Successfully logged in as 'johnsmith', retrieved pet details for ID '1' (Name: doggie, Category: string, Status: available), and logged out of the account.""  
This answer is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, as evidenced by the tool responses. The response accurately reflects the pet details retrieved from **getpetbyid_for_pet_store** and confirms the login and logout actions.  

Thus, both objectives are successfully achieved."
27,I'm a fan of the show 'Squid Game' and I would like to know more about the show. Can you provide me with thE similar shows?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the required API call is 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{""id"": ""81040344""}'. However, the model invoked 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{""is_id"":""417121"",""limit"":""5""}'. The argument ""id"" is required to be ""81040344"", but the model used ""is_id"" with a different value ""417121"", which does not match the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on the incorrect tool call, which does not fulfill the user's instruction to find similar shows for the specified title ID ""81040344"". The model's response about ""Squid Game"" is irrelevant to the required API call and does not achieve the user's instruction."
28,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo 'nm1508003', from Movies 'Squid Game'",4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
For Objective 2, the model invoked the required API call 'title_get_charname_list_for_online_movie_database' with the correct arguments '{""tconst"": ""tt10919420"", ""is_id"": ""nm1508003""}'. Although the parameter name 'is_id' is used instead of 'id', the semantic meaning and the values are correct, which aligns with the expected API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is achieved successfully.

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer in the format that includes 'return_type': 'give_answer' and 'final_answer'. Although the model gathered the necessary information and attempted to conclude the task, the absence of a structured final answer means it failed to fully achieve the user's instruction as required. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
29,"I want to know all actors and actresses born on a specific day on July, Can you provide me with the list?",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""month"": ""7"", ""day"": ""27""}`. However, the model invoked the tool `actors_list_born_today_for_online_movie_database` with arguments `{""day"": 1, ""month"": 7}`. The arguments `day` and `month` do not match the required API call. Specifically, the `day` value is incorrect (1 instead of 27). Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure as well. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model does not fulfill the user's instruction, as it provides a list of actors born on July 1st instead of July 27th. The model's response is not based on the correct API data."
2,I am a music enthusiast and I want to know the top music charts. Could you provide me with the Hot 100 chart information?,5,Success,Success,"The model invoked the required API call 'hot_100_for_billboard' with the correct argument '{""date""","
Objective 3: Success
Reason: The model's final response correctly provided the Hot 100 chart information for July 20, 2022, which includes songs like ""As It Was"" by Harry Styles, ""About Damn Time"" by Lizzo, ""First Class"" by Jack Harlow, and ""Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)"" by Kate Bush. This information was indeed based on the data retrieved from the API call with the correct date. Therefore, Objective 3 is achieved."
30,"I am a movie enthusiast and would like to extract the Gong Yoo filmography-appearances, from Movies 'Squid Game', tt0092455",4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the model successfully invoked the required API call 'actors_get_filmography_appearances_for_online_movie_database' with the correct arguments '{""nconst"":""nm1508003"",""tconst"":""tt0092455""}'. This matches the expected API call exactly. The additional attempts with different IDs do not affect the correctness of the required tool call, as the model eventually used the correct parameters.

For Objective 3, the model's final response correctly addresses the user's instruction by acknowledging the inability to extract Gong Yoo's filmography appearances for the movie 'Squid Game' due to no valid results being returned. The final answer was based on the data retrieved from the API calls, specifically noting the lack of results, which aligns with the user's request to find information about Gong Yoo's appearances in 'Squid Game'. The model effectively used the API calls to conclude that no relevant data was available, fulfilling the user's instruction appropriately."
31,I run a financial blog and I want to write an article about the stock history of certain company. Can you provide me the earning price of this company?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `stock_index_trend_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with the argument `{""symbol"": ""TSLA""}`. However, the model invoked `stock_earnings_for_yahoo_finance_v2` with the argument `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`. The tool names do not match, which means the model did not execute the required API call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is about Tesla's earnings history, which is not aligned with the required API call that should have provided stock index trends. The model's response is not based on the required API data, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."
32,I am planning a family vacation to Europe and I need to convert our currency to Euros. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate from our currency to EUR?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `exchange_for_currency_v2` with the correct arguments `{""base"": ""USD"", ""to"": ""EUR""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly. Although the model also invoked an unnecessary tool `invalid_hallucination_function_name`, this does not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer stating, ""The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is approximately 0.97. Your currency will convert to about 0.97 Euros."" This answer is based on the data retrieved from the `exchange_for_currency_v2` API call, which returned the exchange rate of 0.97. The response correctly fulfills the user's instruction to provide the exchange rate from USD to EUR. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success."
33,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for a company? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `symbol_for_stock_data` with the argument `{""Symbol"": ""TSLA""}`. The model invoked the tool `symbol_for_stock_data` with the argument `{""symbol"":""TSLA""}`. Although the case of the argument key differs (`Symbol` vs. `symbol`), the semantic meaning and the value (`TSLA`) are correct. This is considered a success as the tool name and the required argument are accurately provided.  
- **Objective 3**: The model successfully retrieved the stock details for Tesla (TSLA) using the API response and provided a final answer summarizing key information such as P/E Ratio, EPS (ttm), Market Cap, Sales, and Gross Margin. The response is based on the data retrieved from the API call, fulfilling the user's instruction. The final answer is complete and accurate, demonstrating effective use of the API data."
34,I am a cryptocurrency trader and I want to analyze the price and volume metrics for the futures markets. Can you provide me with the data?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2, the model invoked the tool 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with the arguments '{""base"":""USDT"",""start"":""2023-05-05T10:05:00"",""symbol"":""BTC"",""market_venue"":""BINANCE""}'. This matches the required API call 'ohlcv_vwap_futures_for_cryptocurrency_financial_data' with arguments '{""symbol"": ""BTC"", ""market_venue"": ""BINANCE"", ""start"": ""2023-05-05T10:05:00"", ""base"": ""USDT""}'. The tool name and all required arguments are correct, and additional parameters are not present, so it is a success for Objective 2.
- For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer that correctly summarized the price and volume metrics for BTC futures on BINANCE for the specified date. The final answer was based on the data retrieved from the API call, as evidenced by the response content and the subsequent summary provided by the model. The user's instruction was effectively achieved using the API data, so it is a success for Objective 3."

For Objective 2, the required API call is 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with arguments '{""from"": ""JPY"", ""to"": ""EUR"", ""amount"": 1000}'. However, the model invoked 'convert_for_currency_conversion_and_exchange_rates' with arguments '{""amount"":""1000"",""is_from"":""USD"",""to"":""EUR""}'. The arguments do not match the required API call, specifically the ""from"" currency is ""JPY"" in the required call but ""USD"" in the actual call. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the final answer provided by the model is based on converting USD to EUR, which does not fulfill the user's instruction to convert JPY to EUR. Hence, the final answer does not achieve the user's instruction, further confirming the failure of Objective 3."

The model did not invoke the required API call with the correct arguments, specifically the ""base"" and ""symbols"" parameters are incorrect. Therefore, Objective 2 is a failure.

- Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction based on the required API call. The final answer provided by the model is based on incorrect API calls, which do not match the required API call. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure."
48,I need to know the scores of the football matches played on a specific date. Can you fetch me the scores?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model invoked the required tool `get_scores_for_given_date_for_football_score_api` with the correct argument `{""date"":""2024-01-15""}`. This matches the expected API call exactly, so Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model attempted to retrieve football match scores but received empty responses from both the specified date and today's live scores. Instead of providing a final answer based on the API responses, the model chose to give up and restart, which does not fulfill the user's instruction to provide football match scores. Therefore, Objective 3 is a failure.  

Note: Since the model did not provide a valid final answer based on the API responses, it fails to achieve the user's instruction. Additionally, while the model invoked additional unnecessary tools (e.g., `get_football_live_scores_today_for_football_score_api`), this does not affect the evaluation of Objective 2, as the required tool call was correctly executed."

4,I want to start my day with some quotes. Could you give me some quotes of my interested topic?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `success_quote_for_olato_quotes` with no arguments (`{}`). The model invoked this exact tool call with the correct name and arguments. Additionally, the model invoked two other tools (`motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes` and `love_quote_for_olato_quotes`), which are not required but do not affect the correctness of the required tool call. Since the model invoked all required tool calls with the correct arguments, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model provided a final answer that includes the required success quote: ""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm. -Winston Churchill."" The response is based on the data retrieved from the API calls, and it fulfills the user's instruction to provide a motivational, success, and love quote. Therefore, Objective 3 is a success.  

**Details**:  
- **Tool invoked by the model**:  
  1. `motivation_quote_for_olato_quotes` with arguments `{}`  
  2. `success_quote_for_olato_quotes` with arguments `{}`

This matches the expected API call `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with arguments `{""sdate"": ""2020-01-01"", ""edate"": ""2020-12-31"", ""ticker"": ""TSLA""}`. The additional tool calls made by the model, such as `stock_price_for_yh_finance_complete` and another `yh_historical_for_yh_finance_complete` with different dates, do not affect the correctness of the required tool call.  

For Objective 3, the model did not provide a final answer to the user's instruction. Instead, it encountered errors during the API calls and ultimately decided to ""give up and restart."" Since the model failed to retrieve the required data and did not fulfill the user's instruction, Objective 3 is a failure. Additionally, since Objective 2 is a success, this failure is independent of Objective 2."
5,I need to conduct a research study for my final year project. Can you give me a list of casual questions in US asked on search engines related to the subjects I'm investigating?,4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
- **Objective 2**: The model successfully invoked the required tool `getmultiplequestions_for_asktheworld` with the correct arguments `{""countrycode"": ""US"", ""keyword"": ""technology"", ""multiplequestions"": true}`. Although the required API call specifies `""countryCode"": ""us""` (lowercase), the model used `""countrycode"": ""US""` (uppercase), which is semantically equivalent and does not affect the correctness. The additional parameter `""multiplequestions"": true` is also acceptable as per the guidelines. Therefore, Objective 2 is a success.  
- **Objective 3**: The model failed to provide a valid final answer based on the API responses. The API calls returned errors, and the model ultimately gave up, stating, ""I am unable to retrieve casual questions related to technology due to issues with the API. Therefore, I give up on this attempt."" This response does not fulfill the user's instruction, as no casual questions related to technology were provided. Hence, Objective 3 is a failure."
6,I am a university fresh graduate and I am looking for nodejs developer as my first job. Can you help me to look for the salary of a nodejs developer?,7,Success,Success,Failure,"
Reason:  
**Objective 2**: The required API call is `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with arguments `{""job_title"": ""nodejs developer"", ""location"": ""New York""}`. The model successfully invoked this tool with the correct name and arguments: `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with `{""job_title"":""nodejs developer"",""location"":""New York""}`. The additional tool calls made by the model (e.g., `search_for_jsearch`) do not affect the success of Objective 2, as they are not required.  

**Objective 3**: The final response provided by the model does not fulfill the user's instruction. The model encountered an error while searching for jobs in New York and ultimately chose to ""give up and restart."" This indicates that the model did not successfully achieve the user's instruction based on the API data. Additionally, the final response does not provide a conclusive answer or utilize the API data effectively, leading to a failure for Objective 3. Since Objective 2 was successful, this failure is independent of Objective 2."
7,I am a university fresh graduate and looking for jobs in New York. Can you help me to look for the job salary in new york?,6,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason:  
For **Objective 2**, the model invoked the required tool `estimated_salary_for_jsearch` with the correct arguments: `{""job_title"":""Node.JS Developer"",""location"":""New York""}`. Although the job title in the model's call (`Node.JS Developer`) is slightly different from the required call (`nodejs developer`), the semantic meaning is very close, and the location is correct. Therefore, this is considered a success for Objective 2.  

For **Objective 3**, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction. The user's instruction was likely to retrieve salary information for a Node.JS developer in New York, but the model repeatedly failed to find salary data and instead provided job listing details. Since the final answer was not based on the API response and did not achieve the user's instruction, this is considered a failure for Objective 3. Additionally, the absence of a `give_answer` return type further confirms the failure."
8,I'm a content creator and I want to analyze the engagement on my TikTok videos. Please provide me with the profile information of my TikTok account.,5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- **Objective 2**: The required API call is `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with the argument `{""username"": ""the_beautyofcinema""}`. The actual tool calls invoked by the model include `profile_for_tiktok_v3` with the argument `{""username"": ""your_username""}`. The argument `""username""` does not match the required argument `""the_beautyofcinema""`. Therefore, the model did not execute the required API call with the expected argument, leading to a failure for Objective 2.
  
- **Objective 3**: Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also a failure. Additionally, the model did not provide a final answer that fulfills the user's instruction based on the data retrieved from the API calls. The model attempted to gather engagement metrics and related data but was unsuccessful, and it did not provide a final answer based on the API responses. Therefore, Objective 3 is also a failure."

- For Objective 2, the model successfully invoked the required API call `video_details_for_tiktok_api` with the correct argument `{""video_id"": ""7097255034731138310""}`. Although the model initially made incorrect attempts without the required `video_id`, it eventually corrected itself and made the correct API call. This meets the criteria for Objective 2.
  
- For Objective 3, the model provided a final answer that correctly fulfilled the user's instruction. The final answer included the description, author, and creation time of the video, which were all derived from the data retrieved via the API call. This shows that the model effectively used the API data to achieve the user's instruction, meeting the criteria for Objective 3."
