10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool calls and the actual tool calls invoked by the model do not match completely. 
Required API calls:
1. youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search with arguments '{""channelname"": ""mrbeast""}'
2. channel_details_for_youtube_search with arguments '{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}'

Actual tool calls made by the model:
1. youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search with '{""channelname"": ""mr.besst""}'
2. youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search with '{""channelname"": ""PewDiePie""}'
3. youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search with '{""channelname"": ""MrBeast""}' (This argument correctly incidental aligns with the casing different with expected, which is acceptable.)
4. channel_details_for_youtube_search with '{""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}' (Correct)

Despite achieving a partial output match, the first actual call for YouTube channel searching by channel name has incorrect channel_name input (""mr.besst"" vs the expected ""mrbeast""). Also, the expected ""mrbeast"" argument appears in lower case compared to argued ""MrBeast.""

Since Objective 2 fails due to a mismatch of one call between requested and executed tasks, Objective 3 automatically results in a failure."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call had the function 'validate_email_for_validate_email' with argument '{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}'. The actual API call made by the model used the function 'validate_email_for_validate_email' with argument '{""email"": ""testing.com""}'. 
Since the email arguments (""test@gmail.com"" vs. ""testing.com"") were different, Objective 2 fails. Hence, Objective 3 fails correspondingly as the initial call required to consider it was based on incorrect requirements regardless of whether overtime the model provided a response related to email validation process or not. Additionally, mostly facilitating 'give_up_and_restart' and advising about a bad email shows improper handling of a user need when QR fails."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool or API call is 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator' with arguments `'{ ""date"": ""19870630"" }'`. While the hydrants cited in the transcript show instances invoking 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator' with both an invalid date `'{ ""date"": ""99999999"" }'` as an incorrect tool call (implicated since required arguments are erroneously specified) as well as for the initially anticipated/correct date `'{ ""date"":""19870630"" }'`, invoking extra nonessential and invalid calls signifies departure from fulfilling the critically complete scenario of reliably executing requisite actions leading to parsimony where duties meet absolute essential UX requirements or business flow.

13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls identified were 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with specific arguments {""relatedtovideoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""id,snippet"", ""type"": ""video""}; 'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments {""id"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""contentDetails,snippet,statistics""}; and 'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments {""videoid"": ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", ""part"": ""snippet"", ""maxresults"": ""100""}. The actual tool called by the model was 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with different arguments {""maxresults"":5,""part"":""snippet"",""relatedtovideoid"":""5xxjJJKQ4y8"",""type"":""video""}. This indicates that the necessary ""relatedtovideoID"", “part”, and ""maxresults"" values did not match the required, hence failing Objective 2.
Objective 3 depends on Detection from Objective 2; since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is similarly judged as a failure. Additionally, no final response relevant to the initial task was provided by the model."
14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The two required API calls are as mentioned:
1. {'name': 'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2', 'arguments': '{""playlistid"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'}
2. {'name': 'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2', 'arguments': '{""is_id"": ""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"", ""part"": ""snippet""}'}

From the logs:
1. There were calls made for fetching the playlist videos from 'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with the same parameter arguments as required (specified playlistid and part).
2. There was a call made for fetching playlist details through 'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with corresponding arguments to the required ones (noting the identity confirmations for the data).

Thus, all expected tools stipulated have been covered authentically and respectively fulfilling the correct wall in terms of invocation and arguments.

For Objective 3:
The Objective 2 matched as required, however, there is no documented final response to confirm if those data obtained via the API were accurately utilized for addressing user questions. The logs do not reveal a defined final response analysis section; another round of playlists' existing operations annotated seems decided from API data but the continuing procedure posed responsively doesn't appear conclusive labeling unclear proof that tailored directions streamlined were used for deriving enduses; again because the end outcome output quotient hasn't clearly bobbed up mentioned any sourced or corroborated conclusion hereto. Hence assuming the corroborations isn't provide a resolved use-case response adherign exactly to enlisted measures turning over a failure in deposit error retrieval assurances considered bassline directional facades veilen't defined-resoulustructure fore invoected parametroff repoplan ctusage sequences."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model were 'user_s_followers_for_twitter' with arguments '{""user_id"":""987654321""}' and 'Finish'. The expected tool calls were 'user_s_followers_for_twitter' with arguments '{
  ""user_id"": ""96479162""
 }' and 'user_s_likes_for_twitter' with arguments '{
  ""user_id"": ""96479162""
 }'. The tool call for 'user_s_followers_for_twitter' had not only an incorrect user ID (96479162 required, but 987654321 was used) but there was also a missing required call for 'user_s_likes_for_twitter' for the user with ID '96479162'. Therefore, key arguments do not align nor are all expected calls made.

Since Objective 2 failed because not all required API calls were made, the task set for Objective 3 must not have been satisfied based on fully correct API usage. This directly infers Objective 3 too fails."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call expected was 'user_details_for_twitter' with arguments consisting of a single string parameter ""{\n  \""username\"": \""omarmhaimdat\""\n }"". However, the API calls made by the model were 'search_for_twitter' with varying arguments about retweet counts and queries but not the specific 'user_details_for_twitter' API call. Without the expected API call being accurately invoked by the model, Objective 2 fails, which in consequence directly causes the failure of Objective 3 as the response could not be based on data retrieved from the correct API call. Furthermore, the model's interaction indicates no final resolution, solidifying the assessment to a failure in both objectives."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",5,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API call is to invoke 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3' with the argument { ""search"": ""google.com""}. This matches with one of the tools invoked by the model: 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3' with the argument { ""search"": ""google.com""} at the end of the sequence. This confirms that the necessary tool was used, thereby meeting the requirement for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, although there was indeed results fetched corresponding to the request ""google.com"" and the results were displayed to the guest; in the final output, the assistant added unnecessary elaboration by comparing 'google.com' to 'wikimedia.org', which wasn't part of the original user request evident from theirs provide scenario. Moreover, the last spoken line listed focuses on checking similarity that the user hasn't asked for, thus, the assistant's response deviates and fails to stick only to user’s implied retrieval and presentation guidelines. Here, raw retrieved data is correctly used but computational actions taken upon the data veer off the user's direct intentions, conclusively determining the drift where unnecessary checking and comparison communications are done, not there in the input task in any evaluator provided inputs-parameter-framework. Hence, trope failure registered for biased or not factual revocation-resistant final response in the managerial terminological annotation opaque portion results opaquely."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API tool expects a call to 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with a date of ""2024-06-01"", but the model invoked the tool with dates ""2025-06-01"", “2025-06-15”, ""2022-06-01"", and “2022-06-15”. Since none of these dates match the expected date from the tool requirements, Objective 2 fails. Consequently, Objective 3 is also a failure because it directly depends on the successful completion of Objective 2."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call is 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with argument '{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'. The actual API calls made by the model invoked 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with a different set of arguments: '{""date"":""2025-02-30""}' and '{""date"":""2025-02-31""}'. The dates requested by the model differ from the expected date ""2024-02-18,"" which means required arguments were not correctly supplied by the model, leading to a failure in fulfilling Objective 2. Furthermore, due to Objective 2’s failure, Objective 3 is inherently a failure as well."
1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls in the provided data invoke the correct tool names ('packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' and 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2') but with incorrect arguments. In both tool invocations where argument 'trackingnumber': 'YT9999999999' is present instead of the expected 'trackingNumber': 'YT2003521266065328'. Thus, because the actual tool calls did not use the expected arguments, Objective 2 is a failure.

Considering the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 also automatically fails. Furthermore, there was no final concretized answer given for how to progress besides either restarting or expressing a failure to retrieve tracking information, indicating that the API data wasn't effectively useful to conclude or fulfill user's request."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call expected was 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with the specific argument date of ""2024-02-18"". However, the actual tool calls invoked by the model are 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with `""date"": ""2025-02-28""`, `""date"": ""2024-02-29""` and two retries for `""2025-02-28""`. None of these tool calls match the exact date of ""2024-02-18"" required by the user, hence Objectives 1 fails. Given that Objective 2 fails, it directly implicates a failure in Objective 3."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model was 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{""date"":""2025-02-28""}'. However, the expected required tool call was 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with arguments '{""date"":""2024-02-18""}'. The difference in the provided date values '2025-02-28' versus the expected '2024-02-18' resulted in a failure to match the expected tool call for Objective 2. Due to this incorrect tool invocation which compromises Objective 2, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure. Moreover, the output showing that the index could not be accessed reinforces the inability to fulfill the user's instruction based on the required data."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls were 
1. 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""80057281""}' 
2. 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{""ids"": ""80057281""}'. 

However, the actual tool invoked by the model was:
1. 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{""is_id"": ""90068472""}'.
 
The 'ids' value of the invoked API call (""90068472"") does not match with the required 'is_id' value, which should be ""80057281"". Moreover, the second expected tool 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with arguments relating to the ""80057281"" ID was not invoked at all.

Thus, since the required API calls were not invoked accurately as needed, Objective 2 is a failure leading directly to a failure for Objective 3."
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472. Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool call by the model was 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{""is_id"":""90068472"",""limit"":""25""}'. The required API calls were for 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with ""{\n  \""is_id\"": \""80057281\""\n }"" and 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with '{\n  ""ids"": ""80057281""\n }'. 
The model call addressed the 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' but used a completely different 'is_id' (90068472 instead of 80057281). Moreover, it did not call 'title_details_for_netflix_data' as required.

The evaluation on Objective 3 is also a Failure since Objective 2 was found to be a failure, invalidating accuracy or correct functionality regarding implementing user instruction based on required data from API calls. Moreover, the model stated it gives up and restarts, indicating a failure to fulfill the user request using the tool's data."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls required arguments with the website ""getecz.com"" for the tools 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' and 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro'. However, the actual tools invoked included these tools but with ""ourbusinessplatform123124.net"" in the arguments, not ""getecz.com"". This deviation constitutes a failed match of arguments in Objective 2. Without achieving Objective 2, we immediately consider Objective 3 as a failure as well."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",4,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the required API calls included:
1. 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with '{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }'.
2. 'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with '{ ""website"": ""getecz.com"" }'.

The actual tool calls made by the model that correspond to the required calls are:
1. 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with arguments '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'.
2. 'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with arguments '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'.

These perfectly match the required tool calls in terms of both the tool name and arguments, verifying the success of Objective 2. Apparently, additional unrelated tool calls exist, referring to the monitoring operations of a different website ('ourbusinessplatform1234567.net'), but these additional calls do not impact Objective 2's success. 

Objective 3 is assessed a failure since there were issues reported with the retrieved data during the webpage audits (warnings related to retrieval of meta tags), and the answers provided when describing the spectacles of the analyzed warnings critiqued violations of API data usage. These error statements from API results directly affected the comprehensible reporting in the response without deriving from resourceful lead results by suggesting alternative analyses on existing flaws elucidated in handling failures such as threat pointers for name solving. Key functional data like site title, meta descriptions, or active meta keywords was either missing or null; the Assistant recognized such deficiencies and shared a strained entrenuity to achieve chiastic consistency viably.

26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call specified is 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with '{\n  ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"",\n  ""variable"": ""x""\n }' argument. Comparing this with the actual tool calls made by the model, the function 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' was correctly invoked with arguments for expression ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"" and variable ""x"", achieving Objective 2. Further, the final answer provided by the model - ""The derivative of the expression '2*x^2 + 3*x + 1' with respect to 'x' is '4*x + 3' - was based on the data retrieved from this function call, successfully fulfilling the user’s request in the final format, thereby meeting Objective 3 as well."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The mandatory APIs from the requirements were 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile' with arguments '{""username"":""leomessi""}' (successfully called by the model) and 'get_story_for_instagram_profile' with the same arguments (not invoked by the model). Therefore, as not all expected tool calls were made (the 'get_story_for_instagram_profile' function was missing), Objective 2 is marked as a failure. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 also automatically fails."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",7,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: For Objective 2, the actual tool call issued was 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary' with the argument '{""term"":""onomatopoeiaa""}', while the required API call specified the function name 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary' with the argument '{ ""term"": ""onomatopoeia"" }'. Since the term ""onomatopoeiaa"" contains a spelling mistake as compared to the required ""onomatopoeia"", it fails the execution against the expected requirement leading to Objective 3 failure as the foundation (Objective 2) itself was incorrect. Furthermore, since the answer and search endeavor that was given in the final response revolved around an inaccurately requested term, instead of using the results from the accurate required tool invocation, Objective 3 inherently cannot fulfill the goal of effectively basing the result upon retrieved API data concerning ""onomatopoeia""."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,2,Failure,Success,Success,"Reason:
- For Objective 2, the actual tool calls by the model are:
  'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data' with arguments '{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}'.
  The required API calls coincide exactly in terms of tool name and parameters:
  'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data' with '{ ""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR"" }'.
  All parameters match exactly between the model call and the required specification.

- For Objective 3, an answer to the user's instructions is available, stated as:
  ""The current exchange rate from JPY to EUR is 0.0062. To convert 1000 JPY to EUR, you would get 6.20 EUR.""
  This answer, found within the model's API-powered ""give_answer"", correctly utilizes the retrieved data showing handling from the correct currency exchange rates based on the successful API calls and correctly computed amount from previous call results. Thus, achieving the user's instruction by leveraging the outputs of the invoked tools."
2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API calls specified were:
1. 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }'
2. 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' with arguments '{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328"" }'

From the tool calls made by the model, the following invocations matching the expected tools are observed:
1. 'packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2' invoked correctly with arguments '{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'
2. 'carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2' invoked correctly with arguments '{""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}'

These callings precisely match the expected requirements meeting Objective 2 as successful.

The final answer given by the model was ""The package with tracking number YT2003521266065328 is being handled by carrier Yun Express. It is currently in transit, and detailed event information is not available yet."" This response uses exact information from the successful API call to track packages and determine carriers (reliable data sources as evidenced in the transcripts). Hence, Objective 3 is also meeting the success criterion."
30,"I need a list of trending pages on 9GAG along with their posts. Also, fetch the comments for a specific post and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'.",5,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call is 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with the argument ""{ 'username': 'kleido007' }"". but the actual tool call made by the model was 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with the argument '{ ""username"": ""hugo1232fesfgerwt"" }'. Therefore, the argument ""username"" does not match the actual expected username 'kleido007'. According to the specified rule if there's no match for the arguments, Objective 2 fails, hence leading directly to a failure in Objective 3 as well. Additionally, though a final response was generated and returned a comment about another function like lacking user details and where posts from trending pages on 9GAG were found doesn't stand assured due to the already noted failures in Objective 2 that impacted Objective 3."
31,"Retrieve the posts from a specific category on 9GAG and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'. Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",6,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected required API call was:
- 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed', with arguments '{ ""username"": ""kleido007"" }'
However, the actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. 'get_categories_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with empty '{}'
2. 'get_posts_from_category_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with arguments '{""category"":""cats""}'

The username provided (""hugo1232fesfgerwt"") alongside other related tool calls does not match the expected username ""kleido007"", leading to a failure for Objective 2. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 is also treated as a failure since the model could not potentially achieve the specified instruction of getting detailed user information based on the exact expected username data needed."
32,"I'm a music lover and want to discover TikTok videos featuring a specific song. Can you fetch the music information for the song with the ID '8394725634879021564'?

33,"I need to analyze the engagement of a TikTok user's followers. Can you retrieve the follower list for a user with the ID '64556346745'? Also, fetch the user information for these followers.",7,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call is 'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video' with the arguments including 'user_id', 'count', and 'time'. However, the model uses calls primarily to 'user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video' and 'search_user_for_tiktok_download_video'. None of the API calls - approaches the expected action or purpose and the required argument fields do not harmonize. Additionally, 'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video' specifically is not related nor found in the actual tools invoked. Since Objective 2 is a failure, Objective 3 must be deemed a failure as well with significant concerns against relying on searched or retrieved data from successors to meet the user's prompt. There is no final \""""give_answer\"""" key present either, suggesting insufficient flow towards a intended solution based on responses."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls required the tools 'get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api', 'get_stream_views_for_twitch_api', and 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' each with the argument 'channel' set to ""xqc"". However, the tool calls issued by the model referred to the same API functions but with 'channel' set to ""dfasagergs"", thus not meeting the requirements as per the specifications of Objective 2. Due to mismatches in the crucial argument values (""xqc"" vs ""dfasagergs""), Objective 2 is a failure. As the prerequisite of Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 automatically results in a failure as well."
35,Find the streamer 'shadoune66666' streamer's info.,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls required `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` with an argument of `{""channel"": ""shadoune666""}`. However, the actual API calls made by the model posing an exact match for `get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api` contained an incorrect `channel` argument `{""channel"":""36533048""}` which was retrieved from another invocation of `get_user_id_for_twitch_api` using the input `""channel"":""shadoune666""`. Since an exact channel argument match (or acceptance of proper transcription from username to userID) is critical and failing this directly impacts subsequent processes, the tool-invocations fails Objective 2. With the failure of Objective 2, by default, the processing cascade to significantly impact the effectiveness and integrity of the results needed for Objective 3, marking it a Failure due to reliance on incorrect DOI/API-extraction patterns-toast furtherance entail reasonably corrective assembly from gathered data or competence in end deployment construction."
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call required was 'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls' with the argument having UPC value of ""194574942221"". While the model did issue this call, there was also an unfulfilled requirement for an initial UPC of ""286193748563"". This missing necessary call fails the first objective. Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also automatically fails. Therefore, the model did not fulfill the requirement fully as per expected calls."
37,"I'm redecorating my home and looking for furniture options. Can you list the available furniture products on Kohls? Also, provide me with the product reviews for a specific product with webID 5372023.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: There is a missing expected tool call and incorrect arguments provided. The expected API call required `{'name': 'reviews_list_for_kohls', 'arguments': '{ ""productid"": ""4201989"" }'}`, but the actual tool call made was `{ 'function': {'arguments': '{""productid"":""5372023""}', 'name': 'reviews_list_for_kohls'}, 'type': 'function'}`. The argument indicated a different product ID (`5372023` instead of `4201989`). Correctrequires both correct function and argument match, and since the expected call with the specific arguments for ""productid: 4201989"" wasn't used, we consider it a failure for Objective 2. Due to Objective 2 failure, Objective 3 is automatically inferred as a failure as well."
38,"I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this product, including images, pricing, and customer reviews?",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model included 'products_list_for_wayfair', 'products_search_for_wayfair', and 'reviews_list_for_wayfair'. However, the expected API calls required were calls to 'products_detail_for_wayfair' with SKU ""W003247135"" and 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' with SKU ""W003247135"". The actual tool invoked for 'products_detail_for_wayfair' was not identified as no such function name was used. The only correct match was 'reviews_list_for_wayfair'. Since not all expected tool calls were made correctly, Objective 2 is a failure, which directly leads to a failure in Objective 3. Additionally, the response does not indicate the tool 'products_detail_for_wayfair' was ever used, which also would invalidate the final answer depending on this missing data."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
- The expected tool calls are: 
1) 'products_detail_for_wayfair' with arguments '{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'
2) 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' with arguments '{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'

- Reviewing the actual models' tool calls:
1) ""products_list_for_wayfair"" with argument '{""categoryid"":214970}'
2) ""reviews_list_for_wayfair"" with several different SKU numbers none of which is ""W003247135"".
3) ""products_search_for_wayfair"" with keyword searchString.

None of the actual tool function 'products_detail_for_wayfair' was called for the SKU ""W003247135."" Also, the something similar (search function for specific SKU ""W003247135"") itself is missing. 

Additionally, none of the correct reviews of the exact ""W003247135"" product were provided according to the required API calls expectation except two separate instances of 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' for a distinct SKU reference. 

Since Objective 2 did not succeed, Objective 3 fails automatically, represented by remarks such as the assistant indicating the lack of reviews and products details, implying the calls used for data were not helpful in fulfilling the users’ instruction."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,5,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model were:
1. 'get_similar_apps_for_ios_store' with arguments '{""is_id"":""1053012308""}'
2. 'get_ios_app_for_ios_store' with arguments '{""is_id"":""1053012308""}'

The required API calls were:
1. 'get_similar_apps_for_iOS_Store' with arguments '{""is_id"":""1053012308""}'
2. 'get_iOS_app_for_iOS_Store' with arguments '{""is_id"":""1053012308""}'

The spelling variances in 'for_ios_store' vs 'for_iOS_Store' could be technical alias differences. Thus we have exact matches for both the tool names and the required arguments aligning them adequately for a success in Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the final output from the assistant was based directly on the data received from calls regarding getting information about Clash Royale and the similar app, Castle Crush: Clash Cards Game, clearly utilizing the tool calls outputs about these apps and their details appropriately in the response to the user's instruction."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls required:

1. For 'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`
2. For 'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with arguments `{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}`

The actual tool calls made by the model were:

1. For 'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with arguments `{""productid"":""3OM3PS""}`
2. For 'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' with arguments `{""productid"":""3OM3PS""}`
3. An unnecessary tool call 'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'

While the name of the tools invoked are correct, there are discrepancies in both the productId argument format (""productId"" vs. ""productid"") and actual values (""B00K3OM3PS"" vs. ""3OM3PS""). Besides these, the 'finish' tool invoked by the model is also unnecessary as per user requirements and the provided answer which mandates using specific review and offers retrieval tools with precise arguments nesting and values. 

As Objective 2 results in a failure due to incorrect argument names and values in API calls made by the model aligning with the expected arguments, Objective 3 is straightaway a failure as well. No substantial answer or interaction based on retrieved product information was provided due to the initial API call failures and also because there is no final response matching user requirement confirmed in the logs."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls specified by the user required specific product details with the exact productId ""B00K3OM3PS"" for Amazon Data Scraper APIs, namely 'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2', 'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2', 'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'. However, the model was found calling similar functions but using the productId ""3OM3PS"" instead, which doesn’t match the required argument ""B00K3OM3PS"".

All parameter intricacies respect the productId specification (""B00K3OM3PS"" vs ""3OM3PS"") and due to semantically different product queries(accompanied with spelling casts), this confirms a failed climax against the backdrop of expected instructions. As a result of the semantic and spell breaches in argument handling, Objective 2 has failed.

Considering the breakdown achieved in Objective 2, where the APIs didn't even support sought functionalities duly signaling irreputable criteria underpin for all performance match indices, directly cascades in totality leading to the Objective 3 failure."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,4,Failure,Success,Success,"
Reason: The tool calls invoked include 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' which was correctly executed two times using the two different arguments: ""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7"" at the first time, using the tool's required API call actively using ""{\""is_id\"":\""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7\""}"", which matches the required API call.
Furthermore, the request first identified a problem with time out. then due to ongoing provision to get all race details succeeded with including the needed ID-related info based in another API tool call aligns with the user require guide contacting planning semantically connecting the identification details to needed appropriate grand-prix.

43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specifies the function 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with the arguments '{""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}'. However, the actual tools invoked by the model used '""is_id"":""d27e0de553b9d7""', which differs from the expected as additional preceding characters '6141c7661' are absent in the actual tool invocation. As Objective 2 has failed, Objective 3 is directly considered a failure as well. The model lacks completion in making the necessary API calls as prescribed, therefore none of the subsequent actions or outputs derives correctly from the required API data request flow."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model was required to make the API call 'symbol_for_stock_data' with arguments containing the symbol ""TQQQ"". However, the actual tool calls made by the model invoked 'symbol_for_stock_data' with arguments containing the symbol ""QQQQ"". Since the essential argument (""Symbol"") does not match between the expected and actual API calls (as required for objective 1), the outcome is considered a failure. Consequently, objective 2 also fails on account of objective 1's failure, which precludes effective data retrieval and response creation that hinges on such a retrieval."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the required tool ""get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats"" with the argument correctly (despite capitalization, still satisfying the requirement with name as ""Riven""). Though this Requirement is Missing 'get_list_of_all_champion_names_for_league_of_legends_stats', required tool invocation is successfully performed for analyzing 'Riven' which is principally necessary.  However, Objective 3 is not met because although the final answer mentioned the success acknowledged ""Base stats for champion 'Riven'"", there is a missing relation to originating from the tool call or adequately providing completed final answer as output. This may be due to lack of final outputs following the perceived confirmation seen within the 'Finish' functionality - leading to a perceived inconsistent refund of compiled detail back to user senses."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,4,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API tool call `""product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data""` should have an arguments structure that includes `""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V""`. However, in the actual tool call invoked by the model, the arguments instead include `""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V1""` (with an extra ""1"" at the end of the ASIN). This mismatch in the ASIN argument directly leads to a failure in addressing the expected tool call, hence fulfilling Objective 2 is not achieved. Since Objective 2 is a failure, it necessitates Objective 3 as a failure as well. We thus avoid dissecting Objective 3 further in detail due to the predetermined failure from Objective 2."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call to be invoked by the model was 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' with the arguments '{ ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"", ""toLang"": ""fr"" }'. Although the argument label ""tolang"" and JSON syntax format different (""toLang"":""fr""), the second invocation by the model used the function 'translate_for_translate_all_languages' with arguments {""text"":""Hello, how are you?"", ""tolang"":""fr""}' addressing this requirement effectively. Furthermore, the final provided translation, ""Bonjour comment allez-vous?"" appropriately utilized the correct API result, ensuring Objective 3's success which is directly retrieved from the response given in translate tool (confirmed dependency from API tool response, having calculated the result from ""translatedText"": ""'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'""). Therefore objectives 1 and 2 are most accurately defined as successful completions."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,4,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call was for 'get_info_day_for_working_days' with arguments '{""country_code"":""US"",""date"": ""2022-12-31""}'. The corresponding API tool invoked by the model name 'get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days' should be accounted as the corresponding API tool since the truncation matches, and similarly ""get_…_get_info_day_for_working_days"" very closely represents a direct modification due to displaying identification patterns. The actual arguments used were '{""country_code"": ""US"", ""date"": ""2022-12-31""}'. The data used matches directly, confirming Objective 2 Success despite usage of name variants attributed to identification. 
For Objective 3: The answer given by the assistant, stating that ""'2022-12-31' is not a working day in the US as it is a weekend (Saturday). There are no working hours on this day,"" directly corresponds to the user's queries and is built upon tool calls' data proving it as accura...""Finalizing"" label does correspond to the continuity that emerges from confirming 2022-12-31′s day-status structure. Thus, this stipulates data-related decision-making incorporated with social contracts towards a successful comprehension depth on announced calendar perceptions."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call that needed to be invoked by the model was 'analyse_for_working_days' with the arguments '{\n  ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",\n  ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"",\n  ""country_code"": ""US""\n }'. Although there is evidence of this type of analysis, the actual tool calls made by the enhanced model were via the truncated 'get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days' function. This discrepancy in the tool's name results in misalignment with the expected single universally formatted API call ('analyse_for_working_days'). Since Objective 2 is a failure, automatically, Objective 3 is considered a failure, prohibiting evaluation of the effectiveness in achieving the user's instruction using the API responses."
4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model invoked the tool named 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5' with the arguments '{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}' which match exactly what was required (name: 'drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5', with arguments: '{""date1"":""01-01-2023"",""date2"":""01-10-2023""}').
For Objective 3, the final answer reflects the information retrieved from the database regarding Fantasy 5 winning numbers between the correctly formatted date range, as the assistant supplied the winning numbers of Fantasy 5 (seen in the assistant's prompt)."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call required is 'add_working_hours_for_working_days' with arguments having ""start_time"": ""08:15"", while the model invoked tools 'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days' with arguments having ""start_time"": ""25:15"" and ""start_time"": ""01:15"". This visible discrepancy in the ""start_time"" values leads to a failure to match the arguments as specified. Given Objective 2 resulted in failure, according to evaluation rules, Objective 3 is automatically considered a failure."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor' with the argument '{ ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae"" }'. None of the actual API calls made by the model match this specific argument for 'monitorAddressId'. The model made multiple calls to 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor', but none of these included the required argument, causing the model to fail Objective 2, leading to a failure also in Objective 3."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",5,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The two required API tool calls were 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with the argument `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}` and 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with the argument `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}`. The actual tool calls made by the model were 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with various arguments including `{""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""}`, which failed twice (incorrect values noted by IP addressing errors as evident from the error response), and the correct IP call made with `{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}` only slightly matched one of the expected APIs. Therefore, although it released one matching call (`{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}` under the tool 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox'), the other required call ('legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with the `{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}` argument) was not invoked, making Objective 2 a failure. Due to Objective 2's failure, Objective 3 assessment officially results in a failure as well. However, additional data confirms that since the model uses other tool invocations (singular API calls with incorrect IPs and failed output) incorrectly before finally responding regarding 8.8.8.8 based on the remaining successfully acquired data afterward, the system's dependency on custom and misguided interventions still concludes Objective 3 remains a failure regardless."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model is required to make API calls to 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with the argument '{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}' and 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with the argument '{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'. The actual tool calls were:

1. 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with '{""ip"": ""288.288.288.288""}'
2. 'multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox' with '{""ips"": ""288.288.288.288""}'
3. 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with '{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}' (This call partially satisfies the requirement).
4. On giving the final answer, the model used 'Finish', which handles presentation but is not authorized to make it a functional requirement.

The API call to 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with '{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}' is correct. However, the 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' required API call with '{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}' was completely missing and replaced by an erroneous tool call to 'multiple_array_v2_for_blackbox' which differs by name and was invoked unsuccessfully with an invalid IP parameter it was never intended to process ('288.288.288.288' instead of '8.8.8.8'). Thus the requirement was not fulfilled, thereby causing both objectives to fail, as fulfillment of objective 2 hangs on a successful execution of objective 1."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls included:
1. artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data with 'is_id': ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" 
2. artist_overview_for_spotify_data with 'is_id': ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""
3. artist_albums_for_spotify_data with 'is_id': ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""

The actual tool calls made were:
1. artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data with 'is_id': ""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2"" 
2. artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data with 'is_id': ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" 
3. None for artist_overview_for_spotify_data 
4. None for artist_albums_for_spotify_data 

Only the second call to 'artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data' with the correct artist ID matched one of the required tools, but because the call to 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' and 'artist_albums_for_spotify_data' were not made as required, objective 1 results in failure. Due to this failure, Objective 3 fails inherently. The response emphasized issues around data retrieval from the APIs without achieving specific queries beyond those calls and despite repeated efforts indicating system errors."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked a single actual tool call, 'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{""is_id"":""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'. The expected API calls required by the instructions include two: 1) 'artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }' and 2) 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' with arguments '{ ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8"" }'. The invocations have a different ""is_id,"" and the complete second required tool 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' is missing entirely. Therefore, the objective 1 is a failure.

The error in fulfilling Objective 2 regarding API call accuracy directly implies a failure in Objective 3 – to effectively use data from API calls to fulfill the user's instruction. Moreover, although the model made some output effort, it was based on attempting to fetch the artist info again which implies that response is independent and inconclusive in terms of success for Objective 3. Thus, the retrieval of proper output fulfilling user's instruction cannot be claimed due to incorrect and incomplete tool calls and their utilization."
