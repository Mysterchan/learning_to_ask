1,"I have a package with the tracking number .YT9999999999 Can you track this package and give me the tracking information? Additionally, detect the carrier for this tracking number.",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
For Objective 2:
The tools called by the model are:
1. ""carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2"" with '{
    ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""
  }'
2. ""packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2"" with '{
    ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""
  }'

The required API calls are:
1. ""carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2"" with '{
    ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""
  }'
2. ""packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2"" with '{
    ""trackingNumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""
  }'

Both the required tool names and arguments in the actual tool calls match exactly with the expected employed (the case-insensitive parameter name ""trackingnumber"" vs. ""trackingNumber""), leading to Score Point: Successful.

2,"I need to track a package with the tracking number NY9999999990. Can you give me the tracking information of specific package? After finding the tracking information, detect the carrier for this tracking number",5,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
The required API calls match what the model invoked. The required tools were:
1. For `packages_v2_track_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments including equivalent {""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}.
2. For `carriers_detect_for_trackingmore_v2` with arguments including equivalent {""trackingnumber"": ""YT2003521266065328""}.
The model precisely invoked these API calls with the matching arguments.

For Objective 3, the model produces a valid and informative final answer, which effectively uses the data retrieved through API calls and fulfills the user's instruction to provide specific package tracking details, including following details:
- The carrier name (Yun Express).
- Status as not found giving error code.
- Includes operational direction like checking their website and provides a phone number for more help.
This combines the details needed to let the user follow up regarding their query, directly derived from the API's provided output."
3,I am looking for similar apps to the app with the ID 1053012309. Can you provide me with a list of similar apps and details of the app with the ID 1053012309?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: Upon comparing the expected API calls with the actual tool calls invoked by the model, both are fully aligned in terms of tool name (allowing for small variations in reference name) and identical arguments. The abstraction 'get_similar_apps_for_IOS_Store' and 'get_ios_app_for_ios_store' has semantic and syntactic association with the extracted demands '""get_similar_apps_for_ios_store""' and '""get_ios_app_for_ios_store""', respectively, assuring the 'is_id' query is dutifully present. As matching requests are correctly initiated with requisite parameters ('{""is_id"": ""1053012308""}'), Objective 2 is a success.

4,I am planning to play the Fantasy 5 lottery. Can you provide me with the winning number sets between 01-10-2023 and 01-01-2023?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call ""drawings_between_dates_for_fantasy_5"" with parameters `""date1"":""01-01-2023""`, `""date2"":""01-10-2023""` matches exactly the expected tool call with the same name and same argument details `'{ ""date1"": ""01-01-2023"", ""date2"": ""01-10-2023"" }'`. Therefore, Objective 2 is achieved as the crucial expected API call was made correctly. 

Furthermore, the final answer stated comprehensive winning number sets for the Fantasy 5 lottery for the given date range based explicitly on the data retrieved from the intended tool call. This was clearly made evident from the winning numbers listed per date which aligns with the dates and numbers from the tool API call's response regarding the 'drawing between dates for fantasy 5'. Consequently, Objective 3 is also successful as the final answer complies with user instruction and is derived using API response data."
5,"I am organizing a blockchain conference and would like to showcase the Address Monitor tool. Can you provide me with a list of addresses on the BSC mainnet '0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F' and their corresponding transactions? Also, I need to know the total number of transactions processed by the tool.",13,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool call required is:
- 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor' with '{\n  ""monitorAddressId"": ""8485d9c3-7f52-4ba7-8ec2-41543effa6ae""\n }'

However, the tools actually invoked by the model included 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor' multiple times but without any arguments, as reflected in calls:
- 'get_address_transactions_for_address_monitor' with '{}'

Since the arguments ('monitorAddressId') essential for successful invocation per the expected call were missing, objective 1 is failed. Given the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 automatically fails because the handling or passing of API call arguments is crucial for achieving accuracies determined by these API calls, regardless of whether or not a final response related precisely to the expected intention was delivered."
6,"I'm planning to set up a user front-end for my website. Can you determine if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is associated with any cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy services? Please also suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API calls made by the model included 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with the correct specified argument '{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}'. Therefore, this call aligns with one of the given expected calls:
- 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with parameters '{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}'.

However, the model failed to invoke the additional expected API call:
- 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with parameters '{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}'.

Without invoking all required expected calls, Objective 2 is identified as a failure. Because the execution of Objective 2 is in failure, Objective 3 is directly inferred as failure in accordance with the assessment guidelines. The model also gives a final answer based on the called 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' tool, suggesting actions based on detection results extracted from the queried API about the characteristics of the IP. However, since the examination determines Objective 2 as a failure due to an incomplete set of the expected API’s implementation, Objective 3 is by extension considered a failure irrespective of the content correctness thoroughly executed at this stage."
7,"I'm concerned about the security of my family's website. Can you check if the IP address 288.288.288.288 is detected as a cloud, hosting, Tor, or proxy service? Also, suggest any necessary actions based on the detection results.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected tool calls are [('legacy_v1_for_blackbox', '{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}'), ('singular_object_v2_for_blackbox', '{""ip"": ""8.8.8.8""}')]. The tool invoked by the model for IP checking matches the second expected call accurately: 'singular_object_v2_for_blackbox' with '{""ip"":""8.8.8.8""}'. However, the required tool 'legacy_v1_for_blackbox' with '{""ips"": ""8.8.8.8""}' is not invoked by the model. Since a required tool ('legacy_v1_for_blackbox') is not called, Objective 2 is met with failure, automatically making Objective 3 a failure as well."
8,"I'm interested in knowing the albums where a specific artist has appeared. Can you give me details about the albums where the artist with ID '6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2' has appeared? I would like to know the names, release dates, and cover art of these albums. Additionally, please provide the names of the artists who collaborated with the artist on these albums.",3,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model invoked the tool with the name and arguments ""artist_appears_on_for_spotify_data"" using ""{\""is_id\"":\""6x4yzr8BklMoXXLfgHnkk2\""}"", which does not match the expected artist ID requirement of ""{\""is_id\"":\""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8\""}"" from the tasks expected API calls. The required API call discussed either an incorrect is_id or did not call the additional necessary tools: 'artist_overview_for_spotify_data' and 'artist_albums_for_spotify_data' also with the arguments ""{\n  \""is_id\"": \""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8\""\n }"". Thus, Objective 2 fails as not all expected calls in the required API specification have been invoked.

Due to the failure of Objective 2, Objective 3 is a direct failure, hence independent efforts of validating Objective 3 through task accomplishment or user-request relevance with the given final output is unnecessary as per evaluation criteria setup."
9,"I'm planning to create a playlist of songs discovered by a particular artist. Can you provide me with a list of songs discovered by the artist with ID '7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9'? I would like to know the names, descriptions, and cover art of these songs. Furthermore, it would be great if you could tell me the names of the playlists that feature these songs.",19,3,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool calls did not match the tools invoked by the model. The required tool calls are (names and arguments should exactly or fundamentally match):
1. artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data with arguments {
    ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""
}
2. artist_overview_for_spotify_data with arguments {
    ""is_id"": ""2w9zwq3AktTeYYMuhMjju8""
}
However, the actual model-made tool calls involved different IDs for the artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data and artist_overview_for_spotify_data:
1. artist_discovered_on_for_spotify_data with arguments '{""is_id"":""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'
2. artist_overview_for_spotify_data with arguments '{""is_id"":""7m1xxb5HmtXaZZNvhBbii9""}'

These argument inconsistencies constitute inaccuracies versus expected calls; hence, Objective 2 represents a failure. Correspondingly, Objective 3 also results in a failure due to its dependency on tool call accuracy from Objective 2."
10,"I want to analyze the YouTube Channel. Please give me the the channel ID of the channel name 'mr.besst'. Then, provide me with the available details from the channel ID.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual API calls made were:
1. ""youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search"" with arguments '{""channelname"":""mrbeast""}'  
2. ""channel_details_for_youtube_search"" with arguments '{""channelid"":""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA""}'  

This perfectly matched the required API calls:
1. ""youtube_channel_id_for_youtube_search"" with logically equivalent arguments '{ ""channelname"": ""mrbeast"" }'
2. ""channel_details_for_youtube_search"" with logically equivalent arguments '{ ""channelid"": ""UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA"" }'

Therefore, Objective 2 is successful as all required tool calls described in the expected API calls hold exact comparisons with the tool names and their corresponding arguments from the actual tool invocations.

For Objective 3, the final answers and details retrieved from the tool calls, such as channel name, channel ID, and images, match and fulfill the user's instructions as received and displayed back in a neatly formatted textual answer. The completion of these Objectives supports a successful recognition of the replay and usage effectiveness of actual API calls and semantic interfacing to visually affirm linked database entries and derived facts matching user instructions."
11,I need to verify the validity of an email address. The email address I want to verify is testing.com,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The expected tool call detailed in 'required API calls' is:
{""name"": ""validate_email_for_validate_email"", ""arguments"": '{""email"": ""test@gmail.com""}'}

The actual tool call made by the model is:
{""name"": ""validate_email_for_validate_email"", ""arguments"": '{""email"":""test@gmail.com""}'}

The tool call arguments match exactly except for the extra unrequired spaces found in the string syntax of the arguments. Given it includes all necessary components correctly (tool name: ""validate_email_for_validate_email"" with the argument: ""email"" set accurately), the expectation is met under Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the response to confirming the tool was invoked for validating an email featured in the dialogue managed by referencing data retrieved from the API call to present detailed verification of every aspect (regular expression, typo detection, disposable email checks, MX records check, SMTP check). This ensured adherence and presented the resolved verification as ""The email address 'test@gmail.com' is valid. It has successfully passed all validation checks including MX and SMTP validations."" Similarly, a tool displaying capabilities (Finish) confirms delivery of the final generated answer platforming only valid perspectives given the preceding API's functionality and results.

Both objectives are aligned primarily by interdependent calm progression foundationally; even unenthusiastic potential disconnect influences conjure apt factual returns implied through API call-results logging while enlock steadfast disclosure reflection lacking encounter discrepancies forge clear outcomes."
12,"I would like to find out my age in months and days based on the date of birth '99999999'. Additionally, I need to know the available time zones to select the correct one for accurate results.",4,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: For Objective 2, the evaluation requires comparing the invoked tool by the model against the required API call. The actual tool call made includes 'age_calculator_for_age_calculator' with the exact argument of '{""date"": ""19870630""}', matching precisely with the required API call. Thus, Objective 2 is deemed successful.

For Objective 3, the revealed final response correctly achieved the user's instruction to calculate the age based on the input and present in months and days detailing any relevant information, including making references to the API-derived age data. As the final computation about age and months demarcates clear-headed data from the aforementioned tool calls and the structured placement addressing the user's instruction, this simulates success in Utilizing API results responsibly. Specifically, both aspects of the user's age from the birth date and accurate days elapsing up to retrieved date engineering are factual imprints of API-provided constituents, aligning judiciously and are milestones for solving a logical problem wholly with highlights from APIs."
13,I'm a music lover and I want to discover new songs on YouTube. Can you recommend some similar videos to my favorite song with the ID '5xxjJJKQ4y8'? It would be great to see the details and comments for each recommended video.,47,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool calls specified cannot be matched with any precise API calls in the information provided by the model. Comparing the actual tools used by the model against the expected tools:

1. 'suggested_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' was expected with arguments relating specifically to video ID ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", with ""part"" set to ""id,snippet"", and ""type"" to 'video'. Instead, the arguments utilized mismatch significantly by specifying a different ""relatedtovideoid"" (""5xxjJJKQ4y8"").

2. 'video_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' was required to fetch details for video ID ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", seeking parameters 'contentDetails,snippet,statistics'. The tool used various IDs other than ""7ghhRHRP6t4"", often retrieving drastically differing sets of detail types like limiting areas to ‘snippet’ next to expanding investigations on invalid, i.e., empty search results for newly selected videoids assigned far distinctly from the necesitously mentioned one.

3. 'video_comments_for_youtube_v3_v2' necessitated extracting comments for the ""videoid"" ""7ghhRHRP6t4"" with requested precision up to ""maxresults"": ""100"".

14,I'm planning a family movie night and I need to create a playlist of animated movies on YouTube. Can you fetch the videos from a playlist with the ID 'ASLpZt3vCjQVX'? It would be helpful to have the details and comments for each video.,34,2,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
The model made several API calls, but to evaluate Objective 2, we focus on two required API calls:
1. Expected: 'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""playlistid"":""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",""part"":""snippet""}'
   Actual: 'playlist_videos_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments 
   '{""playlistid"":""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",""part"":""snippet"",""maxresults"":""50""}'. 
   Here, the ""maxresults"" parameter being present does not inhibit matching this expectation, hence it’s judged correctly executed.

2. Expected: 'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments '{""is_id"":""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",""part"":""snippet""}'
   Actual: 'playlist_details_for_youtube_v3_v2' with arguments 
   '{""is_id"":""RDZiQo7nAkQHU"",""part"":""snippet""}'. 
   This exact match makes this assignment correctly executed.
   
Both expected tools were successfully called with correct or sufficiently matching arguments; extra provided arguments or slightly altered details don't affect the validity for Objective 2.

Using these API calls, the model successfully retrieved details about playlist videos despite encountering authentication issues. It moved on to perform general searches on YouTube, eventually detailing results related to animated movies. The argument presentation, search retrieval, and model’s response compilation from these tool Spicer concluded addressed the overall user's instruction efficiently.

For Objective 3, considering complete final tracking from questioned API Call response, constructing a list remained articulately associated with rigorous information verifying fully dependent culmination of tools employed makes the intake moving. Thus, End-round response generation from secured API data pulling off despite narrowed down communications reasonably configures Objective 3."
15,I'm a social media manager and I want to analyze the engagement of a specific Twitter account. Can you fetch the usernames of the followers of a Twitter user with the user ID '987654321'?,5,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
The expected API calls included:
1. The function name: 'user_s_followers_for_twitter' with arguments '{""user_id"": ""96479162""}', which is correctly invoked by the model with the exact name and identical arguments '{""user_id"":""96479162""}'.
2. The function name: 'user_s_likes_for_twitter' with arguments '{""user_id"": ""96479162""}', which was not invoked by the model at all.

Since the API ""user_s_likes_for_twitter"" which was expected to be invoked was not present among the tool calls made by the model, the assessment outcome for Objective 2 is a failure. Consequently, assuming the failure scenario where Objective 2 is indicated as a failure, Objective 3 also defaults to a failure regardless of the appropriateness or content in the model’s final output."
16,My company is launching a new product and we want to monitor its online presence. Can you search for tweets that mention our product name 'XYZADRHSDFDA' and have a minimum of 100 retweets? ,2,0,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required tool call is 'user_details_for_twitter' with the arguments ""{username: ""omarmhaimdat""}"". However, the API calls made by the model were 'search_for_twitter' with arguments ""{query: ""XYZADRHSDFDA"", min_retweets: 100}"". Since 'user_details_for_twitter' was neither invoked nor were the required arguments satisfied by the performed tool call, Objective 2 is a failure. Since Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 automatically fails regardless of the process or the outcome of the 'dense_passages_auto_searchjson25mixed_search', even if the answer was or was not given."
17,"I'm curious about the domain information for 'wikimania'. Could you retrieve the IP address, expiration date, and other relevant details? Additionally, check if 'wikipedia.org' and 'wikimedia.org' are similar.",28,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Reviewing the tool calls invoked by the model against the expected API calls, only one expected API call is described:
- Expected: 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3' with arguments '{""search"": ""google.com""}'
However, regarding the actual tool calls made by the model, multiple instances of the 'domain_information_for_whois_lookup_v3' function were invoked, only with varied argument:
- Actual various entries use 'domain_information_for_whois', the parameters and exact purpose varied from the specific expected requirement even though the necessary condition occasionally matched.
- Invocation for 'google.com' itself is indeed made but multiple calls targeting different domains (not single, definitive match continously using suffice parameter like 'search "": ""google.com"" consecutively leads to evaluation as a failure. 

Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 also fails because there needed error identification and computing processes limits on successes forwarding. Regardless, note that entered commentations by the model hinted towards validation reasoning—without appropriate data-driven backings visible outright from actual/tool collations showed targeted requests hints."
18,"I'm a data scientist and I need to compare the Fear and Greed index for multiple dates. Can you fetch the index scores for June 1st, 2025 and June 15th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The model was expected to call the 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' API with the argument '{""date"": ""2024-06-01""}'. However, the actual API calls made by the model were for the dates '2025-06-01', '2025-06-15', '2022-06-01', and '2022-06-15'. None of these match the expected call with the required argument for the year 2024. Since Objective 2 failed as it did not execute the required API call, Objective 3 fails as well."
19," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual API calls made include 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with the exact required parameter '{ ""date"": ""2024-02-18"" }'. While the model also called 'index_for_fear_and_greed_index' and 'Finish', these additional calls do not impact the success for Objective 2 since the expected API call was correctly executed with the necessary parameters. For Objective 3, the model incorporated the data obtained from the API to provide the final answer, using the fear and greed index marks and ratings for the specific dates, reflecting the input from the invoked APIs and conforming to the user's provided information."
20," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",6,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API call was ""{'name': 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index', 'arguments': '{""date"": ""2024-02-18""}'}"". None of the actual API calls made by the model, which looked up data for February 28th and 29th, 2025, correspond to the date specified in the expected API call. Even though the mechanism for calling 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' was correctly used, the wrong date argument ('2025-02-28' '2025-02-29' instead of '2024-02-18') means that the objective is not met.

Having already established a failure in Objective 2, it directly implies a failure in Objective 3. Moreover, the model itself failed to retrieve values for the dates due to systemic limitations or mistakes (trying to access future dates or wrong formatting), and it ultimately could not give a correct or any final answer to the instruction."
21," Please provide me with the Fear and Greed index scores for for Feb 30th, 2025 and Feb 31th, 2025? Additionally, I would like to know the rating for each date.",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call according to the prompt is for the function 'historical_for_fear_and_greed_index' with the argument '{""date"":""2024-02-18""}'. The model made a matching function call from its tools invocation list with the function ""historical_for_fear_and_greed_index"" and perfectly matching argument '{""date"":""2024-02-18""}'. This not only matches verbatim with the expected function name but also the argument pattern and value, satisfying the criteria for Objective 2's success.

For Objective 3, the model successfully used the result of the API call in providing the user's requested final answer about the Fear and Greed index for February 18th, 2024, stating the Fear and Greed index indicates 'fear' with an index score specified. The model connected the fetched API data about the index score of 77.29 with a mention immediately in the summary answer that encapsulated the mood of the market on that date as ""fearing."" In this way, there is a clear linkage between the API call output and the final stated output in the response provided by the model matching what the API call returned for Objective 3."
22,"My friend is a huge fan of a particular TV show, and I want to surprise them with some interesting information. Can you give me the trailers for the show with the title ID 90068472? I would like to know the availability of the trailers and the contextual synopsis for each trailer.",7,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tools invoked by the model and the expected tool calls are compared as follows:
- Actual tool call: 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{""is_id"":""90068472""}'
- Actual tool call: 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{""ids"":""90068472""}'
- Expected tool call: 'title_trailers_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{ ""is_id"": ""80057281"" }'
- Expected tool call: 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with arguments '{ ""ids"": ""80057281"" }'

In both required API calls, the argument values differ from the actual calls (90068472 vs. 80057281), thus Objective 2 fails as the correct API calls with the expected arguments were not made. Due to the failure in Objective 2, Objective 3 also fails directly without evaluation of the actual outcome based on tool data usage."
23,"I'm organizing a movie night with my family and friends. I need suggestions for movies similar to the one with the title ID 90068472. Could you provide me with a list of similar titles along with their availability, contextual synopsis, and genres? Limit the response to 25 titles.",8,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: 
1. For Objective 2, comparing the required API calls against the tools invoked by the model:
   - Required:
     1. 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' with '{""is_id"": ""80057281""}'
     2. 'title_details_for_netflix_data' with '{""ids"": ""80057281""}'
   - Actual:
     1. 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' invoked twice with '{
          ""is_id"":""80057281"",
          ""limit"":""25""
        }', which matches the required API call. It includes an additional parameter ""limit,"" which is acceptable as per the guidelines.
     2. 'title_details_for_netflix_data' invoked with '{
          ""ids"":""80057281""
        }', which directly matches the required API call for details.

   Both required tools and arguments were invoked correctly by the model.

2. For Objective 3, the response indicated:
   - The initial and subsequent queries by tool 'title_similars_for_netflix_data' yielded no results (""response:"" []""), and further searches by 'search_for_netflix_data' also produced no results.
   - Close attention to the 'Tool Calls' section does not reveal any data amalgamated into the input received by the ""Finish"" function, dominated by data absence and interpretation from previous unsuccessful calls.
   
Although tools were utilized correctly, the inability to respond adequately to the user's query, which sought titles similar to ""90468472"" initially intended as ""80057281"", persisted throughout the scenario. The assistant handles the final response with a straightforward dismissal owed to the ineffectiveness inherent in the accessed titles leaving Objective 3 with failure notice despite achieving a functional-call-centric stride."
24,"My company is launching a new website. Can you analyze the domain ourbusinessplatform123124.net and provide information about its age, including the domain age, creation date, and expiration date? It would also be helpful to know the website's whois information.",3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The expected API calls included 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with arguments '{""website"":""getecz.com""}' and 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with arguments '{""website"":""getecz.com""}'. The actual API call made by the model correctly invoked 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with the argument '{""website"":""getecz.com""}'. However, it failed to make the required API call 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro', which was essential for a complete analysis. This missed API call leads to the failure of Objective 2 and thus directly results in the failure of Objective 3."
25,"I want to optimize the loading speed of my website ourbusinessplatform1234567.net. Can you analyze its loading speed and provide recommendations based on the audit results? Additionally, I would like to know the loading experience score and any audit warnings.",6,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls were:
1. 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with arguments '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'
2. 'onpage_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with arguments '{""website"": ""getecz.com""}'

The actual API calls made by the model were:
1. 'loading_speed_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with arguments '{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}'
2. 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with arguments '{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}'
3. 'on-page_seo_analyze_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' with arguments '{""website"":""ourbusinessplatform1234567.net""}'

The invoked tools do not match the specific API call parameters given in the expected API calls such as the specific website differentiating the calls ('getecz.com' vs. 'ourbusinessplatform1234567.net'), and 'domain_data_for_website_analyze_and_seo_audit_pro' was invoked instead of the on-page SEO tool. These discrepancies suggest the model did not activate the appropriate APIs as per the expectation and thus failing Objective 2.

Since Objective 2 failed because of the incorrect tool invocation, I can directly determine that Objective 3 is also a failure, disregarding the correctness or relevance of the final answer derived from the API responses."
26,I am a student and I need help with my math homework. Can you help me to differentiate the following mathematical expression: 'What is going on2'?,6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The only expected API call was 'differentiate_for_mathematical_symbolic_expression_manipulator' with arguments `{ ""expression"": ""2*x^2 + 3*x + 1"", ""variable"": ""x""}`. However, in the call logs provided, this tool was called with correct arguments resulting in the derivation processing, but the finalize functions and validation calls made are an addition and not part of required actions. Since it added those actions which extended beyond the process needed directly re-engraves, therefore, fulfilling the expected call, but also resulting in an expanded result due to additional invalid function calls which were strictly not expected based on the definition, invalidating the objective.

The failure in Objective 2 directly implies a failure in Objective 3, thus the detailed analysis or verification pertaining to Objective 3 is redundant here. Moreover, no ""give_answer"" return with the expected final communication was active, showing the inherent collapse in completing the user's instruction based on the disrupted API effectiveness and final goal attainment interruption."
27,I am interested in learning more about a specific Instagram user. Can you provide me with the detailed profile information and the name for the user with the Instagram name 'leomesssi'?,4,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls include 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile' with argument '{""username"": ""leomessi""}' and 'get_story_for_instagram_profile' with argument '{""username"": ""leomessi""}'. The tools invoked by the model correctly identify and use 'get_profile_info_for_instagram_profile' with the specified parameters but fail to call 'get_story_for_instagram_profile'. Since one expected API call is not executed, it leads to a failure in objective 1. Since objective 1 is not met, objective 2 automatically fails. Missing the retrieval of the story information for the Instagram profile is critical, thus, even if the necessary profile data was gathered, the task requirements of outputting all intended data are not fully met due to skipped API function necessary for a comprehensive resolution."
28,"I am looking for the definition, pronunciation, and example usages of the word 'onomatopoeiaa'. Can you provide me with this information?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call made by the model was 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary' with arguments '{""term"":""onomatopoeia""}'. The required tool call was also 'define_a_word_search_for_urban_dictionary' with arguments '{""term"": ""onomatopoeia""}'. Both the tool and argument match exactly, meeting the expectation for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, after reviewing the final answer provided by the model and comparing it to the data retrieved from the actual tool invocation responses, the final answer encapsulates the information concerning the definition and examples of the word ""onomatopoeia."" Since the final answer, which described the word in terms of its definition and sample usages, aligns with the tool response and accomplishes the user's instructions, Objective 3 is achieved successfully."
29,I am planning a trip to Europe and would like to convert 1000 JPP to EUR. Can you provide me with the current exchange rate and the converted amount in EUR?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required API call 
'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data' with arguments '{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"", ""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}' matches exactly with the tool call that was executed 
'currency_exchange_rate_for_real_time_finance_data' with arguments '{""from_symbol"": ""JPY"",""to_symbol"": ""EUR""}'.
For Objective 3, the Assistant accurately replied based on the fetched exchange rate, accounting for proper calculations for the provided example and effectively used the obtained exchange rate of 0.0062 EUR for 1 JPY to respond appropriately that 1000 JPY is equivalent to 6.20 EUR, personalized to the user instruction for converting JPY to EUR using the realized rate. This indicates that the tool's response indeed informed the assistant's final answer as displayed in the ""give_answer"" sequence. Hence, this meets Objective 3."
30,"I need a list of trending pages on 9GAG along with their posts. Also, fetch the comments for a specific post and show me the user profile of 'hugo1232fesfgerwt'.",109,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specified is for 'get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed' with the argument 'username: ""kleido007""'. The actual tool calls invoked by the model attempted various 'get_posts_from_page_for_get_9gag_api_detailed', 'get_categories_for_get_9gag_api_detailed', 'get_posts_from_category_for_get_9gag_api_detailed', and a call to get a user profile which was aimed at 'hugo1232fesfgerwt', signaled by an incorrect component in sustaining sequences against the demanded profile name ""kleido007"". Since the function intended to recover 'kleido007' wasn't summoned correctly as per requirement mandates, it summarizes a failure for Objective 2.

Also, fetch the download link for any videos in a post.",68,6,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call is ""get_user_profile_for_get_9gag_api_detailed"" with arguments '{""username"": ""kleido007""}'. The report involves a variety of API calls corresponding to different functions such as fetching posts from specific categories, listing categories, and fetching user profiles for a username ""hugo1232fesfgerwt"", but nowhere in the multitude of the logs is the specified API call with the necessary argument ('kleido007' username). All records mention attempts with 'hugo1232fesfgerwt' as the argument instead of 'kleido007'.
Since there is a mismatch in the arguments (username not 'kleido007'), Objective 2 fails setting an automatic inference for Objective 3's failure due to incorrect or incomplete data transactions based on user instructions."
32,"I'm a music lover and want to discover TikTok videos featuring a specific song. Can you fetch the music information for the song with the ID '8394725634879021564'? Additionally, retrieve the videos that feature this song.",8,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason:
In term of the required API calls:
1. Required tool: 'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments '{""url"": ""7002634556977908485""}'
2. Required tool: 'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments '{""music_id"": ""7002634556977908485"", ""count"": ""20"", ""cursor"": ""0""}'

The tools called by the model instead are:
1. Actual tool call: 'get_music_info_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments '{""url"": ""8394725634879021564""}' and another attempt with the correct URL formatting but the same ID '{""url"": ""https://vm.tiktok.com/8394725634879021564""}'.
2. Actual tool call: 'get_music_post_video_list_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments '{""count"": ""10"", ""cursor"": """", ""music_id"": ""8394725634879021564""}'.

Here, neither IDs in the actual tool calls match the required '7002634556977908485'. Additional errors in the second tool include the mismatch in 'count' and 'cursor' without matching to required args of 'count': '20' and 'cursor': '0'. Therefore, completeness and meritable command is not achieved hence objectives fail due to the failure of Objective 2, which necessitates breakdown in successful conclusion in Objective 3."
33,"I need to analyze the engagement of a TikTok user's followers. Can you retrieve the follower list for a user with the ID '64556346745'? Also, fetch the user information for these followers.",7,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call specified was 'get_user_following_list_for_tiktok_download_video' with arguments containing ""user_id"" as ""107955"" and additional parameters ""count"" as ""50"" and ""time"" as ""0"". Instead, the API calls made by the model were 'user_follower_list_for_tiktok_download_video' with a user_id ""64556346745"" and ""count"" as ""200"" in one instance, and ""user_id"" as ""107955"" and ""count"" as ""200"" in another instance. This incorrect alignment also included other parameters like ""get_user_info_for_tiktok_download_video"", which was not required. Thus, the actual tool calls do not align with the expected correct tool name nor the required parameters, leading to a failure to accurately match and invoke the required API call, confirmed by checking JSON arguments format and values. This directly indicates that since the necessary API call was not invoked as expected, the objective 2 conclusion of failing is based on a failure in the chain from objective 1."
34,"Fetch the channel points info for the streamer 'dfasagergs'. Additionally, provide the stream view info and the streamer's details.",5,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: 
The expected API calls required arguments with the channel name as ""xqc,"" while the actual API calls had all arguments specifying the channel as ""dfasagergs."" Here are the discrepancies:

1. Expected: 'get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api' had the expected argument '{""channel"": ""xqc""}'.
   Actual: 'get_channel_points_context_for_twitch_api' used '{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}'.
   
2. Expected: 'get_stream_views_for_twitch_api' had the expected argument '{""channel"": ""xqc""}'.
   Actual: 'get_stream_views_for_twitch_api' used '{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}'.
   
3. Expected: 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with arguments '{ ""channel"": ""xqc"" }'.
   Actual: 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' validates with '{""channel"": ""dfasagergs""}'.

Since all the actual tool calls used an entirely different channel name (""dfasagergs"") instead of the required ""xqc,"" the evaluation results in failure for Objective 2 which implies a direct failure for Objective 3 as well, despite the contextual adequacy of using information from other elements some tool responses."
35,Find the streamer 'shadoune66666' streamer's info.,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model made this actual tool call:
- Function: 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api', Arguments: '{""channel"":""shadoune666""}'

The required API call was:
- Name: 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api', Arguments: '{ ""channel"": ""shadoune666"" }'

The actual tool call invoked the 'get_streamer_info_for_twitch_api' with the appropriate argument (""channel"": ""shadoune666""), which aligns correctly with the required API call thereby achieving a successful result for Objective 2.

For Objective 3, the final answer returned was adequate:
Finish function handling the final expression as: ""Streamer 'shadoune666' Info:\n- Name: shadoune666\n- User ID: 36533048\n- Current Stream: No active stream."",
which matches and is based on the API data retrieval of ""shadoune666"" details. It successfully employed the retrieved API data. Hence, Objective 3 is also successful as the model's response correctly executes the user's instruction based on API data."
36,"provide me with the product details for a barcode I have, which is 286193748563.",18,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The objective 1 requires the following API call to be invoked with specific arguments:
- Function Name: 'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls'
- Arguments: '{""upc"": ""194574942221""}'

From the logs provided, the tool call for 'products_search_by_barcode_for_kohls' was made for two separate instances:
1. First instance with arguments {'upc': '286193748563'}
2. Second instance with arguments {'upc': '194574942221'}

Although the required tool call is present in the second instance, the response ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" suggests incomplete use. Additionally, the presence of the unused, incorrect first invocation (Argument: '286193748563') does affect the fulfillment of the expected goal.

For objective 2, since objective 1 is a failure, which already provides for objective 2's being marked as a failure as well. Imperative, follow-up details requested based on queried lookup but missing responses also suggest inefficiency in achieving data-driven, instructive utility."
37,"I'm redecorating my home and looking for furniture options. Can you list the available furniture products on Kohls? Also, provide me with the product reviews for a specific product with webID 5372023.",14,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual API tool calls made by the model includes 'reviews_list_for_kohls' with '{""productid"": ""5372023""}', executed twice, along with other non-required tools such as 'products_list_for_kohls', 'categories_list_for_kohls', and a final summarize tool. The expected API call frowned required the function 'reviews_list_for_kohls' with '{""productid"": ""4201989""}'. Thus, the model failed to invoke the mandated tool call with the specified argument leading to a failure in Objective 2. Because Objective 3 is dependent directly on the completion of Objective 2 (as provided in the evaluation rules) and no correct final answer continuation was logically based on accurate data retrieval—in this contrast specifically from a mandatory tool—they lead to failing Objective 3 as well. The final API call to 'Finish' drawing conclusion unrelated to initial actual retrieval confirms it doesn't compensate for the expected calls failure."
38,"I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this product, including images, pricing, and customer reviews?",28,2,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: Upon analyzing the JSON content, the required API tool calls are:
1. 'products_detail_for_wayfair' with arguments '{""sku"": ""W003247135""}',
2. 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' with arguments '{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'.

However, the actual tools called by the model are 'products_search_for_wayfair' and 'reviews_list_for_wayfair', but they do not meet the exact requirement ('products_detail_for_wayfair' was expected but 'products_search_for_wayfair' was invoked). Although the expected arguments match exactly for 'reviews_list_for_wayfair', missing the correct call for 'products_detail_for_wayfair' leads to a failure in Objective 2.

Subsequently, as Objective 2 fails, Objective 3 also fails as outlined in the guidelines, without consideration of the response content or further evaluation. Additional intention to retry or change approach contained in the subsequent actions does not rectify the failed status, nor does the mutated SKU keyword searches correct the required course of action."
39,I'm a blogger and I want to write a detailed review of a specific product with SKU X005789621. Can you provide me with all the information about this productand provide reviews for these products?,37,4,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API calls specified the use of 'products_detail_for_wayfair' and 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' both for descriptor '{""sku"": ""W003247135""}'. While 'reviews_list_for_wayfair' was indeed used by invoking the specific SKU from multiple tool calls, the 'products_detail_for_wayfair' was not found. Instead, API tools like 'products_search_for_wayfair', 'products_list_for_wayfair', and other irrelevant functions are called in order to search for products by keyword (like 'bathroom vanity'). This mismatch signifies not all essential APIs were utilized, thus failing both Objective 2 (missing tool of the required API Frontplaces APIs), altogether asserting failure in Objective 3 as no final relevant results based on the specific requested data were successfully shown."
40,My friend is interested in buying a new laptop. Could you fetch the reviews and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.,6,2,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model were '{""productid"": ""3OM3PS""}' for both 'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' and 'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2'. However, the expected argument required a complete product ID which is '{""productId"": ""B00K3OM3PS""}'. The incorrect and incomplete productId parameter caused the discrepancy. Because Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 concluded to be a failure regardless of any other context, resulting in a direct failure to achieve user instructions using credible data from the tools. Additionally, the response about the limitation and inability confirms that the intended information was indeed not retrieved, fulfilling the failure criteria for Objective 3 by confirming non-implementation of directive functionality based on valid data."
41,"I am looking to buy a new laptop. Can you fetch the search results for 'Mac' on Amazon? Additionally, provide me with the product details, reviews, and offers for the product with ID 3OM3PS.",4,1,Failure,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool calls made by the model were 'get_product_s_offers_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2', 'get_product_s_reviews_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2', and 'get_awesome_product_details_for_amazon_data_scraper_v2' all with arguments containing `""productid"": ""B06XWB7DPS""`. While the required API calls are the same three functions, the arguments according to the requirement should carry the `productId` ""B00K3OM3PS"" but instead, they target the productId ""B06XWB7DPS"". This discrepancy in the product ID in all function arguments led to the failure of Objective 2. Additionally, since Objective 2 failed, achieving Objective 3 is automatically deemed a failure without evaluating if the final response logically resulted from APIs being correctly called."
42,My friends and I are huge F1 fans. We want to attend a race this season. Could you please  provide the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The tool invocation as per the chat logs perfectly matches the required API call. Both the API tool invocation by the model ('select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with argument '{""is_id"":""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}') and the expected API call ('select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with argument '{ ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7""}') share identical function names and argument values, satisfying Objective 2.

For Objective 3, despite correctly retrieving the required race details, the final answer which fulfills the user’s instruction is missing in the logs provided. With no ""give_answer"" field containing the sum-up of using this retrieved data to solve the user's query, thereby directly impacting the assessment outcome based on user intervention, which points to a requirement of manual response hence failing Objective 3 due to the inability to independently use the processed API data for final user capable to be by the system itself without manual input."
43,I am a racing enthusiast and I want to plan a trip to watch an F1 race. Please provide me with the race details for the race with the ID d27e0de553b9d7.,6,1,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The required API call was 'select_race_based_on_id_for_f1_race_schedule' with the argument wherein 'is_id' should be '6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7'. However, the model incorrectly used the argument key ""is_id"": ""6141c76615d27e0de553b9d7"" instead of the correct key 'id', resulting in a failure to meet the set criteria for Objective 2. Consequently, Objective 3 fails per the condition that a failure in Objective 2 leads directly to failing Objective 3 as well. Additionally, no final answer from the 'Finish' tool correlated to resolving the specific query about the race ID and its linked information, meaning Objective 3 criteria were not met in the treatments."
44,"Could you please provide me with the stock details for the symbol QQQQ? I'm interested in knowing the P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, and target price. It would be great to have the sales, gross margin, and employees information as well. Thank you!",6,1,Success,Success,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model is 'symbol_for_stock_data' with arguments '{""symbol"":""TQQQ""}'. Meanwhile, the expected API call is 'symbol_for_stock_data' with arguments '{\n  ""Symbol"": ""TQQQ""\n}'. Though the case of the key is different (""symbol"" in actual vs. ""Symbol"" in expected), API usually treats keys in a case-insensitive manner. The actual necessary tool calls match with the expected tool calls requirement including the argument values, hence Objective 2 results in a success.

For Objective 3, there's no final user response provided in the format '""give_answer""' mentioning if the user's instruction to retrieve a complete set of details including P/E ratio, EPS (etc.) has been achieved or not. Furthermore, in the dataset sequence there is a complete surrender of the task with an assistant comment, ""Due to the limitation of toolset, I cannot solve the question."" which further indicates no fulfilled user intent, resulting in Objective 3's failure."
45,I am a League of Legends player and I want to know the base stats of a specific champion. Can you provide me with the base stats for the champion 'raven'?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The actual tool call invoked by the model was 'get_a_specific_champion_s_base_stats_for_league_of_legends_stats' with arguments '{""name"":""riven""}', which matches exactly with the required API call '{ ""name"": ""riven""}'. The only issue was with semantic space difference which doesn't impact retrieval functionality or semantic meaning. Regarding Objective 3, the final answer using the 'Finish' tool call specifically responded to and provided the League of Legends champion Riven’s stats as described in the tool response, correlating cleanly to the semantic requirement to provide such mentioned data after confirming exact champion details from 'League of Legends', which concludes on a derived result directly relevant to the conducted API call. Hence, both objectives are met directionally correlating to the user request fulfillment through proper pull of API calls and subsequent usage to derive the expected final output."
46,I am looking to buy a new phone. Can you provide me with the product details for the ASIN B07ZPKBL9V1?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The required tool call for checking Amazon product details was 'product_details_for_real_time_amazon_data' with the argument '{ ""asin"": ""B07ZPKBL9V"" }'. The model successfully invoked this exact tool call with '{ ""asin"":""B07ZPKBL9V""}', allowing us to tick off Objective 2 as a success. Additionally, the model responded appropriately and directly used the information from the API's response in the final tool 'Finish'. It gave details about the product which were derived directly from current data on Amazon through the API call. This, thereby, fulfills the user's request using tool outputs which assures success in Objective 3 as the answer is data-driven while entirely consistent and relevant to the provided product details from the Amazon API."
47,"I am a language enthusiast and I want to translate a text 'Hello, how are you?' to 'fri' language. Can you help me with this?",3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: The model correctly invoked the required API for translating text:
- Actual tool call: ""translate_for_translate_all_languages"" with arguments '{""text"":""Hello, how are you?"",""tolang"":""fr""}'
- Expected tool call: ""translate_for_translate_all_languages"" with arguments '{\n  ""text"": ""Hello, how are you?"",\n  ""toLang"": ""fr""\n }'
Although the key name is slightly different (""tolang"" versus ""toLang""), it seems to accept or normalize these due to flexible key input, as derived from the successful API response.

The model translated the sentence ""Hello, how are you?"" to French correctly as reflected in the translation ""Bonjour comment allez-vous?"".
It processed the translation data appropriately by announcing the successful reception of the translated text and issuing a stated finish which led to producing the final answer in question.

Additionally, there was a 'Finish' tool enacted for final answer formatting, and it successfully emitted a formatted response which showed ""The translation of 'Hello, how are you?' to French is 'Bonjour comment allez-vous?'"". This culminated in finishing the task satisfactorily as instructed upon attendant directives in assistant communications.""', as seen in the response '{""response"":""successfully giving the final answer.""}'."
48,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the date '9999-99-99' is a working day in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- For Objective 2: The actual tool calls invoked include ""get_1_3_get_info_day_for_working_days"" with arguments '{""country_code"":""US"",""date"":""2022-12-31""}'. The expected tool call was ""get_info_day_for_working_days"" with the same arguments. Despite a slight naming difference (""get_1_3_"" prefix), the essential API function name reflects intentions aligning with the expected call, and exact arguments are used. Encountering truncated or generally varied naming presentation still upkeeps in reflecting the correct function intended in expectations.

- For Objective 3: The final response provided to the user was ""December 31, 2022, is not a working day in the US as it falls on a weekend."" This outcome is directly rooted in the data furnished through functioning API call understanding and confirmed results. Through deduction, it closely connects with and represents the tool call results, and thus, unresolved deniable intentions are returned. Direct operations and aspirations derived responses completely reinforce return tool stats towards arising user query aspects."
49,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know if the period from start date '2013-12-31' to end date '2013-01-31' is a working period in the US. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Success,Success,"Reason: 
- The required API call ""analyse_for_working_days"" with arguments ""{\n  ""start_date"": ""2013-01-01"",\n  ""end_date"": ""2013-12-31"",\n  ""country_code"": ""US""\n }"" corresponds to the actual tool call ""get_1_3_analyse_for_working_days"" with '{""country_code"":""US"",""start_date"":""2013-01-01"",""end_date"":""2013-12-31""}'. Despite the slightly different names due to internal reference differences, three arguments and their integrity are on-point preserving parameter contents, fulfilling the requirement for objective 1.
- In terms of Objective 3, the final objective was to provide working days, total days, weekend days, and public holiday calculation for the period from ""2013-01-01"" to ""2013-12-31"" in the US, implemented using resultant API response adhering to API log and matching prerequisite attributes matched towards a corresponding public oriented result-generating approach thereby confirming during the final outcome reflects upon and substantially retrieves data via these API calls with desired continuity."
50,I am planning a trip to the US and I want to know the date and time after adding 2004 hours to the start date '2013-12-31' and start time '25:15'. Can you provide me with this information?,3,0,Success,Failure,Failure,"Reason: The actual tool invoked by the model was 'get_1_3_add_working_hours_for_working_days' with arguments '{""country_code"":""US"",""increment_time"":""2004:00"",""start_date"":""2013-12-31"",""start_time"":""08:15""}', which is meant to handle a similar task as specified in the required API call however the naming was truncated and argument format does not match exactly. This is actually not recognized correctly because '2004:00' for 'increment_time' anticipates a time format (probably hours and minutes), diverging from the value '2004' expected by the task goal (understanding required total hours directly). Additionally, the tool name does not correctly match the expected 'add_working_hours_for_working_days'. Misalignment between function names and types/debug details in function call arguments led to the Objective 2 failure. Since Objective 2 failed, Objective 3 thereby also fails]"")"
