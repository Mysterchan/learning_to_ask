Calculate the number of years by subtracting the birth year of the younger person from the birth year of the older person.\n2. Calculate the number of months by subtracting the birth month of the younger person from the birth month of the older person.\n3. If the number of months is negative, we subtract it from 12 and decrease the number of years by 1.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code and calculate the age difference.\nI will use the \"date_diff_years_months\" function to calculate the age difference in years and months.\n\n1. First, I need to define the birth dates of the two people as variables:\n   birthDate1 = '19970228'\n   birthDate2 = '19870630'\n\n2. Next, I will call the \"date_diff_years_months\" function and provide the two birth dates as inputs:\n   date_diff_years_months(birthDate1, birthDate2)\n\n3. Finally, I will check the output of the function to get the age difference in years and months.\n\nLet's implement this plan and calculate the age difference.",

Calculate the number of months by subtracting the birth month of the younger person from the birth month of the older person.\n3. If the number of months is negative, we subtract it from 12 and decrease the number of years by 1.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code and calculate the age difference.\nI will use the \"date_diff_years_months\" function to calculate the age difference in years and months.\n\n1. First, I need to define the birth dates of the two people as variables:\n   birthDate1 = '19970228'\n   birthDate2 = '19870630'\n\n2. Next, I will call the \"date_diff_years_months\" function and provide the two birth dates as inputs:\n   date_diff_years_months(birthDate1, birthDate2)\n\n3.
